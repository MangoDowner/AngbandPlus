    <h1 align=center>Langband compatibility</h1>
    
    <p>
      Most of the code is derived from Vanilla Angband 2.9.0 and many
      of the function names are taken directly from the Vanilla-code
      but some are changed and more will be changed as things
      progresses and Langband finds its own system to do things in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Important simple changes is that all Angband underscores are now
      hyphens, and that the code relies very little on global
      variables (ie dungeon tables, player object, etc).
    </p>

    <p>Some functions have lost name and others have been drastically
      changed: </p>

    <pre>
      Angband:         Langband:
      rand_int         random
      randint          randint
      /                int-/
      make_gold        create-gold
      floor_carry      let-floor-carry!

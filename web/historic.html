    <h3>Historic screenshots</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> 2nd of June: I finally have built enough datastructures to
	display the <a href="dumps/lang1.jpg">town</a>.</li>
      
      <li> 3rd of June: The <a href="dumps/lang2.jpg">player</a> has shown
	up, and he can be moved around :-)</li> 
      
      <li> 14th of June: This was done earlier, but here is a screen capture of the
	<a href="dumps/lang-birth.jpg">race-selection</a></li>
      <li> 27th of August: The first evidence that the
	<a href="dumps/cave.jpg">cave generation</a> is on its way</li>
      <li> 27th of August: The second indication that the
	<a href="dumps/cave2.jpg">cave generation</a> is on its way</li>
      <li> 27th of August: And some <a href="dumps/cave3.jpg">floors</a>
	within the rooms are nice..</li>
      <li> 27th of August: Removed overlapping, but should make sure
	that the player stands on <a href="dumps/cave4.jpg">floor</a>. </li>
      <li> 28th of August: Tunnels and some doors are placed on the
	map.  The player is still placed oddly, but things look much
	<a href="dumps/cave5.jpg">better</a>.</li>
      <li> 16th of September: Generates a PPM of the dungeon which is
	easily converted to a <a href="dumps/map.gif">gif</a>.  This is
	preliminary support for later graphic-display, and also helps
	me to keep track of how dungeons look overall.</li>
      <li> 16th of September: Also able to generate the map to an
	<a href="dumps/map.ascii">ascii file</a>.</li>
      <li> 17th of September: Tweaking to map file-output; shows
	player in blue, secret doors in orange, walls in gray, closed
	doors in burgund, open/broken doors in light blue and floors
	in white.  A <a href="dumps/map2.gif">gif</a> and the corresponding
	<a href="dumps/map2.ascii">ascii</a> map.</li>
      <li> 19th of September: Much small tweaking done, and the GTK+
	version should be working.  Thanks to Robert Rühlmann for
	main-gtk.c I used as a starting-point.  Also added some of the
	left frame for this <a href="dumps/gtk-town.jpg">shot</a> of the
	town in a simple GTK+ window.</li>
      <li> 21th of September: A simple screen <a
	href="dumps/explore.jpg">capture</a> of a @ exploring 
	the (relatively empty) dungeon. </li>
      <li> 22th of September: YA simple screen <a
	href="dumps/objdun.jpg">capture</a> of a @ exploring 
	the (relatively empty) dungeon, but this time the brave
	adventurer can find objects and gold. </li>
      <li> 8th of October: The character is out exploring and shows
	what he has <a href="dumps/inven.jpg">found</a>.  He's even
	found some gold on his trek. </li>
      <li> 12th of October: The character is out for a stroll in the
	towne, and what does he see.. <a
	href="dumps/inhabit.jpg">inhabitants</a>.</li>

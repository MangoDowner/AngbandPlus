    <h1>Langband technical intro</h1>

    <p>Langband, though based on Angband and feels pretty alike when
      playing it, is very different when you look at the code.  It is
      written in a different language, structured differently and
      assuming any code-resemblance with standard Angband may prove
      problematic.  Writing another "variant" with a drastic difference
      with the Angband code-base, which many good variants have been
      based on, might seem like a crazy project.  It might very well be
      a crazy project, but sometimes one has to be crazy to further the
      development. </p>
    
    <p>On the positive side, Langband possess some qualities over the
      standard Angband code-base:</p>
    
    
    <table border=1 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5 width=600 bgcolor="#D0F0D0">

      <tr valign=top><td>
	  <h2>Langband advantages</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li> It is written in a different, and more powerful language:
	      Common Lisp.  Common Lisp is a high-level programmable programming
	      language with an advanced object system and strong functional
	      roots.  This language removes 
	      the need for a separate scripting-language which the
	      Angband-developers have wanted to add to Angband for a long time.
	      Unlike classical scripting, Common Lisp code is compiled to native
	      code and the "scripting" can exploit the full code of
	      Langband.</li>
	    
	    <li>Angband is a large program of more than 100 000 lines of code,
	      and with more than a hundred global variables.  The code, though
	      well-commented and exceptionally structured for C-code, has most
	      game-play and possibly customisable code hard-coded and any change
	      is tough work and, more often than not: complex work.  Langband
	      has a different strategy; a small customisable engine for the
	      basic parts, which a "variant" uses and adds details to.  This
	      means that Langband is an engine which variants can use/be plugged
	      into.  The size of the Langband code, engine and variant, is much
	      smaller than the corresponding Angband code.</li>
	    
	    <li>Langband uses the object system of Common Lisp liberally, and
	      Angband has in many ways been turned into an object-oriented
	      program.  This object-orientation is central in making the engine
	      extensible and customisable.  Only a selected few areas of the
	      code have been made into non-extensible constructs to optimise
	      speed in places where this is needed. </li>
	    
	    <li>[Add more later.]</li>
	    
	  </ul>
	</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>But we might want to jump to the technical side of Langband,
      how things are structured.</p>


    <table border=1 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5 width=600 bgcolor="#F0F0F0">

      <tr valign=top><td>

	  <h2>Engine &lt;-&gt; Variant &lt;-&gt; Level</h2>

	  <p>[Please note that all parts of the code is written in CAPS-LOCK
	    here to be visible in the text.  You're very strongly encouraged
	    to write in only small letters any code to avoid breaking
	    compatibility.]</p>
	  
	  <p> A variant is an encapsulation of all the features which make
	    the game fun to play:  fun levels, objects, monsters, classes,
	    races, flavouring of objects and fun rooms.  All these things can
	    be customised for a variant, and the engine has nothing of this
	    hardcoded.  Other parts of the engine may also be customised;
	    equipment handling, shops, etc. </p>

	  <p>The variant object is available to the engine and it's own code
	    in the global dynamical variable <code>*VARIANT*</code>, just as
	    the player object is available in the <code>*PLAYER*</code>
	    variable. </p>

	  <p>Also available globally is the <code>*LEVEL*</code> object,
	    which points to the current level explored.  The engine provides a
	    random level (<code>RANDOM-LEVEL</code>) type which is the basic
	    random level which is probable to be common among variants, but a
	    variant may tailour this and add new level-types.  A level-type
	    defines it's own dungeon-generation, which monsters and objects
	    may be found and other characteristica.  The town-level in Vanilla
	    angband is such a special, or themed, level.  Langband is
	    structured to make it easy to add your own levels and choose for
	    your variant what kind of levels are to be created when. </p>

	  <p>A variant may also define it's own room-types, which may be
	    vaults, shop-rooms, churches, elven courts, dragon's den, etc.
	    This code has not been fully expanded yet, but it should have the
	    same customisability as a level.  A level-type may also define
	    which rooms may be generated for that level. </p>

	  <p>Another useful global dynamical variable is the
	    <code>*DUNGEON*</code> object, which is the technical
	    representation of the current level.  It may also be found by
	    using the accessor <code>(LEVEL.DUNGEON *LEVEL*)</code>.</p>

	  <p>
	    Currently very little is documented or in place, some coding
	    guidelines exist however to make the code easier to understand:

	  <ul>

	    <li>All code should be lowercase whenever possible despite
	      uppercase names in documents.  The uppercase is used to make the
	      code stand out in the text, but code doesn't need to stand out
	      in code.</li>
	    
	    <li> All constants (<code>DEFCONSTANT</code>) are put in-between
	      <code>+</code>-signs, ie <code>+pi+</code> </li>

	    <li> All global dynamic variables (use <code>DEFVAR</code>, not
	      <code>DEFPARAMETER</code>) are put in-between <code>*</code>-signs,
	      ie <code>*player*</code></li> 
	    
	    <li> All predicates have a <code>?</code>-suffix, ie
	      <code>player-dead?</code> and should have no side-effects</li>
	    
	    <li> All functions which induce side-effects on their arguments should
	      have a <code>!</code>-suffix, ie <code>equip-player!</code></li>
	    
	    <li> All functions which manipulate global variables should have a
	      <code>&</code>-suffix, ie <code>init-environment&</code></li>

	    <li> Functions that are meant to be internal to their file and
	      not be used outside or exported should use a <code>%</code> prefix.
	      Ane example is <code>%birth-input-char</code> in
	      <tt>birth.lisp</tt> which is only input to birth-functionality
	      and is uninteresting to others. </li>
	    
	    <li> All game-related symbolic constants should be put between
	      <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, ie
	      <code>'&lt;RANGER&gt;</code></li> 
	    
	    <li> All functions and macros with a <code>DEFINE-</code> prefix
	      implicitly have global side-effects, ie
	      <code>define-monster</code>.  They will also return the object
	      they have defined.  Do not use the <code>&amp;</code>
	      suffix. </li> 
	    
	    <li> The prefix <code>MAKE-</code> are restricted to
	      non-sideeffect constructors of objects, ie wrapped
	      <code>MAKE-INSTANCE</code>s. An object is returned from this
	      kind of function.</li> 

	    <li> Functions whose purpose is to "add" something to "global" tables, maybe
	      from a <code>DEFINE-</code> function/macro, should use the
	      <code>ESTABLISH-</code> prefix, and return the object in
	      question.  A <code>&amp;</code> suffix is expected. These should
	      not be called by variant code though, variants should use
	      <code>DEFINE-</code>. However, if it seems reasonable with a
	      <code>SETF</code>-match to a <code>GET-</code> function instead
	      of an <code>ESTABLISH-</code>, use <code>SETF</code>.</li>
	    
	    <li> Macros which create an environment to execute code in
	      whould use a <code>WITH-</code> prefix, and if it needs a
	      function to implement itself it should use a
	      <code>INVOKE-ON-</code> prefix.  An example is:
	      <code>WITH-DUNGEON</code> and it's implementation in
	      <code>INVOKE-ON-DUNGEON</code>.  These macros are allowed to
	      create side-effects on their arguments. </li>
	    
	    <li> Variant-code should use their own special prefix for
	      internal functions, variables, etc.  As an example, all vanilla functions
	      and variables use the <code>VAN-</code> prefix.  Loading
	      variant-code is also allowed to induce side-effects, ie
	      registering the variant in appropriate places.</li>
	    
	    <li> Code which is expected to be common to all variants should
	      be put in lib/common and have a <code>COMMON-</code> prefix.
	      Loading lib/common might also have side-effects.</li>
	    
	    <li>Identifiers should preferrably be lowercase strings.</li>

	    <li>Functions which need interactive input might want to have a
	      <code>QUERY-</code> prefix. </li>

	    <li>Factory-methods, with no side-effects (except maybe caching)
	      and which require no interactivity, should use the
	      <code>PRODUCE-</code> prefix.  Factory-methods should when
	      possible depend on at least the variant, to be able to control
	      it. </li>

	    Typically a lisp-program would use symbols for this, but

	    For some code it is useful to be identified by a symbol,

	  <h2>Compatibility with ordinary Angband code-base</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	    Most of the code is derived from Vanilla Angband 2.9.0 and many
	    of the function names are taken directly from the Vanilla-code
	    but some are changed and more will be changed as things
	    progresses and Langband finds its own system to do things in.
	    <b>You should not expect Angband-ways of doing things to work.</b> 
	  </p>

	  <p> You should be aware that some of the terminology has also
	    been changed, e.g where angband talks about level for objects
	    and monsters, Langband talks about depth, reserving level for
	    a 'power-level' use, not dungeon-level it is found. </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Important simple changes is that all Angband underscores are now
	    hyphens, and that the code relies very little on global
	    variables (ie dungeon tables, player object, etc).  Other
	    changes may be found in the style guidelines.
	  </p>

    <ol type=i>
      <li> <b>What is Langband?</b><br>
	Langband is a rewrite of the traditional/vanilla version of
	Angband.  It is based on version 2.9.0 but will be upgraded to
	2.9.x at a later stage.  Langband is written in Common Lisp,
	which will allow me to combine the dynamic nature of easy
	scripting with good compiler technology providing an
	environment that allows a very high level of customisation and
	the necessary speed.</li>

      <li> <b>Where can I download it?</b><br>
	It isn't finished yet and won't be finished for some time as
	it will need go to through several stages, as all newly
	written programs must.  I hope to have a minimal playable
	version ready in October 2000 though.  A decent version will
	be ready 1st quarter of 2001 I presume. </li>

      <li> <b>Does it run on [insert OS]?</b><br>
	The main development-platform is my x86 Debian-system,
	using CMU Common Lisp.  It is also tested once in awhile with
	Allegro Common Lisp.  It should be portable to other
	OSes and other Lisp-systems at later stages though.  However,
	I might sacrifice support for older systems in order to get
	the best possible result with newer systems, e.g ditch the
	Athena-widget support to concentrate on Gtk+.  Gtk+ currently
	do not work with CMU CL.</li>

    <h1 align=center>LAngband FAQ</h1>

    <ol type=i>
      <li> <b>What is Langband?</b><br>
	Langband is a rewrite of the traditional/vanilla version of
	Angband.  It is based on version 2.9.0 but will be upgraded to
	2.9.x at a later stage.  Langband is written in Common Lisp,
	which will allow me to combine the dynamic nature of easy
	scripting with good compiler technology providing an
	environment that allows a very high level of customisation and
	the necessary speed.  It is a toy project which I work on when
	I find time, and the development-pace reflects this.  However,
	even if it is a toy-project, I try to write quality-code and
	have a good design.  This also ensures that it will take more
	time than the usual Angband-variant.</li>

      <li> <b>Where can I download it?</b><br>
	It isn't finished yet and won't be finished for some time as
	it will need go to through several stages, as all newly
	written programs must.  I hope to have a minimal playable
	version ready in the 1st quarter of 2001.  You can check it
	out from CVS or download pre-alpha versions on Sourceforge
	though. </li>

      <li> <b>Does it run on [insert OS]?</b><br>
	The main development-platform is my x86 Debian-system,
	using CMU Common Lisp.  It is also tested once in awhile with
	Allegro Common Lisp.  It should be portable to other
	OSes and other Lisp-systems at later stages though.  However,
	I might sacrifice support for older systems in order to get
	the best possible result with newer systems, e.g ditch the
	Athena-widget support to concentrate on Gtk+.  Gtk+ currently
	do not work with CMU CL.</li>

      <li> <b>I found a bug, what do I do?</b><br>
	Please check if the bug has been reported first in the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=6938">Sourceforge
	bug-tracking</a>.  If it is not reported, please try to
	describe what caused the crash, include any messages printed
	before the crash, and if you were dumped into the
	lisp-debugger please include a backtrace.  This is
	accomplished in CMUCL with the command 'backtrace' and in ACL
	with the command ':zo'.  These commands work in the
	debugger.</li>
      
      <li> <b>How can I see if a bug is fixed?</b><br>
	A reported bug will be marked as FIXED when it is fixed and
	the updated code has been put in the CVS-tree.  It will be
	marked as CLOSED when a new release have been made where the
	bug is fixed.  If you reported the bug, you will be mailed
	whenever there is an update on the bug.<br>
	BTW: If you have extra
	information on a non-fixed bug, please add it.</li>

      <li> <b>CMUCL freezes in lib/compat/obj-kind.lisp, or?</b><br>
	It just takes a really really long time to compile in CMUCL,
	several minutes.  This file is for compatibility with
	traditional angband and isn't really needed when the necessary
	files have been converted to lisp.  Please be patient. </li>
      
      <li> <b>How is the code structured?</b><br>
	Currently the code is changed frequently and this answer may
	not be up-to-date.  Please look at the <a
	href="tech.html">Technical description</a> for an hopefully
	updated description.</li> 

      <li> <b>The code in CVS crashes/does not work, why?</b><br>
	The code in CVS is development code, and might not even
	compile, and much less work.  Please use releases if you want
	things to "work".  The CVS-version is bleeding edge though and
	may have bug-fixes and features missing in releases.</li>

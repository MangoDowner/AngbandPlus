	      <h1 align=center>Release: Lepton (v0.1)</h1>

	      <p> The Lepton-release is the first non-developer relase, but it is
		a concept-release.  That means "See, this concept works and is on
		the right track, and now we're picking up steam."  It is not meant
		to be a complete playable version, it's a v0.1 release that shows
		that the project is alive and has realisable plans to reach a
		goal. </p> 

	      <p> The Lepton-release will show that basic features of the goal
		of an engine that supports pluggable angband-variants are
		implemented or implementable.  It will not have all features, nor
		all features fully implemented.</p>


	      <p>The v0.1 release has many of the most used commands
	      and functionality.  Focus has been on the most important
	      and most used functions, and those you meet early in the
	      game.  Some basic principles in development: </p>
	      <ul>
		<li> Focus on objects and monsters found before 1000' and their abilities
		  and powers. </li>
		<li> No fancy features, e.g visuals. </li>
		<li> No extended features when a simpler solution
		  exists, e.g no point-based stat-system, but simple
		  autoroller, and no haggling, but fixed prices. </li>
		<li> Don't implement features not strictly needed, e.g target-code,
		  hitpoints-warnings, ...</li>
	      </ul>

	      <h3>Things that are included</h3>
	      <ul>
		<li>Most commands (eat, drop, drink, pick up, read,
		zap wand, ...). 
		<li>Basic fighting and basic spells
		<li>Most common objects with effects
		<li>Doors, traps, corridors and rooms in the dungeon
		<li>Graphical tiles for X11, *including* <a
		href="screenshots.html">images</a> (which is not 
		in any other angband variant)
		<li>Aggressive monsters and nasty combat attacks by
		monsters.
		<li>Bows, wands, staves and rods and a fireball for
		your enemies.
		<li> Simple stores, a simple home and quick to create
		a character.
		  
	      </ul>
		  
	      
	      <b>Things that will not be included:</b>
	      <ul>
		<li> vaults or pits
		<li> artifacts
		<li> monster-powers commonly found below 1000' (some exceptions)
		<li> object-powers commonly found below 1000' (some exceptions)
		<li> spellbooks below 1000' (some exceptions)
		<li> store restock, restricted buy in shops
		<li> day/night in town
		<li> integrated room-code
		<li> ego-effects of below 1000'
		<li> monster use items or monsters pick up items
		<li> no monster-memory
		<li> perfect descriptions or perfect screens
		<li> character-dumps to text-files
		<li> a 'D'estroy command
		<li> targeting, running or resting commands
		<li> no point-based birth or haggling
		<li> refill of lamps or spiking of doors
		<li> perfect division of jobs between variant-code and
		engine
		<li> fully integrated event-code
		<li> home in town is not saved, also some other
		missing features in save/load
	      </ul>

	      
	      <p>Quickly summed up, this means that a lot of things
	      still need to be added and improved.  I hope I'll be able to do
	      this, but some help would be appreciated.</p>

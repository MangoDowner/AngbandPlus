    <p>
      Some thought are mentioned in the <a href="plans.html">(Langband
      plans)</a> document but I thought I'd write up some of my ideas
      for the variant I want in order to not forget them when I'll
      eventually need them.  This document is not available by normal
      links but some clever chaps might find it still though.
    </p>

    <p>
      Contraband is a variant where things take place near a small
border town.  The town, 


      DLAngband is of course just a D tagged onto Langband making a DL
      (Dragonlance) *band.  The Middle-Earth setting is a bit too
      restrictive for my changes I guess, and I wish to move things
      slightly more in another direction w/o the same old monsters.
      Krynn does not have orcs, so they disappear easily.  And
      artifacts will become more of a mixed blessing as they will
      have ego and will not always be dictated by Joe Player. 
    </p>

    
    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>I'll extend the list from the plans-document:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> (Edible) corpses.  This is also important because some
      Krynnish creatures have weird effects when they die, and
      collecting corpse-parts for magical experiments and for quests
      might be useful.  "Bring me the whiskers of a dragon, young one!"</li>
      
      <li> Monsters carrying and <u>using</u> relevant items.  If the
      kobold picks up Wyrmslayer he will use it.  Yes, this implies that
      the "monsters can't pick up artifacts" disappear. </li>
      
      <li> Part of making things DL is to create another milieu, and
      themed rooms and "dungeons" are essential.  The dungeon-theme
      also lends itself well to dwarven constructs and mines which
      will be interesting.  Introducing shops might be too nethackish,
      but how about traders traveling the dungeon? </li>
      
      <li> Krynn also has it's special races (kenders, draconians,
      shadowpeople, tinker gnomes...) and classes (handlers, wizards
      of high sorcery, ...) .  One of the classes are of course the
      Knights of Solamnia, and they need quests so worthy quests must
      be added.  This will also be a nice feature for mages and
      priests as well who may also be given quests.  Quests should
      span over several levels and involve items and hunts for
      particular creatures.  The lesser quests, with a random amount
      of monsters, found in e.g [Z] is not a good option.</li>
      
      <li> Gods and religions for priests (and others).  Attitude to
      life will also be important for a paladin, knight and priest and
      if an artifact will accept you as an owner. </li>

      <li> New weapons do of course include hoopaks, dragonlances and
      mage staffs as real weapons.  These staffs should have spells
      and hidden powers.  The classic staffs in angband disappear
      though and are replaced by staffs that can be used as weapons
      for mages and priests (depending on incliniation).</li>
      
      <li> Special [L] features will be added.  There will be Knights
      of the Lambda Calculus in the game and of course some squires. </li>
      
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Other nice ideas which may not be compatible</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> lay-on-hands for paladins
      <li> skill-system (at least a limited one)
      <li> more realistic dungeon with ordinary objects like barrels
      of food, tables, chairs, ...
      <li> conical breaths
      <li> separate throwing and bow-skill
      <li> ...
    </ul>

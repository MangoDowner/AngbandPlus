<p>Many names and few explanations but I hope this will clear up.</p>


<h3>Starting letter</h3>

<table border=1 width=500>
  <tr><td bgcolor="khaki">
    To _ _ _ _ _,<br><br>

    <p> Congratulations on being appointed Imperial Agent, I hear you
    have impressed your trainers.  After the sudden death of King Aequus in the
    Kingdom of Atrocitas, the Empire of Copia needs to intensify the information
    gathering about what happens in Atrocitas.  Because you have
    impressed us in every area, and you've asked for a "real mission",
    we will send you to the border areas where a lot of
    travelers and merchants from Atrocitas pass.</p>

    <p> You have received two sealed letters.  One of them is to be
    delivered to Imperial Mereo Ulydes in Bartertown, and he will give
    you further assignments.  The other letter must be delivered to
    Imperial Mereo Junifer in Mont Renuo (Lambda Rock), and she will
    have further assignments for you.  Remember to titulate Mereo
    Junifer as General, and not as Mereo.</p>

    In Bartertown you should also seek out a man named Procedo
    Quovis.  Agent Quovis has three fingers on his left hand and will
    ask you for your business.  You will tell him that you're a former
    textile trader with an interest in the copper trade.  During this
    mission you will report to Agent Quovis.</p>
    
    <p> Treat these people with respect and try to remain anonymous in Mont
    Renuo and Bartertown.  You are a former textile trader (try to learn
    some of the trade while on the way to Bartertown), but lost your
    shop and have little money left and you're looking for a business
    to succeed in.  However, the Imperial Agency will provide you with two
    hundred silver florentins, a generous amount of money by any
    standard.  This should be more than enough to get you
    started.  Nothing would be better than if you had a running business
    in either Bartertown or Mont Renuo to hide your real errand.  Do
    not under any circumstances reveal your identity as an imperial
    agent to anyone not mentioned in this letter.  If you are pressed
    for information you're just a former textile trader trying to make
    a living.</p>

    <p> As an Imperial Agent you have no special privileges and any
    crimes you're caught for will be punished by the local
    government.  The Agency will not interfere with the local
    government's right to punish criminals.  It is therefore of utmost
    importance that you are careful and maintain your secret
    identity.  The Agency reserves the right to punish you for crimes
    against the Empire's interests in addition to what local
    government and other branches of the Empire finds appropriate.</p>

    <p> The Most Holy Emperor Sapient wishes you all luck and hopes that you will
    uncover more of what happens in Atrocitas.  Information about
    what's happening in Bartertown and Mont Renuo is also of great
    importance to us.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Kingdom of Atrocitas</h3>
<p>
One week ago the venerable King Aequus of the mighty Kingdom of
Atrocitas died in his capital Atrobürg.  King Aequus is credited for
ending a forty years long war between the ambitious and evergrowing
Empire of Copia and the Kingdom of Atrocitas. King Aequus brought his
people a long-lasting peace with the Empire of Copia, and ensured the
survival of the peace during his reign.  Trade has flourished,
enriching both countries and both states have ambassadors and consuls
working in the other state.</p>

<p>King Aequus left three sons behind, all in their 40s, and all of
them mighty and powerful princes.  There is a definite risk of various
power factions in the kingdom wanting their prince to be king so badly
that a civil war is the result.  And a civil war in the Kingdom of
Atrocitas may spill into neighbouring countries or even make Atrocitas
so weak that it may be conquered with ease.  So neighbouring countries
need information badly on the situation.</p>


<p>  The oldest son,
Prince Adaugeo, was early committed to the service of the Church of
Deus Salveo, and has traveled all across the empire building
hospitals, fixing sanitation systems and recruiting new adepts and
even doctors for Deus Salveus service.  Prince Adaugeo and his
knights are heroes of the people, loved by even atheists.  He has been
a major critic of the merchants and nobles for hoarding riches and
excessive spending on luxury, instead of helping the needy.  Prince
Adauego also started a successful missionary program for Deus Salveo,
recruiting hundreds of young priests, eager to spread the word in the
heathen Empire of Copia.  The missionary program has caused
aggravation in the churches in the Empire of Copia, and the Empire's
priests have found that attacks on the missionaries is a real problem as
they're also trained as fighters as well as healers.  The Imperial
Church of Edex Bellica has called for Imperial Troops to oust the
troublemaking missionaries. The merchant guild in Copia remains very
skeptical to limits on trade by the do-gooder priestly prince.  In
particular his priests have supposedly destroyed caravans with
Imperial Wine and the Bluestar Berries. </p>

<p>The middle son, Prince Vehemen was always the favourite of the royal
household with his eloquent manners, his mastery of the blade and the
horse, and his excellent leadership skills.  He did not take long to
attract a sizable knightly order consisting of only the bravest,
brightest and strong noblemen of the kingdom.  Through wars on the
north front fighting the Dakau Dogmen, his knights and the infantry have
conquered large amounts land, mines and gold which has strengthen the
Atrocitan economy.  Rumours of intense cruelty by the knights towards
enemies have reached the capital Atrobürg, but has been dismissed
because these are the noblest men in the kingdom respected by all.
There are also rumours of the knights conquering a tower of dark magic
and now use the powerful weapons and magical treasures they found
there. </p>

<p>The younger son, Prince Callidus never had the religious fervour of
his oldest brother nor the knightly aura or skills of Vehemen. So while his
brothers were out "saving the world" the way they could, he spent time
with his father learning diplomacy, strategy, politics, understanding
people and learning how to run an empire.  Through his own trading
company he has also made an immense fortune. He has also worked hard
to drive Copia's merchants out of business in Atrocitas, by buying up
wares from local dealers and then selling the wares inside Copia at a
trading post called Bartertown.  Merchants who want wares from
Atrocitas have practically been forced out by Callidus and his
alliances.  The Copia merchant guild is more or less in open war with
Callidus and other Atrocitas traders and raids on caravans have been
common.  Prince Callidus has little support in the population but his
network among the elite and among wealthy merchants is immense. </p>


<p> It's uncertain what relations are between the princes themselves
and if they are willing to risk a civil war.  The Empire of Copia is in a difficult
position as it does not want to meddle in the situation, but wants
up-to-date information on the candidates' future plans if they win, where they
get support from and the empire wants to indirectly support the best
man for the job. </p>

<h3>Bartertown and Mont Renuo</h3>

<p>Contraband is a variant where things take place near two trading towns
in the Empire of Copia.  The western town, Bartertown, is placed on the
most important traderoute between the capital of Copia, Copia Diuturn,
and the Kingdom of Atrocitas in the east.  Bartertown lies on the
western side of the river Ovid which also links the north and south of
Copia, and as such has grown into a very important trading post.
Bartertown was established by merchants and traders a century ago to
avoid the strict trade regulations of the town Mont Renuo.  Mont Renuo
lies on the eastern shore of the river Ovid, and is also the eastern
border against the Kingdom of Atrocitas.  Mont Renuo is also involved
in the trade, but most merchants prefer Bartertown where their guild
runs things. </p>

<p>The minstrels of the Empire are crafters of amazing tales and songs,
but never underestimate the importance of the tales the many merchants
tell in their travels.  And tales of the "creepy" and "dangerous" Mont
Renuo have been popular all over the empire for decades and
centuries, and citizens are likely to believe any story they hear.
What remains a fact is that Mont Renuo has remained fairly independent of imperial 
influence and most imperial guilds have failed in establishing a presence
here.  Mont Renuo has held back Atrocitan aggression the last
few centuries, and a strong Imperial fort lies just south of the town.</p>

<p>Bartertown is a bustling imperial town where every imperial citizen
would feel at home.  It is governed by Mereo Ulydes and he has a
relaxed attitude to things, allowing the merchant guild to control
it's own members.  Mereo Ulydes is perceived in the capital as too
lax, but Bartertown generates so much money for the imperial tax
coffers that nobody wants to upset the situation.  Atrocitan merchants
are treated fair in Bartertown, but often complain about the merchant
guild cooperating on prices.  Many atrocitan merchants prefer to trade
in what they perceive as "a more neutral and fair" Mont Renuo.  The
Atrocitan Consul in Bartertown is the old diplomat Tepesco, who is
rumoured to have participated in forming the peace treaty between the
Empire of Copia and the Kingdom of Atrocitas.</p>

<p>Mont Renuo is dominated by a small mountain just north of town, and it
is what gives the town it's name.  On top of the small mountain is a
tower, but ordinary folks dare not go there as it is shrouded in nasty
myths and legends.  The town itself is not built in imperial style
with broad streets for troops to parade in, but has small streets and
many small alleys.  The lack of open spaces might make imperial citizens
feel insecure and merchants claim the alleys of Lambda Rock are filled
with thieves and assassins.  As a border town it has also a more
varied population than most other towns, and Lambda Rock has a lot
more atrocitan merchants, travelers and even a temple to one of the
atrocitan gods Deus Salveus.  Tradition holds that the commander of
the Imperial Fort of Mont Renuo is also Governor of Mont Renuo. The
commander of the fort is General Junifer whose prime concern is to
keep the border safe and ensure the safety of traders, both imperial
and atrocitan.  In the capital General Junifer is perceived as a
brilliant general who cares about defense, battles and her soldiers,
but little for the governorship or the city itself and can get hostile
if referred to as Mereo Junifer.  She lets her loyal Captain Perpetro
handle all governor tasks. </p>


<h3>Rumours about Mont Renuo</h3>

<p>Rumours abound about Mont Renuo or Lambda Rock, and few people knows
today what is truth and what is not anymore.  The independence of
Lambda Rock, the tower on the mountain, how it has turned away
atrocitan forces and how it became an imperial town have all
contributed to the rumours.  Some of the more persistant rumours:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Mont Renuo is really ruled by a mighty sorceress who live in
  the tower.  Her name is uncertain but some claim it is Maria, others
  think it is Helena.  Some claim she has become an undead monster
  while other say she gets magical potions from the elves to further
  her miserable existence.</li>
  
  <li> The sorceress supposedly destroyed more than five thousand
  atrocitan soldiers in a battle three centuries ago, saving the whole
  empire.  After that she said she felt tired and allowed an imperial
  fort, got Lambda Rock (which was the old name) included in the
  empire and for the city to be called Mont Renuo.</li>

  <li> Others claim that there is no sorceress and that the empire
  invaded the town three centuries ago and built a fort to hold the
  river Ovid.  But as with many other border towns under military
  control it remained a bit different, and the military kept the
  merchants out.</li>

  <li> Others claim that Lambda Rock is named after a knightly order,
  the Lambda Knights who controlled the town and river for
  centuries and used a magical forge inside the mountain to create
  their weapons.  This knightly order held the Kingdom of Atrocitas
  back for a long time, but eventually the order became too weak and
  the imperial troops moved in.  The first troops who entered the
  tower got killed by powerful traps and magical beasts, and since
  then the tower has been left alone.</li>

  <li> Other claim that the Lambda Knights still exist
  and use the tower for their magical experiments.  Rumours of strange
  townsfolk buying many lambs during late summer as gifts to the
  knights and for sacrifice are also common.  The lambs the townsfolk
  buy disappear within days of purchase.</li>

  <li> Others claim that a magical order called the Lambda
  Elementalists control the town and keep the atrocitans out.</li>

  <li> Most people seem to agree that the atrocitans are constantly
  looking for a way to destroy Lambda Rock and the fort.  Some people
  claim that if Lambda Rock falls the entire empire will fall.</li>

  <li> A small group of Edex Bellica priests have lately claimed that
  the atrocitan heathens are sending powerful magicians and Deus
  Salveus priests to the Lambda Rock tower to steal magical weapons
  and possibly to destroy the magical forces protecting the town.
  Merchants say that the Edex Bellica priests are just war mongering. </li>
</ul>  

<h3>Mythology</h3>

<p>People in both the Empire of Copia and the Kingdom of Atrocitas worship several
gods, and sometimes the gods are remarkably similar between the countries.  There are no
supreme gods, and the gods' powers seem to be related to the number
and power of the worshippers.  The Copians usually put an Edex in
front of the names of their gods as titles, and the Atrocitans use
Deus as title for their gods.</p>

<p>The gods seldom play an active part in events, except through pious
followers that can pray for magical powers.  Some gods are known to
grant powers to heal the wounded and sick, others are known to provide
their followers with unnatural combat abilities and others are known
for powers to control weather and plants.  The priests' powers are
seldom, if ever, flashy or directly damaging to others.  As such the
gods have limited influence of events that happen, compared to the big
armies of the kingdom and the empire.</p>

<b>Known gods in the Empire of Copia</b>:
<ul>
  <li> Edex Bellica - the revered god of the mighty Copian armies and
  of the mighty warrior-priests of the Empire.  Edex Bellica is often
  depicted as a young and ambitious captain on the field, a good
  strategist but joins his men in the battle.  The priests see
  conquest as the best way to honour Edex Bellica.</li>

  <li> Edex Mine - the sister of Edex Bellica and the one who makes
  Edex Bellica's armour, weapons, catapults, wagons and all the other
  crafts needed to wage wars and run a powerful empire.  Her priests
  are expert craftsmen known for creating powerful magical
  weapons.</li>

  <li> Edex Florentin - no Copian trader starts the day without
  blessing Edex Florentin, the patron god of all commerce and the one
  who has made the Copian Empire the richest in the known world.  The
  Copian currency is named after Edex Florentin, and all merchant
  contracts are sworn to be just and honest to Edex Florentin.  The
  priests of Edex Florentin are master economists and serve in all
  parts of the guilds and the government.</li>

  <li> ... </li>
</ul>
  

<h3>Races of the known world</h3>

<p> The known world seen from the Empire of Copian are dominated by
men, and few other races have managed to survive the wars the Empire
have led against them.  To the north in Dakau, a land of hills and
mountains, the mighty dogmen still hold off the Empire's troops.
Dogmen are seen as invariably evil in the Empire and every dogman head
delivered to a Mereo's office will give the proud hunter a bounty of
25 florentins. </p>

<p> Many many centuries ago, the elves of the forests dominated
Copia, but they were slowly driven back by an aggressive and warlike
Empire.  After years of skirmishes the elves finally gathered a large
army.  The elven army was beaten at Perseco, and the elven priest
Heimgyr was forced to sign a "peace" treaty on behalf of the elven
people.  The treaty gave the elves a few small and scattered areas
where they could live untouched by the Empire, and gave the rest of
the land to the Empire.  The elves were allowed to travel in the
empire to trade, but never in larger groups than ten.  Elves are
roughly 4 feet tall and have pale green skin.  They are a
very uncommon sight in the cities, but their ability to shape wood and
leather far surpasses that of humans. </p>

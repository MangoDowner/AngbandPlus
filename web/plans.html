    <h1 align=center>LAngband plans</h1>
    
    <p>
      I have not written a lot of the rationale and purpose behind
      Langband.  This document will at least some features I want and
      how I imagine this implemented.  
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation plans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Small and pretty generic game engine with as few as
      possible special cases.  Details should in most cases be moved
      to variant-specific code. </li>
      
      <li> Allowing the variant to be programmed declarative and let
      the engine build the necessary datastructures.  Allow use of
      object-oriented and functional/procedural code in the variant to
      be intermingled with the declarative code, ie callback
      functions, local variables and classes, overriding of
      engine-features, etc.  The variant will have the full power of
      Common Lisp available.</li>
      
      <li> Limit the amount of constants in the game, and let most
      things be tailoured and customised in the variant-code. </li>

      <li> Strive towards a human-readable and intuitive mini-language
      to describe the variant in.  </li>

      <li> Have a conversion-tool for a one-way translation of
      standard Angband info-files to the Langband variant
      mini-language. </li>

      <li> Avoid hacks and too complex features of standard Angband,
      ie the macro-language and the myriad of unused options. 
      
      <li> Use Vanilla as a variant-template for others to build their
      variants from.</li>

      <li> Make the Lisp-code portable between
      Lisp-implementations.</li> 
      
    </ul>

    <h2>A variant which use the Langband engine</h2>

    <p>I plan to use the Langband engine to build a variant of my own
    which will probably have the following features:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> (Edible) Corpses</li>
      
      <li> Monsters carrying and <u>using</u> relevant items.  If the
      kobold picks up Cubragol he will use it.  Yes, this implies that
      the "monsters can't pick up artifacts" disappear. </li>
      
      <li> Get rid of the stupid pits and instead add "themed" rooms
      as orc camp, giant lair, dragon council, elven courts,
      graveyards, ... </li>
      
      <li> Divide level feelings into separate parts, not sure on
      details yet though.  Make feelings dependent on race, class and
      level, and a chance to botch feeling perception.  This will
      <u>weaken</u> the current level feeling system considerably, see
      also next point wrt to "special levels" in non-preserve mode.
      The level feeling system now hardly ever is meaningful except
      before 1000'.</li>
      
      <li> Remove point-based character generation, non-maximise mode and the
      non-preserve mode.  Also strip away several other options. The
      removal of non-preserve mode also means that "special level"
      feelings disappear.  Auto-scum might also be removed and levels
      in general will be made more interesting.  Auto-scum is mainly
      used to get interesting levels now.  This change may also be put
      directly into the engine though. </li>
      
      <li> Connected stairs to avoid stair-scumming and make it
      realistic when one recalls and go back stairs. </li>
      
      <li> More realistic equipment organisation and add containers
      like quivers and backpacks. </li>
      
      <li> Different kinds of spellbooks, which can have random
      spells.  Spellbooks can also have free spots to transcribe one
      spell from one book to another.  </li>
      
      <li> Quests which span over several levels and involve items and
      hunts for particular creatures. </li>
      
      <li> Gods and religions for priests (and others). </li>
      
      <li> Possibility for making a team, but unlike Tangband the
      whole team should be placed in the @ and moved around together
      and the characters should be shown on the left in eye of the
      beholder-style to make it easy to visualise whose turn it is.
      This should be default, but with the possibility of spreading
      out in really bad fights.</li>
      
      <li> Add better music support, and find appropriate music.  When
      entering the Big Church (themed room) Schubert's Ave Maria
      should be played.  When entering the dungeon for the first time,
      Repulica's Ready to Go should be played.  Or maybe not :-)</li>
      <li> ... </li>
    </ul>

13-11-2001 Unangband 0.4.4 "Lost Legends"
- Lots of changes lost because I had my laptop stolen :( Lesson. Back
up to ftp when you are doing stuff (The Linus backup technique).
- Lost changes (Just to make you guys sick): Another 600-700 monsters.
Another 200-300 items. Updates to Unangband to include to JLE 2.9.3
patch. Work on Unangband borg. Implementation of some of what I did
on todo list on web site (And discovered a lot of it doesn't add to
game play much). Two weapon combat (Easy enough to reimplement).
- Stuff I lost that annoys me: Bug fixes.
- Decided to change direction. Rather than running off and creating 
a full fledged varient, I will maintain Unangband pretty much in its
current form, but continue to update it to match the latest version of
Angband.
- I will wait until Angband 2.9.4 comes out before updating however,
as I want the random artifact code and big screen patches.
- However, I don't want scripting (At this stage). So I'll probably
roll back lua changes.
- Will try and get feature flag code and item memory code into main
tree as these are the two most wide ranging changes (From a code
point of view), and will create the most work for me to keep updating.
They are also most 'value-add' to Angband as far as I can tell.
- I suspect item memory code will be 'impossible' because of lua
changes however.
- I'll consider proposing to Oangband guys to work on incorporating
Unangband features into Oangband code base. This varient seems to
be the most progressive in terms of maintaining play balance while
improving the game.
- If I could I'd spend as much time developing as Dark God and friends
and come out with the full fledged varient with wilderness, allies,
quests etc. But I can't (At least not until I retire in 50+ years).
Sorry guys.
ACTUAL CHANGES CONTINUE FROM HERE:
- Made Druids get Magic Missle at level 1.
- Changed it so that the smart monster spell selection randomly
resolves tie breakers.
- Made warriors of all types get 1 extra blow at level 1 in their
speciality (Except missile weapons, who get 1 extra shot),
as well as rangers, paladins and archers. Non-specialists always
get an extra blow (or shot for archers).
- Made druids get icky weapon penalties, when not using
their preferred weapon, or when otherwise specialised.
- Made bards only get icky hands if instrument.
- Made thieves of all types get 1 extra critical at level 1 in their
speciality. Non-specialists always get this benefit.
- Added object information and room description to save files.
- Added 2.9.4-alpha version of the JLE artifact and ego item patches,
including addition of Slay Evil to Defender weapons.
- If you want to dust off any pre 2.9.2 Angband save files, this version
should be (mostly) compatible. Ego items will be a problem in some
instances (Boots/cloaks/shields particularly).
- Ego items memory guesses one ability/sustain/resist abilities now,
and hackily always knows what items do not have xtra abilities.
- Objects such as blades of chaos don't taint ego item memory.
- Ego item and artifact memory should be retained from game to game.
- Allow DROP_GOOD monsters to drop deep scrolls and potions.
- Require ego items dropped by DROP_GREAT monsters to have at least
a minimum level of 1, or minimum 1000 gp cost.
- Modify the depths of ego items to provide a smoother power curve.

27-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.3 "Final Fantasy fix"
- Modify store mass produce cost limits to allow multiple scrolls of
identify scrolls to be created in stores. Some minor fiddling with scroll
costs (Identify/Detect Magic/Curse cheaper, Remove curse slightly more
expensive). However, we reduce the numbers of low cost stock generated.
This may make scrolls of phase door (Probably the most useful of the
low cost items) harder to stockpile. Also has effect of making enchant
scrolls and cure critical wounds easier to stockpile. But high level
priests could already max out their weapons... so this shouldn't be
hugely unbalancing and probably beneficial for warriors.
- Brought back staff of perceptions... at level 45.
- Should have tracked down most if not all missing locations in code for
object info being updated.
- Swapped location of books of Transformations and Destruction.
- You don't get experience now for monsters killed in traps, as this
was open to much abuse. (Reported by Franklin Bratcher).
- Fixed stupid loop resulting from confused monster trying to cast a
spell (Reported by Eytan Zweig).
- Changed book styles so that player receives bonus for spell if it
appears in their style book even if they are casting it from 
another book. This should help many specialists at low level.
- New spells now will display info when browsing or selecting, if
relevant.
- Changed book styles so that the player also can cast spells some
levels lower if the spell is in their book style, so that many styles
eg of Power, of Lore, are actually useful now. This may be unbalancing
in some instances (ie create gold at level 36), note however that
the mana costs remain unchanged.
- There were user interface issues with listing spells once you learnt
your 33rd spell, which have been fixed (Reported by Christopher Pollard)
- The same bug was preventing studying of more than 33 spells.
(Reported by Christopher Pollard)
- Unimplemented spells should now be illegible.
- Blessing/prayer/chant provides temporary hold life.
- Fixed bug where heroism/beserk strength would mark equipment as having
resist fear.
- Add notifications for detecting flags when wielding/shooting/meleeing
with an object.
- Fix last known crasher due to an uninitialised variable (Reported
by Sean Lester).
- Removed low mana warning until we implement an option for this
(Reported by Franklin Bratcher).

25-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.2 "Magic Mushroom fix"
- Added object info. This tries to be smart about what we notice from hitting
monsters and attack effects on us, and notifies the player in instances where
an object must provide a particular power.
- Also hackily sets up some obvious flags for the player.
- Also hackily gives timed information on some less obvious flags for the
player. This is silently done, and requires that the player swap equipment
around, and retain the older stuff.
- Also provides hit/dam/ac information after an object has been used at least
500 times (This value may be too low).
- Also hackily identifies an object after it has been used a lot
(At least 20000 times).

24-07-2001
- Currently, some stateful information about monster hidden/over is not
recorded in the save file. This needs to be corrected.
- Added mushrooms of mana which restore 2d5 mana when eaten. (Suggested on
newsgroup).
- Mushroom patches now drop mushrooms 'appropriate' to the patch type. As
a result, all cursed mushrooms have a predictable flavour. This can be
disabled via a pre-compile option.
- And we finally implement drops for Farmer Maggot's dogs... a small
kindness for mages. Note also now, a wand of clone monsters is useful for
farming magic mushroom patches...
- Instruments can be sold in stores.
- Some minor tidy up of monsters.
- Due to sign reversal, we were never confusing/scaring/slowing the player
when monsters cast spells.
- Gave druids magic missile, so they can be playable at lower levels.

23-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.1 Feature and bugfix release
- Walking onto an invisible trap at level 0 would infinitely loop, never
finding a trap. Now we force trap selection at level 3, if in town.
- Actually make most melee/shooting styles work proper (Logic and flag errors).
- Make climbing/flying monsters ignore terrain damage.
- Get spore spells working, and make wail spells like gazes instead of spits.
- Detect magic/curse now senses all items it detects, as opposed to just items
in inventory. It will probably need to be balanced out some more (Comments
welcome).
- Added superb (Ego items with xtra powers), great (15+ combined to hit and
damage, or 9+ AC), and very good (9+ combined to hit and damage or 5+ AC)
feelings for detect magic/heavy inventory sensing. Superb isn't working at
the moment however, will need to debug.
- Monsters with pass wall now can hide in all terrain they can resist.
- Player will be notified if a visible monster hides, or if a monster
emerges from hiding to become visible
- Rods of dowsing do something.
- Fixed summon specifics for various changes in monster char types.
- Add CAN_FLY to some killer beetles.
- Make sure we only see descriptions while looking if we have already seen
room.
- Remove rods and rings from room descriptions. Change sooty rooms to have
flasks of oil, instead of torches.
- Made general store sell first 2 songbooks.
- Bards should hold songs now.
- Changed way id styles work so that aware items can be sold at correct
prices.
- Added more thief, warrior, paladin styles. Moved some rogue styles to
mage and added other mage styles.
- Walk through hidden monsters rather than attack them.

19-07-2001 0.4.0c Bugfix release
- Quartz and magma power was 10 too high in f_info.txt (Reported by Leon
Marrick).
- Made identify scrolls appear earlier in dungeon, and slightly cheaper
(Requested by Leon Marrick). Also made Detect Magic scrolls cheaper. This
may change again once object id code goes in.
- Referencing wrong flags for checking to drop items, resulted in items
frequently disappearing (Reported by Leon Marrick).
- Running was not checking the right way for instances when touching some
walls. (Reported by Leon Marrick).

18-07-2001
- Made a great number of features more commonly available as well as modified
a number of them.
- Thieves accidentally started with really bad stealth. Fixed.
- Monsters were never climbing or flying.
- Backstab now works against fleeing monsters. Criticals from styles do not
work against non-living opponents.

18-07-2001 0.4.0b Bugfix release
- Angband was generating 9 monsters for every call to vault monster. Changed
this to 1, but allowing a monster of up to 5 levels out of depth now.
- Notified the player if they are dealing with a hidden monster.
- Fixed many problems with room descriptions, particularly initialisation.


17-07-2001 0.4.0a Bugfix release
- Because I changed the logic of hitting traps and finding secrets to
fix some bugs before releasing 0.4.0, I (mildly) broke some functionality.
Walking on a SECRET damaging terrain would not discover the secret, although
the description was displayed. This is now fixed.
- Gave smart monsters a chance of disarming traps equal to the chance of
breaking glyphs. This is for free, and so they don't 'waste' their time
trying to disarm traps.
- Fixed it so monsters were actually hit by traps and features (Logic bug
in code).
- Fixed it so invisible trapped doors could activate a trap.
- Allowed monsters to hit invisible traps and trapped doors. They must pick
a trapped door so they don't get stuck in the door. We hackily allow
out of knowledge invisible floor traps to not be activated.
- Made trails more trail like... and inform the player if they travel through
dusty locations.
- Forget locations that become boring...
- Made features scatter around a room more.
- Had describe room in the wrong place in the lighting code. Comes of adding
a feature at the last minute and not testing (See above).
- Fixed weird mana bug problem, and restricted spells learnable in a more
clear manner. You will now think you can learn spells even if a book is not
available for you to do so (This is probably a regression).
- Made much more stuff climbable for monsters.

16-07-2001 Unangband 0.4.0 "Mystery" release aka "War against the Angels"
aka "Angry Young Man"

- Massive changes implemented.
- c_info.txt and w_info.txt added, which allows definition of classes.
- 4 new classes added: archers, thieves, druids and bards.
- All classes have styles (sub-classes) added. These add additional
abilities defined in the w_info.txt at the cost of 10% additional
experience. See birth.c for details. This effectively means over 100
classes.
- 130 new spells added. (Summon spells not implemented yet).
- 5 new prayer books, 17 new spell books, and song books for bards added.
- Bards continue to sing songs after being cast.
- Instruments created for bard (musicians).
- Context sensitive help (Needs help file to be editted).
- over 500 new creatures added.
- 230 room descriptions added. See d_info.txt for details.
- Significant debugging and changes to feature code.
- Fixed some game killer bugs. Running and looking work.
- Game is definitely playable now.

10-04-2001
- Conversion completed to 2.9.1. Actually less dramatic than the time
difference here suggests, mostly due to interruption by a production of
'King Lear' (Great play), and other Real Life (tm). Needs to be tested
and verified that all code ported across correctly.
- Tidied up f_info.txt to 2.9.1. Modified readme.txt.
- Picked up additional bugs in code base.

07-11-2000
- Conversion begun to 2.9.1 code base
- Throwing now applies damage as melee and missile weapons
- Fixed bug in some project paths not using new flags
- Spiking now uses easy open option

04-11-2000
- Monsters/traps now confuse/hold/blind/slow other monsters using the
monster level or the trap power, not the same value as the player (Which
was meaningless).
- Features destroyed by fire/acid/cold only if damage is greater than
10*feature power now.
- Fleeing monsters get pushed past, and push past other monsters, unless
they are confused or KILL_BODY
- Monsters stealing objects now flee instead of blinking. Because of the
other changes, they should get further away now.
- Theft traps no longer leak an object. They drop the item on the ground
near the player or lose it completely.

03-11-2000
- Monsters can cast innate spells while confused, but will randomly target
locations around them.
- Monsters will attack other monsters while confused.
- Monsters can now target other monsters with their spells but should only
do so while confused.
- Monsters can cast spells while out of line of sight.
- Reduced maximum number of monsters in groups from 32 to 8.
- Various tidy ups with feature code.


19-11-2000
- Removed icy water of various types as this was indistinguishable from water
and didn't cause much damage. Still need to clean up code as a result.
- Removed damage from geothermal and icy floors. These just hint that there
(may) be creatures swimming underneath now.
- Made ice transparent and cause ice damage (rather than cold) and act as a
trap (So tunnelling damages, but standing on does not)
- Added various ice features to support transparent ice.
- Removed ATTR_LITE flag (as not used frequently) and seperated MOVE and PROJECT

18-11-2000
- Continued debugging and tidying up of features
- Make chasms always have an edge, except for bridges over the chasm

09-11-2000
- Fixed problem with duplicate messages occuring because of bugs in hit_trap.
- Fixed some bugs in run/look.
- Fixed F_INFO.TXT file to include POWER_X when relevent.

06-11-2000
- Fixed bugs with feature implementation and generation.
- Added drowning in deep features.

05-11-2000
- Added extra feature blow methods and effects required to support remaining
features
- Added descriptions for all GF_ attacks to monster memory
- Allowed SPORE, SPIT, GAZE, WAIL spells, which apply monster blows of that
type at a distance, either via ball, bolt or LOS
- Replaced ARROW_X spells with a single SHOOT spell, which applys monster blows
of type SHOOT at a distance

04-11-2000
- Updated changes.txt file.
- Started todo.txt file.
- Started future.txt file. We list high priority easy fix stuff in the todo.txt
file, and save lower priority cool stuff for this file.
- Started bugs.txt file to document known bugs that have not been resolved.
Bugs are listed seperately from todo.txt.

Changes before 04-11-2000  UnAngband 0.1.0 "Blackbelt" release
- Created new f_info.txt file format with numerous changes documented in that
file. The majority of changes are implemented in init1.c and/or code. See
bugs.txt and todo.txt for incomplete/buggy components.
- Changed majority of code to use flags and other new entries in f_info
required for f_into.txt. This is a widespread change and is not completed yet.
- Created numerous new features, including new traps, trapped doors, water,
lava, ice, acid. This change is too big to mention here, and the philosophy
behind it (And the particular meanings of the flags) is best discussed in the
f_info.txt file. The emphasis is on terrain that will correctly overlap each
other, and is usefully interacted with by monsters and the player. We also
pick stuff that makes (the most) sense in an underground setting, with
increasing risk as the player gets lower in the dungeon.
- Changed generate.c to generate features, emphasising simple terrain
generation algorithms over complex, hard to understand or define stuff. Note
that this still needs lots of balancing/testing to get right, perhaps by
increasing the overall size of the dungeon.
- Changed RBE_ data types to GF_ data types and implemented in init1.c,
spells1.c and melee1.c. We can define monsters that attack with any possible
GF_ type now, and they use the project_p code to attack the player. This will
allow lots of funky stuff in the future, and makes implementing traps a lot
easier.
- Changed smart monster spell selection to always pick the highest damage
attack against a player for SMART monsters, and more likely for not-STUPID
monsters. This encourages monsters to learn resistance against their primary
attack first, and then drop to potentially less powerful attacks. However,
it makes smart monsters really smart in their attack selection. This should
be offset by decreased overall monster damage, otherwise the player will get
killed very quickly.
- Changed melee attacks against monsters to be decreased by monster armour,
much in the same way as monster attacks against the player are reduced. This
is part of an overall effort to make monster/player combat symetrical.
- Scaled monster hit points down by the same factor. This should give spells
more effect against monsters, while decreasing the overall effectiveness of
breath weapons except for very high hit point monsters. We scale this during 
- Changed missile attacks to use the same damage algorithm as melee attacks
rather than multiplying slays/brands after adding bonuses. This should be
offset by the scaling down of monster hit points in most instances, as we
still don't count armour for missile attacks (Similiarly to what monsters do).

Changes in Angband 2.9.1v2:
-Fixed a bug that allowed the player to gain info about unidentified
 items.
-Changed the default color definition of "light red" so that it doesn't
 look so similiar to "red".

- Entry into debug, wizard, or borg mode is only confirmed once per
  character, not once per session.
- The debug command 'e' now allows current and maximum experience to be
  altered.
- Boldor, Gabriel, Khamul, Murazor, Tselukas, Draebor, Hoarmurath,
  Thuringwethil, Omarax, Qlzqqlzuup, and Feagwath can now summon similar
  monsters.
- Master quylthulg, Emperor Quylthulg, Qlzqqlzuup, Murazor, Pazuzu,
  Lungorthin, Gothmog, Sauron, and Morgoth can now summon greater demons.
- Ancalagon the Black can now breath fire.

  levels 99 and 100.
- Fixed a bug in the "know complete monster info" cheat option.

Compilation changes:
- Added a compile.txt file with compile guides for various systems and
  compilers.
- Added a makefile for the free Borland C++ 5.5 compiler.
- Removed lots of compiler warnings.
- Fixed a problem when compiling Angband on newer (glibc-based) Linux
  systems.

- Added support for the use of the 8x8 and 16x16 tiles in the X11
  version.

Windows specific changes:
- You can select between the "old" tiles, the new tiles, and ASCII mode.
- The Windows version no longer requires changes to angband.ini when
  installing.  The angband.ini file will be created when you first start
  the program, so it doesn't need to be present in the binary archive.
  That also allows easy updates to newer versions, since the settings
  in the angband.ini are not overwritten when installing a new version
  over an old one.
- The windows can be resized and the (graphical) tiles will adjust
  automatically to the new size.
- Added the "Show scores" command to the menu.
- Fixed a bug that created all files as "read-only" (causing the game to
  fail when saving the game).
- Fixed a bug that caused all numbers to be registered twice by the game,
  leading to "double-steps".
- Fixed a bug that didn't free the used bitmaps correctly when closing
  the game.

DOS-specific changes:
- Graphics, sounds, and music options
  You can switch the graphics/music/sound options from the user menu
  (press ! to get there).  The volume of the sound and the music can be
  adjusted from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  All changes to the screen-resolution
  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.
- Sound Events
  DOS-Angband will play samples from the "lib/xtra/sound" folder to the
  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.  Multiple sounds per event are
  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').

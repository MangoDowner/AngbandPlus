DrAngband Changes:
------------------

DrAngband 2.9.7 (Jan 2001)
---------------------------

* Reduced the fail rates on detection spells some.  They failed too often.

* Repaired bugs to randart rings,

* Repaired the Ethereal Lock spell so that it works.

* Breath weapons are now arcs.

* Pixies can now be Wizards.

* Fixed the 'monster light out of sync' bug.

* Monsters take poison, just as deadly as player poion

* Crown of Dragonkind too nice, added aggravation to it.

* Increased the value of Invisibility by decreasing the number of monsters
  who posses SEE_INVIS.

* Monsters breath at Invisible players, at least in their direction.

* Pixies also get racial power of phase door.

---------------------------

* Monsters may carry light and illuminate the dungeon.

* Rogues and Rangers get an automatic critical hit against sleeping foes.

* Added the Priest Spell of Ethereal Lock.  It prevents all forms of teleport
  and summoning.  No one enters the battle, no one leaves. :)

* Fractal Attacks.  You will attack an adjacent monster until all your
  attacks are used up.

* Damage from poison toned down.  It was much too deadly before.

DrAngband 2.9.5 (10/2/2000)
---------------------------

^^ Above changes after beta release.
------------------------------------

* Globe of Resilience reduces damage to 2/3.

* *Massive* changes to mage spellbooks. Mage class renamed to wizard.

* Almost nothing is immune to confusion, sleep and slowing.

* Destruction no longer destroys everything. Sometimes
  creates rubble.

* project() code from oangband: Arc spells.

* Wands/staves and rods of various types (confusion, sleep,
  slow monster) rarer since the effect is more powerful.

  doors.

DrAngband 2.9.3 (28/11/99)
--------------------------

* More changes to Multi-hued dragons. They now get acid,
  elec, fire and cold resist from the start and gain
  double resistances and poison as before. Marginal stat
  improvements. Don't want to overshoot their rebalancing.

  +3 INT and better saving throw for Copper Dragons.
  Copper and Bronze dragon colours switched.

* Updated version of fractal caves patch (sfpatch5.tar.gz),
  with random vaults!

  version 2.9.2). Also made cheaper.

  will do an automated note of experience, level, depth,
  gold, etc.

* Lightsources reorganised.

* Unix/Curses & X11 (main-gcu.c and main-x11.c) 50-line support.

* Fixed nasty bug in mushrooms of poison.

DrAngband 2.9.2 (18/11/99)
--------------------------

* Added racial gold adjust for multi-hued dragons.

* Removed EASY_KNOW from rings of ice, flames and lightning. Depth
  decreased, rarity increased so warriors can activate them more easily.

* 'Balancing' changes to dragon races:
  Copper dragons now get double disenchantment resistance at level 40.
  Crystal dragons get double shard resistance at level 40.
  Bronze dragons get double confustion resistance at level 40.
  Brass dragons get double sound resistance at level 40.
  Fixed their racial power.
  Multi-hued dragons have a higher exp penalty, slighly lower stats,
  lower DEX, INT and WIS and only reach double resistance. Hopefully they
  will be less overpowered now!
  Multi-hued dragons: Resistance to poison at level 45.
  Considerably redesigned multi-hued dragon racial powers.

* Amulets of resistance.

* Amulets of Invisibility are much deeper now.

* New town layout [startup] option. The new town layout is defined in
  t_info.txt. Currently only one the normal [vanilla] and one single
  new layout are supported. In future many more may be available.

* Fixed some bugs in the application of rng offers. You may now enter the
  town after offering an item without losing the object level bonus. The
  autoscummer no longer causes problems, either.

* Monsters resistant to electricity are no longer stunned by it.

* Renamed 'Brass' dragons to Gold dragons.

* Earthquake kills monsters stuck in walls [Tim Baker].

* Player ghosts as they were in DrAngband 2.0.

* Cloaks of Free Action.

* Ring of speed depth and rarity changed.

* Some alterations to the way RNG bribery is handled.

* Updated main-emx.c and makefile.emx files for OS/2 support.

* Low dragon scale mails given shallower depth.
  PDSM given confusion.

* Warriors made better with magical items.

* Dragon Scale Mails recharge *much* quicker.

* Amulets of the magi INT bonuses reduced.

* Invisibility sucess now dependent on player stealth.

* Bone files only deleted when the ghost is slain. Kind of like preserve
  mode for ghosts.

* Player ghosts given various other nasty powers... New flavours of dragon
  ghosts.

* Electricity stuns the player. Meteors damage walls.

* Greater basilisks.

* Steven Fuerst's fractal caves patch!

* Experimental 50 line support. Allows the cave to be displayed
  over larger screens. Set with -b switch.

* Many changes to make use of new screen space. 

* More dangerous poison.

* Fixed identify_fully when used on stuff with many attributes.

* Special feeling now given in non-preserve mode.

* Lousy RNG offers are penalised.

* Resistance to poison no longer makes you immune to the effects
  of poison. Cure poison made rarer on various types of healing.

* Support for 50 line mode in OS/2 (main-emx.c) and -b switch
  now takes number of lines (Alexey Guzeev).

DrAngband 2.9.1 (2/11/99)
-------------------------

* TM_CURSE upgraded to every 50 turns and nastified in other ways...

* Dragons get extra +hit and +dam bonuses.

* Invulnerability now halves damage. Name changed.

* No 100% safety from theft.

* Yeek racial power 'flee in terror' (Haste 5+d5, terror 5+d10).
  Pixie racial power 'throw pixie dust' (confuse monster).

* Other racial powers fail rate lowered.

* The One Ring Activation more powerful. Given invisibility, too.

* New artifact crown for dragons. It is TM_CURSED when used by non-dragons.

* Dragon's teeth and claws correctly shown in character dumps.

* Staves, wands and rods more powerful.

* Mages are useless with bows. Wands should be their bows.

* Rings of Confusion resistance (mostly for dragons).

* Invisibility shown as '*' in see_invis field.

* Mage spells 'Mana Bolt' and 'Resist Electricity'.

* [Some] Orcs can fire arrows. (Monster) Archery attacks marginally boosted.

* Resist light & dark on shadow cloaks.

* Bonus to digging for dragons.

* 'Amulet s' bug fixed.

* Default options saving feature.

* Keymap dump bug fixed.

* Chests usually drop good items.

* Detect doors now detects locked and jammed doors.

* Multi-hued Dragons: 4 basic resists, single, double, treble and quadruple
  resisted at levels 0, 25, 35 and 45 respectively.

* Race name now no longer overflows onto dungeon map with big names.

* Dragon attack message order corrected (Bite, Claw, Bite, Claw, ...)

* New main-gcu.c. (Whose?)

* Weapon skills: Stabbing, fencing, hafted and polearms. Implementation
  is transparent. Compare hobbit rogues using daggers with using maces
  or axes for a good example of the effects of this. Also priests with
  edged weapons or polearms.

* Priest -2 to hit,dam when using edged or polearms removed because the
  new weapon skills penalise *far* more realistically.

* Ring of Speed rarity and depth changed to prevent mid-game boredom.

* Fixed curse armour scrolls so they trash dragon's cloaks and not their
  first ring.

* Actual object quality boost to next level when offering stuff to the RNG!
  This can result in objects up to 40 levels out of depth when making
  particularly generous offerings.

* Fixed a 'bug' in the fake artifact names patch caused by over-running
  the normal 80 byte buffer.

* Faster ranger psuedo-id.

DrAngband 2.9.0c (28/10/99) [Not released]
---------------------------

* 'O' is now 'Use racial power' on the rogulike keyset. Still 'U' on the normal
  one.

* ^O (Ctrl-O) is now 'Offer item to the RNG' on the roguelike. Still 'O' on the
  normal one.

DrAngband 2.9.0b (27/10/99)
---------------------------

* Fixed major bug in staff and wand stacking.


Angband 2.8.3 -> DrAngband 2.9.0 (Started 24/10/99)
---------------------------------------------------

* Player invisibility. INVIS (equipment) and SEE_INVIS (monster) flags added.
  (TR3_INVIS, RF2_SEE_INVIS).

* Artifact Arrows. 'Bard' and 'Hellblazer'.

* 25% breakage of arrows (from 50%).

* Immunities shown as *, temp resists shown as #.

* Amulets of the Magi now give intelligence instead of searching and a random
  high resistance.

* 1 Extra shot at level 30 for Warriors with any ranged weapons.

* Extra shots at levels 20 and 40 for Rogues with slings.

* Rings of poison resistance to depth 2000', rarity 3, value 12000 (from depth
  3000', rarity 2, value 16000).

* 'Elemental' rings activate for double resistance. Ring of Acid changed to
  Ring of Lightning.

* Globe of Invulnerability now only reduces damage (that reaches take_hit())
  to 1/3. Eg mana storm = 550hps / 3 = 183hps with the new globe.

* New TM_CURSE. Based on the TY_CURSE. It has a  1/TM_CURSE_CHANCE (100) chance
  of activation each turn. Effects range from draining experience and stats
  to summoning multiple ancient dragons, high undead, demons and uniques.
 
* Iron Helm of Gorlim, Two Handed Sword 'Mormegil' and weapons of morgul have
  gained the TM_CURSE.

* Leon Marrick's Oangband Rod stacking. Rod recharge times moved to pval field
  of k_info.txt.

* [Monster] Dragon melee damage massively increased.

* get_rnd_line() borrowed from Zangband.

* 'O' command offers items to the Random Number God (RNG). Note -- Artifacts can
   be offered and will disappear permenently if offered.
   Rng.txt, rng0-5.txt have the RNG responses.

* 4th spell book 'Genocide' spell changed to 'Plasma Storm', a 5 * plev damage
  radius 3 plasma ball. Level 37, cost 23 mana.

* Raal's Tomes spells considerably powered up.

* 'Fake' Artifact names can be created by inscribing items with #<artifact name>.
  Eg Longsword (2d5) (+9,+9) inscribed with @w0#'Ringil' will appear as
  a Longsword 'Ringil' (2d5) (+9,+9) {@w0}. This is a nice feature so you can
  name your non-artifacts (although it does work on artifacts. eg "The Glaive
  of Pain 'Tomthanc'".)

* OPT_testing_stack, OPT_testing_carry and OPT_alert_hitpoint options now on
  be default.

* Resist chaos no longer gives hidden resistance to confusion. All artifacts that
  previously gave resistance to chaos now give proper resistance to confusion also.

* Resistances accumulate. 

* All the old DrAngband races.

* Rings of sustaining and resistance.

* Dragon racial powers activated with 'U'. Code borrowed from Zangband.

* Priest spell 'Detect Traps' changed to 'Spiritual Hammer' and 'Detect Doors/Stairs'
  changed to 'Detect Doors/Traps' (although it also detects stairs.)

* Nice new powers give to *slay* ego items.

* Monsters from Drangband 2.0 (from zangband).

* Slays applied to total melee damage. Slays smaller for melee than for
  ranged attacks.

* "Show player by race" option to show dragons as Ds. Best used with "hilite
  player with the cursor" so you always know which D is you!



Changes from Angband 2.7.8b2 to old Drangband versions
------------------------------------------------------

Added new character races: 

Pixies (- str,con + dex,int +10speed, confusion attack)
Yeeks  (-5 to everything, but advance quickly)
Crystal Dragons (res shards, free action, shard bolt, extra +25 AC)
Copper Dragons (res dis, freeact, regen, dis ray)
Bronze Dragons (res conf, regen, conf bolt)
Brass Dragons (res sound, regen, stun bolt, BAD stealth!!!)
Psuedo Dragons (res light,dark,blind, regen, light ray)

All dragons also get resist fear and featherfall, a bonus to AC, can dig 
and fight without weapons, and instead of normal equipment carry an amulet, 
six rings, a light, a cloak, and a crown. They also (in general) have bad
stealth and horrible CHA, and (non-dragon) shopkeepers hate them.

Breath weapons and Pixilate use 'P'.

Deleted the mage spell of cure poison, and the priest spells of detect doors
and detect traps. Added mage spells cone of cold, lightning bolt (old lb
renamed to spark), wall of fire, ray of force, and resist lightning. Changed
spell damages. Added priest spells detect doors/traps and spiritual hammer.

Added about 40 new monsters.

Added rings of resistance and rings of sustaining.

Added a few empty mineral veins

Fixed a nasty artifact bug. I think.

------
Changes from Drangband 2.0

Changed hp/spells/mana per level to use tenth points rather than half points.

Added my favorite little Golden Retrievers. :)

Added resist poison to the list of higher resists, and feather fall to lower.

Added random higher resists to amulets of the magi. Added resist poison to 
Defenders. Added fire immunity to Slay Demon. Added possible stat bonuses to 
the other crappy ego-weapons.

Changed the roguelike key for breath weapons to 'O' (so it can actually be 
used).

Extended the blows table to give 7 or 8 attacks for VERY high str/dex.

- Removed icy water of various types as this was indistinguishable from water
and didn't cause much damage. Still need to clean up code as a result.
- Removed damage from geothermal and icy floors. These just hint that there
(may) be creatures swimming underneath now.
- Made ice transparent and cause ice damage (rather than cold) and act as a
trap (So tunnelling damages, but standing on does not)
- Added various ice features to support transparent ice.
- Removed ATTR_LITE flag (as not used frequently) and seperated MOVE and PROJECT

18-11-2000
- Continued debugging and tidying up of features
- Make chasms always have an edge, except for bridges over the chasm

09-11-2000
- Fixed problem with duplicate messages occuring because of bugs in hit_trap.
- Fixed some bugs in run/look.
- Fixed F_INFO.TXT file to include POWER_X when relevent.

06-11-2000
- Fixed bugs with feature implementation and generation.
- Added drowning in deep features.

05-11-2000
- Added extra feature blow methods and effects required to support remaining features
- Added descriptions for all GF_ attacks to monster memory
- Allowed SPORE, SPIT, GAZE, WAIL spells, which apply monster blows of that type at a distance, either via ball, bolt or LOS

04-11-2000
- Updated changes.txt file.
- Started todo.txt file.
- Started future.txt file. We list high priority easy fix stuff in the todo.txt file, and save lower priority cool stuff for this file.
- Started bugs.txt file to document known bugs that have not been resolved. Bugs are listed seperately from todo.txt.

Changes before 04-11-2000
- Created new f_info.txt file format with numerous changes documented in that file. The majority of changes are 	implemented in init1.c and/or code. See bugs.txt and todo.txt for incomplete/buggy components.
- Changed majority of code to use flags and other new entries in f_info required for f_into.txt. This is a widespread change 
and is not completed yet.
- Created numerous new features, including new traps, trapped doors, water, lava, ice, acid. This change is too big to mention here, and the philosophy behind it (And the particular meanings of the flags) is best discussed in the f_info.txt file. The emphasis is on terrain that will correctly overlap each other, and is usefully interacted with by monsters and the player. We also pick stuff that makes (the most) sense in an underground setting, with increasing risk as the player gets lower in the dungeon.
- Changed generate.c to generate features, emphasising simple terrain generation algorithms over complex, hard to understand or define stuff. Note that this still needs lots of balancing/testing to get right, perhaps by increasing the overall size of the dungeon.
- Changed RBE_ data types to GF_ data types and implemented in init1.c, spells1.c and melee1.c. We can define monsters that attack with any possible GF_ type now, and they use the project_p code to attack the player. This will allow lots of funky stuff in the future, and makes implementing traps a lot easier.
- Changed smart monster spell selection to always pick the highest damage attack against a player for SMART monsters, and more likely for not-STUPID monsters. This encourages monsters to learn resistance against their primary attack first, and then drop to potentially less powerful attacks. However, it makes smart monsters really smart in their attack selection. This should be offset by decreased overall monster damage, otherwise the player will get killed very quickly.
- Changed melee attacks against monsters to be decreased by monster armour, much in the same way as monster attacks against the player are reduced. This is part of an overall effort to make monster/player combat symetrical.
- Scaled monster hit points down by the same factor. This should give spells more effect against monsters, while decreasing the overall effectiveness of breath weapons except for very high hit point monsters. We scale this during 
- Changed missile attacks to use the same damage algorithm as melee attacks rather than multiplying slays/brands after adding bonuses. This should be offset by the scaling down of monster hit points in most instances, as we still don't count armour for missile attacks (Similiarly to what monsters do).

- At character creation, some extra difficulty options are
  available (no artifacts, no stores, no up stairs/recall).

  now handled outside the normal inscription system, and so neither
  overwrite, nor are overwritten by, normal inscriptions.

  levels 99 and 100.

Compilation changes:
- Added a compile.txt file with compile guides for various systems and
  compilers.
- Added a makefile for the free Borland C++ 5.5 compiler.
- Removed lots of compiler warnings.
- Fixed a problem when compiling Angband on newer (glibc-based) Linux
  systems.
- Added a compile-time option to allow players to put an .angband.prf

- Added support for compiling a Linux SVGALIB version with graphics.
- Added support for the use of the 8x8 and 16x16 tiles in the X11
  version.

Windows specific changes:
- You can select between the "old" tiles, the new tiles, and ASCII mode.
- The Windows version no longer requires changes to angband.ini when
  installing.  The angband.ini file will be created when you first start
  the program, so it doesn't need to be present in the binary archive.
  That also allows easy updates to newer versions, since the settings
  in the angband.ini are not overwritten when installing a new version
  over an old one.
- The windows can be resized and the (graphical) tiles will adjust
  automatically to the new size.
- Added the "Show scores" command to the menu.
- Fixed a bug that created all files as "read-only" (causing the game to
  fail when saving the game).
- Fixed a bug that caused all numbers to be registered twice by the game,
  leading to "double-steps".
- Fixed a bug that didn't free the used bitmaps correctly when closing
  the game.

DOS-specific changes:
- Graphics, sounds, and music options
  You can switch the graphics/music/sound options from the user menu
  (press ! to get there).  The volume of the sound and the music can be
  adjusted from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  All changes to the screen-resolution
  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.
- Sound Events
  DOS-Angband will play samples from the "lib/xtra/sound" folder to the
  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.  Multiple sounds per event are
  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').

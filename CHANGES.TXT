Unangband 0.5.1 "'Oops. I did it again' again" release
- Reordered monsters in monster file, rendering save file
incompatible for the first time ever since Unangband released.
However, it allows use of graphics in the game, using Angband
2.9.6 pref files.
- Fixed bug with loading dungeon in campaign mode.
- Fixed bug causing visual weirdness due to tab replacement
in strings.
- Fixed bug preventing players learning spells that was
introduced in upgrade to 2.9.6.
- Fixed some minor monster changes.


Unangband 0.5.0 "This is Dedicated" release
- Updated help files to include new options.
- Restructured help files to format similar to Eyangband.
- Removed a number of monster AI options that are no longer
used.
- Made it so players descending to ground floor of tower, gets
placed inside the tower.
- Use revised knowledge code from Eyangband.
- Change auto-inscription code to use the revised knowledge
code (~) instead of the old auto-inscription menus ($). In
particular, you can (c)opy and (p)aste auto-inscriptions,
letting you very quickly configure large number of auto-
inscriptions in a manner similar to many auto-squeltch
implementations. (No "squeltching by quality" supported though).
- You can now inscribe @x* on an item, where 'x' is any action,
and that item will always be picked when you attempt to perform
that action. This is very useful in 2 circumstances: when you
want to duplicate the {SQUELTCH} inscription from many other
variants, by setting up auto-inscriptions with @k*, and when
you only have 1 stack of arrows/bolts, shots inscribed with @f*,
saves you a keypress to fire.

- Scrolls of teleport level had incorrect s_info.txt entry
(Should have been 10).
- Made frogs slightly deeper and all toads spit at a distance.
- Loose rocks not working properly because of paranoia.
- Make metallic centipedes metallic.
- Enchant armor and enchant armor to-resist had incorrect
s_info entrys (should be 16 and 49).
- Mushroom of mana has incorrect s_info.txt entry (Should
be 20).
- Improved curing from Cure Light/Serious/Cure Critical/Cure
Mortal Wounds.
- All goblins should be HURT_LITE.
- Wooden chests only drop gold (At this depth, it is more
valuable than garbage).
- Broken cages should be MOVE and not TUNNEL.

Unangband 0.4.9h Bugfix release
- Fixed spelling of Caradhras.
- Caradhras, the Mountain now guards Caradhras.
- Some other dragon flies were accidentally green. (Reported
by Sean Lester).
- Fixed various bugs with wands.
- Added 34 additional wands.
- Made wand/staff charges depend on object level rather
than sval type.
- Removed old changes information, as this was taking a lot
of space.
- Brought back old high resistance shields/body armor.
- Changed town monster types in Bree and Rivendell.
- Rods of Lightning were doing fire damage by mistake.
- Now only apply song effects if we have a significant
energy use.
- Metallic monsters should shimmer a lot more frequently.
- Was "fixing" rod timeout really badly in save file. Now
fixing it correctly. Rods will have a recharge time now.
- Added maps to various locations to allow non-campaign
mode players to journey to some campaign locations; also
to extend campaign mode by allowing some alternate dungeons.
- Made all trees lose FRIENDS flag. They're too tough at
their depth otherwise, and never looked good placed as
FRIENDS.
- Potions of infravision now work.
- Recall is really working now.
- Cancelling scrolls/staffs etc are really working now.
- HURT_ROCK monsters should now drop bodies.
- Staff of Detect curse now working.
- Spells were displaying description twice. Fixed.
- Bug accidentally marked people as winners after killing
quest monster at bottom of a dungeon. Fixed.
- Changed it so that you have to defeat the trolls
to make it to Rivendell.
- Ghosts/other passwall creatures now correctly hiding in
terrain again.
- Tidied up frog depths and renamed a duplicate frog.
- Changed monster visibility when outside to correctly
handle monsters travelling over buildings, also visibility
at nighttime. When you are outside, you can see any
flying/climbing monster during daytime, and any flying/
climbing monster at night that is lit by torch/lantern
light only. When you are inside, you cannot see any
monster that is outside (This is a hack).
- This should stop spurious hiding/emergence messages
that you get while you are outside.
- Also prevented player from attacking monsters on the roof
of a building while they are inside it, and vice versa.
- Note the above are all fairly ugly hacks to allow some
three-dimensional movement while on the surface (Actually
2 2d planes lying on top of each other).
- Fixed a number of problems with spells, that were
preventing many spell effects and items from working
properly.

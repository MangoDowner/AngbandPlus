More feedback -- Is there any way that the game could change the way
monsters look depending on if they are your pet?  Sometimes, when I
summon lots of orcs, I get them mixed up with "wild" orcs, and don't
notice I'm being attacked, or get confused which is mine and which
isn't.  Perhaps change the background color slightly for pets?

uav> ToDo -- good idea but very hard to implement.

Came across an apparent bug when receiving a quest reward for a hard quest.

Load the attached savefile and immediately go into the Guild house to 
collect the buggy reward.  And yes, it does show up the same way in the 
character notes afterwords.

This is NOT the reward I expected for killing 17 Wyverns... :/

Pets drop items. Deep in dungeon, any poor Ogre Shaman ends up surrounded 
by Greater Undead/Demon/Dragon, then some Balrog or Wyrm breathes chaos 
and anything breathed on polymorphs. After the Ogre Shaman and a few 
hundred polymorphed creatures are killed, the amount of loot is similar to 
a Wyrm pit.

If webs created in dark places are ripped apart,
the places are illuminated after this.

Companions do not level up properly, but convert to '@' and vanish
(sorry, I have no savefile on this)

uav> Couldn't reproduce.

Pets/companions don't fight monsters in walls.

Changes from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2:

- Not compatible with older savefiles. Sorry.

## General Changes ##

- Added new "easy mode", which considerably lowers monster HP, and gives better prices at 
  stores. You also start with an additional 500 GP. However, scores are reduced by 75%.

- The system for player attacks with "special" effects (confusing, blinding, etc.) has
  been totally redone; you can no longer affect monsters that are immune to the attack,
  and the player is notified of the effect, and missiles now will have the proper effects.
  Also, confusion attacks (from a scroll of monster confusion) no longer depend on the 
  player's level but rather on the amount of damage inflicted.

- Rangers now get spells from the third spellbook (Incantations and Illusions) 2 levels 
  later than before (i.e. Identify is now level 15).

- Modified critical hit rules:
  - Now you get a different critical hit effect based on weapon type. Swords, arrows and
    bolts now cause less damage upon a critical hit but will also induce bleeding. 
    Hafted weapons and shots cause less damage upon a critical hit but will also stun
    monsters, and on very good critical hits also sometimes confuse them.
  - The effect of critical hits now more level dependant (though not very significantly so).
  - Critical hits for shooting and throwing seperated. Neither is dependant on the weight
    of the missile anymore (since this difference was meaningless in the case of missiles
    and plain stupid in the case of thrown stuff - try throwing a dagger and a plate armour
    and see what gives you better hits).
  - Critical hits are somewhat affected by class - there is a new class flag 
    BETTER_CRITICAL which causes improved critical hits and is given to the warrior class. 
  - There's also a BETTER_SHOT flag which gives a similar improvement to missile criticals
    (given to rangers). 
  - Priests (and custom classes with the BLESSED_WEAPON flag) will never score a critical 
    hit with a non-blessed sharp weapon.

- Some levels may now be small, which means that they will take less than the full number
  of panels. Unlike in other variants, they are not optional, but relatively rare.
  (thanks to Joseph William Dixon for his assistance).

- New birth option - birth_force_small_level. Every level will be generated as a small 
  level. (note that a "small" level may still be full size, though very rarely)

- Destoryed levels slightly rarer.

- Potions of Detect Invisiblity now cheaper and sold at the alchemist.

- Rangers can no longer brand/enchant bolts - only arrows. 

## Item Changes ##

- Some swords changed for more variety: Long swords now do 2d6 base damage and worth
  slightly more money, Scimitars now weigh 9 pounds. Cutlasses now do 2d3 damage.
  Small swords completely removed. Some artifacts changed - sting is now a short sword,
  Gondricam now does 2d3 damage, Anguirel and Elvagil do 2d6, Haradekket now weighs 9
  pounds. 

- New ammo types: Spiked Bullet (heavy sling ammo), Biting Arrow (better damage, but 95%
  of breaking), Tough Arrow (heavier, more expensive than normal, but only 10% of breaking),
  Bite Bolt (as biter arrow).

- New SLAY_HUMANOID and SLAY_PERSON flags for weapons replacing the old SLAY_ORC, 
  SLAY_GIANT, SLAY_TROLL flags. New ego items of slay humanoid and slay person have 
  replaced the old items. New weapons of Carnage which have both flags. Many artifact 
  weapons changed to reflect the new flags. 

- Some artifact powers changed a bit.

- Changed the way the PVAL description works. Now, all possible effects have descriptions
  (i.e. +1 con), not just some of them. If an item has more than one pval-dependant flag,
  it just shows the plus (like HIDE_TYPE). As a result, HIDE_TYPE removed from all 
  artifacts and is now present only on some ego-items, rings and similar items to avoid  
  displays such as "Ring of strength (+1 str)".

- k_info.txt gains a new row - X:, which determines the quantity of items in a stack, and
  the chance that item will break when thrown/fired (both values were previously hardcoded,
  dependant on item type). Items with the X: row missing will act the same as before. Some
  items will now gain more appropriate quantities (especially food which will no longer 
  appear in such large quantities), and more appropriate breakage chances.

- Removed all junk items (empty bottles, broken sticks, shards of pottery, ruined chest).
  Also removed Hard Biscuits, Pints of Fine Ale and Pints of Fine Wine. The relative large
  amount of items added in this and previous versions made junk items redundant.

- Shooters of Extra-might display streamlined - instead of (for instance):
  Short bow of Extra Might (x2) (+1, +1) (+1), it will show:
  Short bow of Extra Might (x3) (+1, +1).  As a result, the multiplier will no longer 
  be shown on unidentified bows.

- Crowns of Wizardry easier to find.

- Ego weapons and ammo of slay plant are now more common. Ego weapons of slay nature made
  rarer as their old rarity was a bug.

## Monster changes ##

- New monsters: Dark quylthulg, Giant green louse, Nilbog Warrior, Nilbog Lord, Doom
  sword, Warping Fiend (from Gumband)

- New unique: Chun the Unavoidable.

- Ogre Cheiftains now gain escorts.

- Several creatures changed depths, rarities, and exp values to better match their powers,
  including a re-organization of most of the late uniques.

- The GIANT, TROLL, and ORC flags have been consolidated into a HUMANOID flag (which has
  also been given to some 'h' creatures). A new PERSON flag has been added for 'p' monsters
  and other 'h' monsters.

- Changed the way monster groups are generated. Monsters now usually generate groups only
  if OOD; as a result, all group monsters raised a few levels. FRIENDS now generates 
  larger groups than before. A FRIEND flag has been added which generates smaller groups.
  Note that FRIEND is non-cumulative with FRIENDS. Note also that the monster memory 
  description has changed from "it usually appears in a group" to "it usually appears with 
  other similar companions" or "many other similar companions" depending on the flag.

- To complete the previous change, group monsters all raised a few levels; monsters that
  had both a group and non-group version were turned into a single entry. 

- Changed the behavior of the ESCORT and ESCORTS flags; now, if you have ESCORTS, you no
  longer require ESCORT as well. As a result, the now redundant flag has been removed from
  all monsters.

- The CHAR_MULTI flag, which had no effect, removed.

## Bug fixes ##

- A majr bug with artifact generation was fixed that caused some artifacts (and other
  items) to behave weirdly, and the DONT_RANDOMIZE flag didn't work.

- Lord Voldemorte was being generated without escorts (because he had just ESCORTS but not
  ESCORT).

- Detect Enchantment will now properly detect magical lights.

Changes from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1:

## General Changes ##

- Graphic support now returned. 

- Objects knowledge list replaced by an item "browser" similar to the monster browser.

- You may no longer sell scrolls at the alchemist's.

- Minimum normal artifact index now determined in z_info.txt.

- Disenchantement resistance no longer completely nullifies DRAIN_ITEM, only significantly
  reduces its chances of striking.

- Player invisibility calculation changed and it is now slightly more effective for low
  stealth, and somewhat less effective at very high stealths. Also, monsters that can't
  see you less likely to summon creatures.

- Angels now get 50% EXP for non-evil creatures instead of just 33%

- Added new race - the Nilbog, which has great stats, and natural mana resistance, but 
  suffers from innate spell disruption and item draining. Basically, you'll
  only want to play a warrior with this.

- Added new treasure nests that contain only creeping coins. As a result, jelly nests are
  now rarer.

- The ranger spell "Enchant Arrows & Bolts" renamed "Sharpen Arrows & Bolts" to match its
  actual effect (turns ammo into ammo of wounding).

- Disease stat lowering will now disturb you if you are set to disturb when stat changes.

- You can now give characters ego items as starting equipment by modifying c_info.txt (due
  to player request).

- Monster experience no longer calculated by multiplying their EXP value by their level - 
  now the full value appears in their EXP level in r_info. r_info.txt changed appropriately.

## Item Changes ##

- Weapon damage plusses now related to weapon weight. Light weapons get lower pluses to
  damage than heavier ones. This also affects the max enchantement bonuses. Ego items can
  now always be enchanted beyond normal items of the same kind. Note that to-hit plus 
  range has not been affected.

- Added a new DISRUPT flag, which significantly raises spell failure rates.

- potions of life, *healing*, and healing and rods and staves of curing now cure disease.
  Pints of nectar shorten disease duration.

- The IMPACT flag is now limited to weapons.

- Added a new DONT_RANDOMIZE flag - artifacts with this flag will not be randomized
  if random artifacts are turned on. 

- Items with no distribution (A:) line in k_info will no longer appear in spoilers,
  squelch menus, or the object knowledge browser. To avoid problems, all food items may now
  appear in the dungeon, though the hard biscuits, beef jerky, pints of ale and pints of 
  wine are exceedingly rare.

- The INSTA_ART flag, having been made obsolete by the previous change, has been removed. 

- Amulets and Shields of unmagic now disrupt spellcasting.

- The artifact club 'Skullbasher' no longer provides a mana bonus. Instead, it disrupts
  spellcasting (this was a bug - it was always supposed to be bad for spellcasters).

- Amulets of invisibility made more expensive and deeper.

- Cloaks for Kings made considerably rarer.

- The Jeweled Crown of the Fallen Star made rarer.

- Rarities on several items tweaked - Musical instruments and some wands made slightly 
  rarer and/or deeper, while magical lanterns made shallower and more common.

- The PDSM 'Tortureskin' gained a new ability.

## Monster Changes ##

- Grip and Fang made slightly rarer.

- All wraiths (but not wights) and several uniques and other monsters gain SEE_INVIS.

- The group Gnome Mage has been replaced by the Gnome Mystic (still a group monster), with
  a slightly different spell list.

- The time fly is now light blue to match other time creatures, they are also more likely
  to cast spells/breath and are also worth less EXP as their previous value was too high.

- Cockatrices now move at normal speed.

- The Great Sentient Treasure made more powerful and now worth considerably more EXP.

- Blask-end Squerts now have more HP.

- Earth, air, water and fire spirits/elementals are no longer evil (the other elementals
  are as are the elemental uniques).

- Carcharoth, the Jaws incorporated into Cerberus, who now lurks on level 92; a new unique
  has been added for level 94 - The Behemoth.

- Giant fireflies now have the HAS_LITE flag.

## Bug fixes ##

- Corrected a potential out-of-bounds error with items that had too many distribution
  entires in k_info. 

- Item and artifact spoilers now list mana resistance on the correct items.

- Disease attacks will now properly be marked in the monster memory.

- The Necronomicon will now be properly generated.

- Fixed bug with redefining number keys (bug & fix inherited from Vanilla)

- Colours for canines now correct.

- Oils of burning properly removed when used.

- The base AC of artifact shadow cloaks has been fixed; The cloak of Orodreth now properly
  an elven cloak.

Changes from 0.1.4 to 0.2.0:

## General Changes ##

- Changed savefile format, to produce smaller savefiles. EyAngband 0.2.0 will NOT read 
  older savefiles.

- New class: The bard. The bard is a mediocre fighter, but he gets a whole new kind of 
  magic. Instead of learning and casting spells from spellbooks, the bard uses musical
  instruments. The bard has to wield a musical instrument in order to cast spells from it
  (the bard gets a special MUSIC slot that is unavilable to other classes). Each music 
  instrument has a plus ranging from +1 to +5. This plus is added to the bard's charisma,
  and in addition, it determines which spells the instrument offers. The bard does not
  have to learn spells - he can cast any spell that's available to his level and the level
  of his instrument. The bard's mana and fail rate are determined by his charisma.
  Musical instruments can be bought and sold at the general store, which only offers a 
  limited selection of +1 instruments - better instruments must be found in the dungeon
  (or black market). Finally, the bards get a special "lore" ability, which makes
  identify act as *identify* on artifacts for them (they have a command of history and
  legend and know all about the artifact from its name).

- Switched to using (a modified version of) the randart code from angband-a291. Names.txt
  is now a seperate file found in "libs\files".

- Added a disease status, which causes slow atrophy of the player's stats and slows 
  regeneration, and might cause temporary blindness or confusion.

- Character display changed - there is now a display of current "effects" (poisoned,
  blessed, etc.), the item properties page has been expanded for all the new flags,
  and a display has been added for current weapon flags. Also, in the item flag 
  display, a "*" column has been added which displays temporary effects ('+' for
  normal effect, '*' for immunity, and 'x' if it can combine with a permanent 
  resist for a double resistance).

- When looking/targetting monsters, you now get more useful descriptions of their current 
  condition ("wounded, afraid" instead of just "wounded", for instance).

- Monster behaviour when character is invisible changed - it will not prevent all 
  spellcasting if the character is unseen, just spells that affect the player. So 
  turning invisible won't stop a monster healing itself. 

- Monster conditions changed:
    - Uniques are no longer necessarily immune to confusion, sleep, fear, or stunning, 
      though they have a better chance of resisting.
    - "Stunned" monsters have a chance of moving/attack/or casting a spell. However,
      their spell failure rate is increased.
    - Monsters can be "blinded", in which case they will act as if the player is 
      invisible, and will be limited to innate attacks and breath attacks.
    - Monsters can be "bleeding", in which case they will lose some hp every turn 
      (the amount lost depends on their max HP).
    - Monsters can be "poisoned", in which case they will lose some hp every turn
      (the amount lose is independant of their max HP). 
    - Monster can be "calmed". A calm monster will not attack and will only cast 
      spells that heal itself or let it escape. The rate of recovery from calmness depends
      on the players charisma - the higher the charisma the slower the monster will recover.
      If the monster is hurt it will automatically recover, and also if it is aggravated.

- Ctrl-Q now gives you a description of your current quest.

- Reorganized the options:
    - Changed the catagories for many options.
    - Birth/Difficulty options now a submenu. 
    - During character creation, you can only access the birth/difficulty options.
    - Removed unused/redundant options: "show_choices", "show_details", "disturb_other",
      "alert_hitpoint", "verify_special", "dungeon_stair".
    - Added "verify_leaving_quest" option. 
    - Added "carry_heavy_query" option, which prompts you before picking up something
      that would slow you down.
    - Added a birth option ("birth_random_hp") that when turned off creates characters
      with non-random hitpoints (from Oangband 0.5.0)
    - All AI options now birth options; "smart_monsters" and "smart_learn" no longer 
      optional, while both "flow by" options are now on by default.
    - The option "easy_open" has been renamed "easy_direction"
    - The default values for several options have changed. 
    - You can now access help from the option menus (but not from the actual option
      screens).

- Re-arranged the resistances:
    - Resist fear renamed "bravery" (RES_FEAR flag became BRAVERY).
    - Resist blindness renamed "no blindness" (RES_BLIND flag becmae NO_BLIND).
    - Added resist water (RES_WATER). Reduces water damage and makes you immune to it's
      stunning/confusing effects.
    - Added resist disease (RES_DISEASE). Reduces disease damage and makes you immune 
      to getting the diseased status.
    - Added resist time (RES_TIME). Reduces time damage and makes you immune to it's
      draining effects.
    - Added resist mana (RES_MANA). Reduces mana damage.

- Spells modified:
    - Mages get a news spell (in [Sorcery and Evocations]) - "Blind Monster" which attempt to
      blind a single monster.
    - Rangers get a new spell (in [The Lore of the Hunter]) - "calm animals" which calms
      all animals in LOS.
    - Priests 2 new spells:
      - in [Purifications and Healing] - "Holy Peace" which calms all non-evil 
        creatures in LOS.
      - in [Chants and Blessings] - "Cure Disease" which rid the caster of all disease.
    - Priest spell "Turn undead" moved from [Chants and Blessings] to [Exorcism and 
      Dispellings] but otherwise not changed.
    - Priest spell "Teleport self" is now identical to mage spell of same name.
    - [The Necronomicon] gains a new spell - "Unlight Area".

- Experience drain attacks changed - now instead of causing xd6 + 2% of total exp damage,
  they just cause a variable percentage drain, which makes them more dangerous against
  high level characters and less against low-level characters.

- When creating a character, you can now press "!" in class selection to get a random
  class including illegal combinations ("*" allows only legal combinations).

- Cleaned up and re-arranged the code; many things are now in different place than they
  used to be.

- Tweaked quantities of quest monsters somewhat. In addition, you will no longer recieve 
  quests for breeding monsters, nor for monsters that can't move.

- Fixed the hitdice for angels and demons (this was a bug) - demons now have 10-sided dice
  (same as humans), angels 9-sided.

- Added new shopkeepers. Also, the minimum purse for the  weapon and armour shops raised 
  to 10000, and the minimum purses for all the general shop shopkeepers raised (to allow
  for the new magic lanterns and music instruments).

- When tweaking an item in debug mode, you can now change timeout.

- Added some variation in the player histories for half-orcs, angels and demons.

- EyAngband no longer requires the existance of the unused "lib\info", "lib\pref" and
  "lib\bone" directories in order to run.

- Rewrote help files, at some points incorporating portions of the Oangband help files, 
  and the auto-squelch FAQ.

## Item Changes ##

- Added new item flags (in addition to the resistances mentioned above):
  - MANA - the item adds pval*10 to maximum spell points.
  - HEALTH - the item adds pval*10 to maximum hit points.
  - IGNORE_DISEN - the item can not be disenchanted (NOT intrinsic in artifacts).
  - DRAIN_ITEM - your other equipped items have a random chance each turn of being
    disenchanted, unless you have disenchantment resistance.
  - WOUNDING - a weapon with this flag causes cuts to monster.
  - TERROR - a weapons with this flag increases the chances of monsters running away.
    Undead creatures are only affected if the weapon also has SLAY_UNDEAD.
  - BRAND_VENOM - a weapon branded with venom cause extra damage and poisons monsters
    that are not immune.
  - BRAND_LITE - a weapon branded with light causes extra damage and might blind monsters
    that are not resistant to light. Monstes vulnerable to light get even more damage and
    a higher chance of blindness.
  - BRAND_DARK - a weapon branded with darkness causes extra damage and might blind 
    monsters that are not resistant to darkness. Monstes vulnerable to darkness get even
    more damage and a higher chance of blindness.

  - SLAY_CHAOS - the weapon causes extra damage to chaotic creatures.

- Light sources have been reworked:

  - Light source TVALs have been split between refuelable lights and non-refuelable lights 
    (artifacts).
  - Magical lanterns are now flavoured, and need to be identified.
  - Magical lanterns only give their special powers when their fueled. 
  - To save space on some of the longer lantern names, the turns of light display has 
    been changed from "(With XXXX Turns of Light)" to "<XXXX>".

- Thrown flasks (of lantern oil or oil of burning) now don't damage creatures immune to
  fire.

- Several powders' powers and/or costs changed.

- Powders and food types now can appear in stacks.

## Monster Changes ##

- Many existing monsters altered:
  - Many monster gained some of the new flags, whereever appropriate.
  - Gremlins now worth even less EXP, and are now green to avoid confusion with manes.
  - Mummies attacks now cause disease, mummies made deeper.
  - Cockroaches now cause disease, cockroaches made deeper.
  - Existing "mystics" renamed to monks.
  - Monsters with two versions have their "group" version renamed to avoid double entries
    in the monster memory: Hell Hound -> Hell Wolf, Mumak -> Pack Mumak, Novice XXXs ->
    Young XXXs.

- Removed monsters: Novice hunter, Dread (single version), Carrion Crawler (group version).

- New monsters: Natural Quylthulg, Noxius Mushroom Patch, Mummified Giant, Acid Vortex, 
  Novice Mystic, Young Mystic, Mystic, Disease Mold, Chaos Mold, Giant Dog Ticks, 
  Acid Hound, Mana Hound, Greater Carrion Crawler, Noxious Jelly, Giant Tse-Tse fly,
  Chaos Cockroach, Maggot Mass, Diseased Rat, Light Spirit, Giant Mantis, Time Fly,
  Rabid Jackal, Rabid Wolf, Kobold Archer, Rabid Kobold, Chaos Naga.

- New uniques: Fang FarMer Maggot's Dog, Grip Farmer Maggot's Dog, The Negative Astral 
  Hound, The Positive Astral Hound.

- The NO_STUN keyword actually protects monsters from stunning (it used to do nothing).

- The BR_MANA flag actually causes the monsters to breate mana.

- The FRIEND, HURT_FIRE, BO_POIS and HURT_COLD flags were removed, since they didn't do
  anything.

- The S_ANT spell removed, and replaced by S_ANIMALS.

- Added new attack effect - DISEASE, which causes disease unless the player is resisant.

- Standardized the breathes and resistances. There is now a separate "RES_XXX" flag
  for each resistance; however, breathing something automatically includes the resistance.
  (including the basic elements and poison). This means that a monster can be resistant
  to something without having to be able to breathe it. Also, incorporated RES_CONFUSION 
  and NO_CONFUSION into one resist, and the IM_XXXX flags have been renamed RES_XXXX since 
  they didn't really grant immunity (note though that in general not all RES_XXXX flags 
  give the same degree of resistance). The monster's name no longer has any effect on
  the resistances.

- Added new monster flags - 
  - PLANT - monster is vulnerable to weapons of slay plant.
  - CHAOTIC - monster is vulnerable to weapons of slay chaos, and somewhat resistant to
    chaos.
  - HURT_DARK - monster is vulnerable to darkness.
  - NO_CUT - monster is immune to bleeding.
  - NO_BLIND - monster is immune to blindness.
  - NO_CALM - monster can not be calmed.
  - COMPANION - monster will appear accompanied by a unique from the same depth. Used
    for creating set groups of uniques.

- Added new monster spells -
  - BR_DISEASE - monster can breathe disease.
  - BR_WATER - monster can breathe water.
  - BLINK_TO - monster can teleport by the player.

- Renamed the monster flag BR_WALL to BR_FORCE since that's what it really is.

- Morgoth's description shortened a bit so his monster recall won't be too long.

## Bug fixes ##

- The squelch by quality menu no longer includes entries for "rings" and "amulets" (they
  didn't do anything).

- You can no longer cast spells when confused/blinded or in the dark, unless you are a 
  Mystic and have a mystic spellbook.

- The monster memory now correctly display EXP values for demon characters.

- Fixed a bug with starting equipment (you could never get the maximum amount of any

===============================================================================
This release is over a year overdue :( Sorry.
This release includes may changes, including changes made between Angband 2.8.2
and 2.8.3 - some things may have been broken.  As such, this is still an ALPHA
quality release - even more so than the previous one.  Please report any
problems to me (note new address at end).

Ironman-Angband (Ingband for short) is a "variant" of Angband, a successful
"graphical" dungeon adventure game derived many years ago from "Moria".  This
variant was originally developed in response to a discussion about playing
style on the Usenet group "alt.games.roguelike.angband" - future plans,
however, will make this variant much more than the simple "Angband with lots
taken out" game it started out as.  Suggestions are always welcome (e-mail
address at end).

This is the original Ironman Angband game, written by elemental (aka Robert
Shiells).  For an overview of recent changes, please read the file "CHANGES".


This game should work on the same platforms as Angband - if not, fixes would
be appreciated (but let me know about it even if you can't fix the problem
yourself).


Help on playing the game is available within the game itself by pressing [?],
or you can look at the files in the "lib/help" directory with your favourite
text viewer.  Please note, however, that the help is very out of date.


If you have the source distribution of Ingband, you will want to choose the
appropriate Makefile for your platform and edit it to your liking; you may
also want/need to edit config.h and h-config.h.  Then a simple "make" should
do the job...  Some specific requirements are listed in the relevant Makefile.


General ethos
=============
The character is a hard nut.  He will not wimp out of going into the dungeon,
and actually has an intense desire to travel deeper into the dungeon at every
available opportunity.  He wouldn't dream of going back up, except in a dire
emergency!  This type of character is likely to die young...

Ironman-Angband makes for a fun, short(er) game, for experienced players and
maybe not-so-experienced players alike...  So long as you can live with dying
frequently ;)


Notes
=====
The online help is still fairly unchanged from Angband; some of it will
therefore not make sense for this game.  I will be working on the help
shortly - I intend to implement a much more user-friendly system, within
the constraints of the multi-platform requirement.

Macintosh note, straight from Angband's README:

`The Macintosh requires that the "lib" folder be in the same folder as
the executable.  Also, note that System 7.5 (and perhaps others) are
brain damaged, and may default to the incorrect folder for opening
savefiles.  Make sure you keep all your savefiles in the proper place,
and if you load a savefile from the wrong place, note that the game
may decide to re-save your savefile in the proper place when you quit.
If you move the "lib" folder (or any ancestor folder) while a game is
in progress, you may not be able to save your game.  To use a savefile
from another platform (or really old version of Angband) you must use
the "Import..." menu command instead of the "Open..." menu command.'

Layout
======

This directory
  |    Informative text files
  |    The game binary, once compiled
  |
  +- src
  |    The complete source code (note: optional extras may be needed for
  |    some platforms, distributed seperately).
  |
  +- lib
     | Several sub-directories of data.
     |
     +- apex
     |     High score file, "scores.raw".  Must exist or be creatable
     |     for the game to run correctly.
     |
     +- data
     |     Binary files created using the data in the edit directory (see
     |     below).  These files are required, but will be created by the
     |     game if the edit directory contains valid files and if the game
     |     was compiled with the option to allow this.
     |     "a_info.raw" comes from "a_info.txt", and so on for each of
     |     "e_info.raw", "f_info.raw", "k_info.raw", "r_info.raw" and
     |     "k_info.raw".
     |
     +- edit
     |     Text files containing game data; used to create the files in the
     |     "data" directory (see above).  These files are required if the
     |     binary files in "data" are not available, and can be used to
     |     alter various things in the game (if you know what you're doing).
     |     "a_info.txt": Describes game artifacts (special equipment).
     |     "e_info.txt": Describes "ego" items - very good equipment.
     |     "f_info.txt": Describes terrain features, such as walls and doors.
     |     "k_info.txt": Describes kinds of objects.
     |     "r_info.txt": Describes monster races.
     |     "v_info.txt": Describes special "vault" rooms.
     |
     +- file
     |     Contains several special text files.
     |     "news.txt" is displayed when the game is started.
     |     "dead.txt" is displayed when a player dies.
     |     "guild[1-7].txt" are files containing guild information, displayed
     |       when the player enters the corresponding guild building in town.
     |     "wizards.txt" can be created to restrict players entering "wizard" mode.
     |     "time.txt" can be created to restrict the times at which the game may
     |       be played.
     |     "load.txt" can be created to restrict the load the game may impose on
     |       the system.
     |     Support for "wizards.txt" "time.txt" and "load.txt" is platform-specific
     |     and requires support to be configured-in.  More information is available
     |     in the configuration files and in the source itself (see "files.c").
     |
     +- help
     |     Contains the standard online-help files.  These are (currently) plain
     |     text files.  The special "help.hlp" is the first file displayed, and
     |     contains a list of all other help files available, assigning them to
     |     numeric keys.  Additional help can be created in the "info" directory
     |     and the appropriate entry made in "help.hlp" (but note that there can
     |     be a maximum of ten files listed).
     |
     +- info
     |     Contains (optional) online spoiler files.  This directory is searched
     |     for help files not found in "help".  The default "help.hlp" file (in
     |     the "help" directory) allows key 9 to access "spoiler.hlp" and key 0
     |     to access "user.hlp", which should be created here if required.
     |
     +- save
     |     Contains player savefiles.  These are named in accordance with the
     |     character in the game.  On multi-user platforms, these will be prefixed
     |     with the numerical uid of the player (and a ".").  Savefiles are
     |     portable between systems, assuming that they are renamed appropriately.
     |
     +- user
     |     Contains user preference files, allowing various aspects of the game
     |     to be customized.
     |
     +- xtra
           Contains special system files, if applicable.

Currently Langband is crippled and barely working, but it can be
loaded and used.

You need:
- A decent computer and system (Linux, fast enough and with a decent
  amount of memory)
- CMU Common Lisp (there exists a decent package for Debian)

Might be used:
- Allegro Common Lisp (is not active dev-platform anymore due to license)

How to start it:

- tweak lib/zterm/Makefile  (Probably only ENVIRONMENT and CMUCL needs to be changed.)
- run 'make'  (where make is GNU Make)
- start lisp
- (load "game")
- (lb::a)

(Select a high-elf warriour for the most developed char)

See the web/-directory.

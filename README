Currently Langband is not anywhere close to being to finished and it
is barely working.  It can be loaded and you may attempt to move
around somewhate. 

You need:

  - A decent computer and system
    Linux, fast enough and with a decent amount of memory
    
  - CMU Common Lisp
    There exists a decent package for Debian

Might be used:

  - Allegro Common Lisp
    is not active dev-platform anymore due to license

    
How to start it:

  - tweak lib/zterm/Makefile
    Probably only ENVIRONMENT and CMUCL needs to be changed.
    ***Only the X11 option is really recommended right now***
    
  - run 'make'
    Where make is GNU Make
    
  - start your lisp and get a prompt for the two following commands:
  
  - (load "game")
    loads/compiles the core engine mostly
  
  - (lb::a)
    loads/compiles vanilla variant and helper-libraries
    on first run, it will take a _lot_ of time on obj-kind.lisp


How to play:

  Create a character, the details do not matter at this stage so
  anything will do.  You will eventually find yourself (the @) in a
  town, but currently no shops work and silly messages are printed now
  and then.  Move around the character with the arrowkeys or the
  numpad. Other keys:
  
    > - go down a stair
    < - go up a stair
    e - show worn equipment
    i - show backpack equipment
    C - show the character facts
    g - get an item from the ground
    d - drop an item to the ground
    w - wear an item from backpack
    o - open all surrounding doors
    p - prints a map of dungeon to map.ascii (debugging)
    P - prints a ppm map to map.ppm (debugging)
    z - "zap" the game (expert debugging)
    Q - quit the game

  The keys and their code may be found in lib/common/keys.lisp

  
What to do on crash or bugs:

  See the docs in the web/ directory.  An undocumented feature is the
  GAME-LOOP& function which might in some cases be called if an
  already working game has given you the lisp-prompt and you have
  fixed any problems.  This is mainly of use to me at this stage
  though.

  See the web/-directory.

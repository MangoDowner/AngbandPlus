Currently Langband is not anywhere close to being to finished and it
is barely working.  It can be loaded and you may attempt to move
around somewhat and you might be killed by over-aggressive monsters. 

You need:

  - A decent computer and system
    Linux, fast enough and with a decent amount of memory
    
  - CMU Common Lisp
    There exists a decent package for Debian

Might be used:

  - Allegro Common Lisp
    is not active dev-platform anymore due to license

  - CLISP
    is a bit tricky to get working, see the FAQ for more info

  - Lispworks on Linux
    Should work fairly well.

  - Lispworks on Win32
    
    May have problems, and has not been tested recently.  See FAQ for
    more info on the Win32 port.

  - SBCL (on Linux)

    Should work fairly well, make sure you get v0.7.7 or newer.


    
How to start it:

  - tweak zterm/Makefile
    Probably only ENVIRONMENTS needs to be changed.
    *** It is safe to have SDL and GCU at the moment***

  - run 'make'
    Where make is GNU Make
    
  - start your lisp and get a prompt for the two following commands:
  
  - (load "game")
    loads/compiles the core engine mostly

Either
  - (langband)
    loads vanilla variant and runs it in curses-mode.
Or
  - (gfx-langband)
    loads vanilla variant and runs it with SDL-support.


  - Use (quit) in CMUCL/SBCL/LW/CLISP or (exit) in ACL to quit afterwards.

  [If you use the Langband Debian-packages, see README.Debian
   for starting-details.]

How to play:

  Create a character, the details do not matter at this stage so
  anything will do.  You will eventually find yourself (the @) in a
  town, but currently no shops work and silly messages are printed now
  and then.  Move around the character with the arrowkeys or the
  numpad. Other keys:
  
    > - go down a stair
    < - go up a stair
    C - show the character facts
    d - drop an item to the ground
    e - show worn equipment
    E - eat something
    f - fire a missile
    g - get an item from the ground
    i - show backpack equipment
    o - open all surrounding doors
    p - invoke a spell (not working)
    q - quaff a potion
    Q - quit the game
    r - read a scroll
    s - search area
    S - save the game (save-file in ~/.angband/langband/ will be used on restart)
    u - use an item
    w - wear an item from backpack

  See also lib/help/keys.txt and the actual code in variants/vanilla/keys.lisp
  
What to do on crash or bugs:

  See the docs in the web/ directory.  An undocumented feature is the
  GAME-LOOP& function which might in some cases be called if an
  already working game has given you the lisp-prompt and you have
  fixed any problems.  This is mainly of use to me at this stage
  though. 

Known bugs:
  - Things may lock up somewhere in the magic-commands
  - Eat-command doesn't work
  - Suddenly -more- refuses to be government by anything else than
    the spacebar.  Very annoying.
  - Repaint issues on the fringes
  - Some repaint-issues when opening/closing doors and when killing
    monsters with spells.  ^R redraw command usually works though.
  - Windows port does not support TTF-fonts
  - Themes are not awfully changable at the moment, and some parts of
    the code (mouseclick) depend on hardcoded coordinates.  Braindead, I
    know, but I wanted to toss out a release.

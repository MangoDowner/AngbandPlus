Some basic help for Kamband newbies:

You can use `#' (control-z in rouguelike keyset) to call your pets.

Use `O' to interact with deities -- when on an altar, this will 
let you sacrifice something, otherwise it will show your current
deity. You can align yourself with a deity by scarificing somthing for
the first time. Beware -- deities are fickle and want frequent sacrifices.

Use `$' to mix alchemical recipes. You have a few recipes to start with,
and you can get more by experimentation or reading a scroll of recipe.
The recipes do not change between games.

Use the `I' command to read parchments, and to see an item's material and
damage status.

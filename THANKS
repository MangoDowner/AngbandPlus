Many people should be thanked and I cannot remember you
all.  But I've tried to maintain a list.

- #angband on IRC with it's many inhabitants.  Many of them
  know the angband sources well and have patiently answered
  many of my questions.

- all those who have tested and reported bugs, problems and
  improvements for langband.

- Scott Holder for adding numeric-ids to all my monsters when I needed
  them and out of stupidity had forgotten to include them for backward
  compatibility to vanilla angband.  Lots of ugly grunt-work that
  needed doing.
 
- The tiles in graphics/tiles have been made by David E Gervais.

- The pictures in graphics/people/ have been made by various people on
  the Net.  The ones used are just examples to demonstrate the code,
  and will be replaced at a later stage with pictures with specific
  permissions for use with Langband.

****************************************************************************
Our story so far...
  It is the time of the Conjunction of a Million Spheres. Your Earth is
composed almost entirely of cave-riddled mountains (which have their own
dark inhabitants, known mostly by rumour), with villages in the few fertile
valleys that exist. Except for high summer, movement and trade between the
villages is almost impossible.
  Fresh rumour begins infiltrating the villages.  Rumours about the strange,
otherworldly beings that have begun to concentrate in the vast system of
caves under the mountains.  Rumours that the forces of Chaos are gathering
in unheard of numbers (led by three Chaos Lords referred to only as "The
Sword Rulers"), somewhere deep within the Earth, preparing for a great
battle with Law, upsetting the rule of the Cosmic Balance on your plane.
  Something needs to be done.  The Balance must be restored.  Someone must
journey to the bowels of the Earth and attempt to banish these Sword Rulers
from your plane...

Send any and all complaints (or praise ;) to aa343@chebucto.ns.ca. Patches,
makefiles, etc., should be sent to gumby_jd@yahoo.com (due to a lack of
INBOX space at the first address).
============================================================================
PLEASE NOTE: Preserving savefile compatability is *NOT* important to me. I
highly suggest you finish up your current character in your current version
before moving to this one. At the very least, monster memory could be
severely messed up between versions...
============================================================================
Thanks to all the folks in #angband and rec.games.roguelike.angband who've
put up with me, and even helped me in many cases, while I was plundering
their knowledge of C for this little project. :) So, if you've responded to
any of my posts dealing with Gumband, or C programming in general, consider
yourself thanked. :) [individual thanks will be down there in the entries
that apply]
============================================================================
Thanks also to those who've been compiling Gumband for other platforms. You
know who you are, and since it sometimes changes, I won't lay the blame in
here. ;) Just make sure to give yourself credit for the compile in the text
file you upload with your archive, 'kay?
============================================================================
Note to Windows users: Remember to change Gumband.ini to reflect the path to
\lib on your own system....
============================================================================
Note to Linux users: There may be problems with the ` macro I have defined
in .\lib\user\pref.prf (everyone should read that file, BTW), so you might
want to remove it. Also, best to check the files in linux_fix.tar.gz as they
should help Gumband work better on your system.
============================================================================
Note to all users: I can't say this enough - read this file and
.\lib\help\birth.txt! These files are kept updated and contain important
information. Plus, it'll reduce the number of questions I have to answer
over and over and over... :) Also, read ./lib/user/pref.prf and the other
files there so you can undo or change the macros I've set...

======================================================================
= Gumband 2.2.0d = Last Update: 18-May-2002 = Bugfix release, mainly =
======================================================================
01) Changed how extra dice on ego-items and artifacts are calculated again.
See object2.c and artifact.c for details. In short, the number of extra dice
is again as rare as it was in v2.2.0a. Extra dice for random artifacts is
also that rare. Ego-items and randarts can also have extra dice sides, which
are slightly more common than extra dice. Ammunition can only have the
number of dice increased, at the same rarity as above. [thanks to Antimatter
and Qlzqqlzup of #angband for their help squashing the bug this caused :]
02) Upon death, all items in your equipment and inventory will be
*Identified* so that all of your resistances will be shown in a dump made
upon character death.
03) Steel Shields are now a bit lighter than their iron counterparts, just
as Steel Helms are lighter than Iron Helms.

=============================================
= Gumband 2.2.0c = Last Update: 17-Apr-2002 =
=============================================
01) Holy Defenders were too common. They are now generated on a 1-in-10
chance when a normal Defender would be chosen. Also, like Defenders, Holy
Defenders have a chance for gaining Resist Poison...
02) Probing now reveals *all* of a monster's flags, including spells.
03) If you choose to play a High-Mage with Sorcery *and* you choose the
Quick Start option, you will begin the game with a Wand of Magic Missiles in
addition to the normal Quick Start bonuses.
04) Altered the messages for the CHAOS_GIFT mutation - they're not Chaos
deities, they're Chaos Lords...
05) Beware! Mabelrode the Faceless now moves at +40 speed!  Xiombarg moves
now moves at +30.  Arioch remains at +20.
06) Rearranged the spell macros in .\lib\user\Death.prf and
.\lib\user\Rogue.D a bit.
07) Astral characters with the Stair Creation spell can no longer create
down stairs on dungeon level 97 (thus being able to reach Arioch) without
visiting the town first.
08) Created the word_of_recall() function [in spells3.c] to get rid of
unnecessary duplication... [the code appeared 7 or so times]
09) New monster blow and effect flag: CHAOTIC. A monster with one of these
will have a randomly generated attack method (claw, tentacle, drool, etc.)
or effect (fire, disenchant, confuse, etc.) each time it hits.
10) Monster gender is now correctly displayed when performing a TONGUE or
TENTACLE attack.
11) The 'Mind Blast' Trump spell, mutation and Mindflayer racial ability,
plus Mindcrafter's 'Neural Blast', are now 0-radius ball spells instead of
bolt spells.
12) New monster blow effect: RBE_VORPAL. If you aren't Reflecting and don't
resist Shards, such attacks will *always* cut you.
13) While the player is Blessed, they get the effect of having Slay Evil if
their melee weapon (or while fighting bare-handed as a Monk) doesn't already
have it.
14) The character's Tunneling skill is now shown in the skills section of
the character sheet. [skill must be greater than 40+d1600 to dig through
granite, 20+d800 to dig through quartz, and 10+400 to dig through magma,
checked each turn of digging]

=============================================
= Gumband 2.2.0b = Last Update: 26-Feb-2002 =
=============================================
01) Added the display of resistance and ability flags (the lower half of the
'Chh' screen) to the character dump.
02) Poisonous hits from monsters and traps (floor and chest) now last as
long as the poison from the mushroom/potion of Poison and GF_POIS effects.
03) During point-based generation of a character, you can now stop assigning
points even when you have points left over.
04) Damage dealt in melee by one monster against another has been tripled.
05) Extra dice on ego-items (but not random artifacts or missiles) are now
more common.
06) Added Holy Defender weapons from SAngband.
07) *Slay* weapons removed and most of their abilities transfered to the
regular Slay weapons.

=================================
= Changes from ZAngband v2.1.1c =
=================================

Linux section. Other needed files for running Gumband on Linux are included

and mildly enchanted ego-equipment]

DarkGod, RML, Timo Pietila and Parak for their help and advice]

symbol.
39) The monster health bar shows stunned (light brown) and confused (dark

causing earthquakes or causing your foe to vanish.
50) Added a SLAY_HUMANOID flag, x3 base damage to humanoid creatures.

you unless you're wearing gauntlets or cesti.
52) Brands and Slays are now cumulative See cmd1.c for full details.

player cannot be sold to the shops.
54) Changed the code that adds random sustains, abilities and high resists
into the RAND_SUST, RAND_ABILITY, and RAND_RESIST object flags. Do *NOT* use
these on items other than ego-items (e_info.txt).

61) Apportation can only fetch() objects that are 20lbs or less that are
outside of vaults and only while the player is on an empty floor space.
62) Identify and *Identify* now have filtered lists, showing only those
items that need to be identified.
63) Potions of *Enlightenment* also identify *every* object on the level.
64) 'Invulnerability' (spells and items) is now 'Resilience'.
65) Polearms are now brown so that they are visibly different from Axes.
66) Shields of Deflection and Dragon Shields now use the normal shield
symbol {')'} instead of the hard armour symbol {'['}.
67) The chance of an object being 'good' is now capped at 95%. The chance of
a good object becoming 'great' is now 25%.
68) Protection from Evil is now more effective and can affect creatures
deeper than level 50.
69) Failure rates for spellcasting are adjusted as follows:
   Wearing gloves (without Free Action or a Dexterity bonus) for mage-type
      spellcasters (+15%)
   Being encumbered by heavy armour [penalty to fail equal to half of the
      amount of mana you lose for heavy armour]
   Priests wielding a non-blessed edged weapon (+15%)
   Being Berserk (+25%)
   Being stunned (+15%/+25%)
70) Characters suffering any of the conditions above can no longer get a 0%
 spell failure rate, no matter how high their spell-stat or level is.
71) Altered the armour weight limits for spellcasting. See .\help\birth.txt.
72) Many changes to the spell lists and effects.  See .\lib\help\magic.txt
and .\src\cmd5.c for the details.

                    ####### Known Bugs #######

 There are too many potions in the game at the moment, so a few potions
 cannot be generated via debug mode's item creation menus since the list
 runs out of symbols fairly quickly. It is not a priority to fix.

 If you look through the entire monster list ['/' then CTRL-a] while the
 'know all monster info' cheat is active, you will see the occasional blank
 monster (ie, The ('')/(''): [(r)ecall, ESC]). This is because there are
 still empty slots in r_info.txt, which I will eventually fill.

 Sometimes, completely at random, the Roguelike option will set itself to
 true upon startup. I have no idea why... [hasn't happened in quite a while
 as of 06-Dec-01]

 I've been noticing that sometimes there won't be as many quest-monsters on
 a level as there are supposed to be, meaning that a quest can't be finished
 that trip. :( I think KILL_BODY got rid of them? There's no check for
 QUESTOR (or UNIQUE) status for KILL_BODY's effect in the original code, so
 it might very well be the problem... I've added a check, so it might be
 fixed - if this bug crops up in this version, someone please mail me, 'kay?

 Sometimes aggravate_monsters (via scrolls, Rogue thefts, etc., but not the
 permanent attribute) doesn't wake up sleeping monsters. Noticed it
 happening on two creatures so far: the Mangy looking leper and the Battle-
 scarred veteran. Some games it'll wake them up, some games it won't. :(

 Random artifact amulets and rings that are of a type that starts with the
 EASY_KNOW flag will be automatically identified if you've previously ident-
 ified the base type of ring or amulet. Not really worth fixing, IMHO.

 If an object has a random ability (resistance, power, or sustain), it will
 reroll the ability and sometimes lose the ability. So don't Brand a
 Defender if you need that confusion resistance it's giving you! :) I can't
 think of any solution to preserve the xtra info...

 Sometimes, when hit by GF_FORCE (wand of Striking, Fist of Force spell), a
 monster standing by a permanent wall on the outer edge of the map will
 disappear. This is *very* bad in the case of quest monsters... Also, if the
 monster is hit while standing directly in front of 1 grid of granite, or a
 door, or whatever, it will be pushed through to the other side. (see,
 starting at lines 2536 and 4000, spells1.c for details - I'm stumped as to
 how to fix it: any solutions gratefully accepted)

 Finally got around to marking all the compiler warnings (that I get with
 gcc v3.02) in the source. Just search for '/* warning:'. Anyone who can fix
 them, mail me.

 When generating a point-based character in non-Maximize mode, some
 combinations (like Gambolt Beastmaster) can reach a maximum of 18/110 for a
 stat. This is not good. :(

 Sometimes when a friendly/pet monster summons a Unique, that Unique will be
 friendly despite code in process_monster() to prevent that from happening.

## FIXED: The game should no longer crash, or at least not nearly as often,
 upon entering a level. At least one of the causes was the game attempting
 to boost the non-existant damage dice of random artifact rings and amulets,
 which caused an infinite loop...

## FIXED: The Broad Sword of the Dawn should no longer appear twice. This
 means, unfortunately, that Dorian Hawkmoon will no longer always drop it.
 He now has a chance of dropping either the Sword *or* the Red Amulet,
 instead of always dropping the Sword and having a chance to drop the
 Amulet...

Changes in PsiAngband 1.3.0:

- The codebase was updated to vanilla 2.9.2 (except for autoconf support)

- Cursed ego items are generated in a more sensible manner now.

- Objects with boosted damage dice are slightly more common.

- Rogues can set traps for monsters. This requires a "trapping kit" as a trigger
  and something to "load" the trap with. This uses the "p" command.
  All scrolls, potions, wands, staffs and rods can be used (with the appropriate
  trigger) as traps to confuse, poison, teleport, genocide, ... unwary monsters.
  But standing next to a trap with area effect will hurt the player, too.
  There are also traps that shoot ammo: hidden catapults, bows and xbows.
  
  Some monsters can disarm traps, and a monster that has disarmed one of your
  traps will learn how to disarm all of them...
  
  Ammo Traps can have (+hit,+dam) just like bows. They can also be enchanted.
  All traps can have a [+AC] showing how hard it is to disarm it.
  There is also ego and artifact traps.

  A note: If you use the "Disarm traps on movement" option, you own trap will also be 
  disarmed by moving into it. To prevent this, move with "-"+ direction. (This is also
  good for using a trap door or teleportation trap to escape from a vault.)
  
- A bookstore was added. The town will change to a new town, so don't leave anything
  on the floor when you upgrade your savefile!
  
- Since several monsters changed their positions, some uniques might get resurrected.
  Apart from that, 1.2.0 savefiles should work. Back them up first, just to be sure,
  and if you encounter a problem, send the 1.2.0 savefile to me (mawende@gmx.net) and
  I'll try to fix it. 

- Searching and Pseudo-ID bonus combined to "Sensing". Amulets of Pseudo-ID will be
  magically converted (read:hacked) into Amulets of Sensing. 
  
- Psionic Foci are "*" now. Hidden gold is "$".

- Lots of new amulets were added, some of which give a rating boost and are mentioned
  to cheaters. Some of these are also not good for spellcasters... and there's several
  other rather class-specific ego-items and artifacts.

- Priests should only use blunt or blessed ammo, or get a severe to-hit penalty (-15).  

- Being hungry no longer has effects on your speed.

- Potions of Infravision give +30 feet now.

- Adrenaline (as potions or as spell) is a *lot* better now, but too much of it is
  still dangerous...

- Heavy Curses (such as on Calris) can't be broken by enchanting alone anymore. 
  But *Remove Curse* scrolls appear during stat gain now. 

- Precognition should be less scummy than in 1.0.7b and more useful than in 1.2.0 now.

- Some low-level psionic spells have a better damage/mana ratio now.

- Psionicists have more hitpoints.
    
- The spell and activation of clairvoyance don't detect objects anymore.
  But *Enlightenment* still does.

- Revamped targetting for Telekinesis, Dimension Door etc.  

- Summoning flags changed slightly.

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/e_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "ego-item" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/e_info.raw" file.

# The ego-item indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed.

# Ego-items 1-63 are "armor", and 64-127 are "weapons"

# Note that every "ego-item" type has a different "index", and can only be
# created from items that belong to a certain "slot" in the equipment, if
# one assumes that "ammo" belongs to an imaginary slot (23).  However, it
# is possible for several "ego-item" types to have the same "textual name",
# such as with "Armor of Resistance" and "Shield of Resistance".

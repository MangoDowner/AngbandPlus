# File: e_info.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/e_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "ego-item" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/e_info.raw" file.

# The ego-item indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed.

# Ego-items 1-63 are "armor", and 64-127 are "weapons"

# Note that every "ego-item" type has a different "index", and can only be
# created from items that belong to a certain "slot" in the equipment, if
# one assumes that "ammo" belongs to an imaginary slot (23).
#
# Note that several "ego-item" types may share the same "textual name",
# such as with "Armor of Resistance" and "Shield of Resistance".

#   Changes made by Jonathan Ellis...

#   Elemental brands have been renamed to Fire, Frost, Lightning and Acid. 
#   Bow of "Velocity" renamed to "Power": Velocity means "speed" where I come
# from, and I don't see any speed bonuses on that particular ego-bow, nor should
# there be.
#   Ammo slays are now "Slay" instead of "Hurt": the same flag was used, not 
# much point in the different name... 

#   From OAngband: Helmets of Serenity (resist confusion and sound.) Helmets
# of Infravision have gone to make room (Helmets of Seeing now give 
# infravision in addition to their original powers.) 

#   Cloaks of Protection now give shard resistance. Took this idea from 
# OAngband where there are Cloaks of Shard Protection. The cloaks are, however,
# rarer than they used to be. And more expensive... (If it's any help, visualise
# a cloak made of an exceptionally durable material that isn't slashed up easily,
# either by weapons or by shrapnel.)

#    Acid and Lightning branded arrows.

#    Weapons of Morgul are now usable by players, if you are willing to live
# with the penalties... A weapon of Morgul will prevent most other monsters
# from draining your life, and indeed is the only non-artifact that can do so
# (hence, resist nether and hold life.) And this weapon, a weapon of the 
# undead, also grants power over the undead (slay undead.) However, to use it
# puts the wielder in danger of his very soul (it drains experience) and alerts
# the netherworld to the presence of the wielder (aggravate monster.) Add to
# this the fact that it may have penalties to-hit and to-dam...

#    Holy Avengers, crowns of Lordliness and Serenity resist fear.

#    Change by Matthias Kurzke: I have adapted this file for usage with my
# 'dyanmic e_info' patch. It should produce a nearly identical ego-item 
# distribution as Jonathan Ellis' original. (Differences are less than 1%,
# mostly 0%).

# Further changes since then, made by Jonathan Ellis (JLE):

#    Some item rarities have been tweaked. JLE thought that the shields should
# be like the armor in that all four of the "standard" four single-resist ego-
# types should be about the same rarity.

#    Which items can be helmets and crowns has also been redone. It works as 
# follows:
# - single-stat helms are only caps/helmets, not crowns. Light and Regeneration
#   likewise belong to helms only.
# - Crowns of Might, Lordliness and the Magi can only be crowns, not helmets. A 
#   new ego-type (of Night and Day) can also only be crowns.
# - Telepathy, Seeing and Serenity apply to both crowns and helms.
# - Of the cursed items: Teleportation is helms only, Dullness is crowns only, 
#   Sickliness is both.

#    Boots of Stability -  resist nexus and feather fall. Rarer than any other
# boots except speed.

#    *Slay* extra bonuses have been reworked. *Slay Demon* provides resistance
# to fire, as many demons use fire attacks, in addition to its int bonus. *Slay 
# Undead* keeps its see invis and blessed state. *Slay Troll* allows you to 
# regenerate like a troll and increases your strength. *Slay Giant* gives you
# the strength of a giant and sustains that strength. *Slay Orc* gives you 
# sustain dexterity as well as a dex bonus. *Slay Dragon* of course has kill 
# dragon and constitution. *Slay Animal* allows you to go for days without food,
# like many hunting animals, as well as giving you intelligence. *Slay Evil* is
# blessed and has a wisdom bonus.

#    A "bad" ego-type for both armor and shields: Vulnerability (in both cases.)
# This has been added in case anybody ever wants to adopt JLE's suggestion of 
# changing pseudo-ID so that "cursed" items can masquerade as "good" items
# until magically identified (i.e. both "good" and "cursed" pseudo-ID as "magic", 
# both "excellent" and "worthless" become "extraordinary", both "special" and
# "terrible" become "unique") in accordance with the long-held AD&D principle - 
# so that you can't automatically put on an "extraordinary" armor knowing that 
# there is no cursed type of armor. Vulnerability cloaks no longer exist.

#    Boots of Annoyance no longer exist, and the helmets of Stupidity, Naivety
# and Ugliness have been combined into one of "Dullness". This is to make way 
# for the potential creation of more ego-types of helmet.

#    A "bad" ego-type for bows as well: the bows of the Nazgul are cursed and
# drain experience, but permit the player to see into the wraith-world (see 
# invisible.) So now, every type of item has either one or two "bad" ego-types:
# crowns and helms have three between them, but one is only applicable to 
# crowns (Dullness) and one to helms (Teleportation): both can get Sickliness.

#    Ammo no longer slays orcs or trolls, only the more wide-ranging x2 slays
# (animal and evil) and the "big three" x3 slays - demons, undead and dragons.
# Slay Giant has also been retained for the benefit of Titans, and Wounding is 
# of course common.

#    The Gauntlets formerly known as Power are now "of Combat" (so as to avoid
# confusion with missile launchers of Power) and are only for gauntlets and 
# cesti, not leather gloves. Think big metal gauntlets with spikes... And they 
# have a minimum depth as well.

#    Pinched from OAngband (like so many other of my ideas :-) Dwarven Armor.
# May only be heavy armor, metal scale mail and upwards - not rusty chain mail 
# as dwarven stuff does not rust. In fact, it cannot be damaged by anything, 
# and furthermore provides a big AC bonus, free action and small bonuses to 
# strength and constitution.

#    Normal missile launchers of Extra Might can only have a +1 bonus. No more 
# Heavy Crossbows of Extra Might (+2) that are really (x6). But look at what else 
# you're getting (see below.) Only the new, rarer and special types of missile 
# launcher can have the +2 bonus to extra might.

### Some new ego-items have been added that are depth-dependent. They are 
### usually rarer than other ego-types. And often more powerful...

#    Shield of Preservation: preserves the character's body, life force and 
# magical equipment (sustain str, con and dex, hold life, disenchantment
# resistance, one other random resist.)

#    Crown of Night and Day: basically an improvement on a Cap of Light, in 
# that it grants resistance to light and darkness as well as providing 
# permanent light.

#    Gloves of Thievery: only leather gloves, not gauntlets or cesti. Provide
# dexterity, free action, searching and feather fall, and a bonus to-hit but 
# not to-dam.

#    Boots of Elvenkind - speed (up to +5), stealth, feather fall. Leather 
# boots only, not metal shod. Boot rarities have been tweaked to make sure 
# that boots providing speed are no more common than they used to be. (Now 
# 3 in 60 rather than what I originally remember as being 1 in 25, but one
# of the types of speed-providing boot can only give up to +5. This leaves
# the *average* plus to-speed, counted across all ego-boots, at 0.23 - as 
# opposed to 0.22 before the changes. Don't go calling me generous, now...)

#    Blade of Gondolin: slays demon, orc, troll and dragon. Provides one 
# random ability, plus permanent light (it shines when there are enemies 
# about - which is *everywhere* in Angband) and resist darkness. Sharp 
# (non-priestly) weapons only.

#    Weapon of Fury: heavy weapons only, give up to 2 extra attacks and have 
# big to-hit and to-damage bonuses and resist fear. But they aggravate. It is 
# intended to give them a penalty to-AC if someone can be bothered to tweak the 
# code to allow negative bonuses to non-cursed items - and positive bonuses to
# cursed items. This already exists in SAngband and OAngband (hint, hint.) And
# if anyone knows how to give this item an activation for Berserk Fury...

#    Sling of Buckland: gives up to +2 dex, extra might and shots. A sling, at last,
# which can compete with bows and crossbows in the later stages of the game. No 
# special to-hit or damage bonuses, though, unlike the new ego bows and crossbows.
# The chance of getting +2 extra shots with a x4 sling is enough - even if you do
# consider that the ammo's base damage is no more than 1d3 for iron shots.

#    Bow of Lothlorien: up to +2 extra might and dex, random ability, free 
# action, and +10 each to-hit and to-dam.

#    Crossbow of the Haradrim: a simple yet unsubtle damage machine, extra might 
# *and* shots (but only +1), damage bonus higher than normal.

#    Ammo of Holy Might - can only be heavy ammo (seeker bolts, iron shots, 
# seeker arrows): slay demon, undead, evil, fire brand. Rare and powerful.

# Poison-branded weapons and ammo are in the game, in the correct slots, but 
# with all entries commented out. (They are in slots number 76 and 120.) If 
# poison brand is added to the game, remove the "# " at the beginning of each 
# line in the relevant entries.

# The same is true for the as yet non-existent KILL_DEMON and KILL_UNDEAD flags
# on weapons of *Slay*ing demon and undead: they have been added, but commented
# out.

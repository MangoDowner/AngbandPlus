The third value is the probability and the fourth value is the modifier 
to social status (plus 50, for easy encoding of negative modifiers). 
As an example, let's look at the first two chart entries for elves. The 
first entry is number 5: 
N:5:6:60:50 
D:You are one of several children 
N:5:6:100:55 
D:You are the only child 
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated. If it's 60 or less, then 
"You are one of several children", and the social class is unchanged, 
since (50 - 50) = 0. If the number was from 61 to 100, then "You are the 
only child" and your social class increases by 5 points (55 - 50). 
Next entry, in both cases (yes, you could use different branches, though 
thiss facility is unused in the current h_info.txt), is entry 6: 
N:6:9:40:40 
D:of an Avarin 
N:6:9:70:50 
D:of a Nandorin 
N:6:9:100:60 
D:of a Sindarin 
Again, a random number from 1 to 100 is chosen. If it's up to 40, you 
are "of an Avarin" and lose 10 points social status (40 - 50 = -10); 41 
through 70 makes you "of a Nandorin" and leaves social status unchanged 
and 71 or more makes you "of a Sindarin" and social status increases by 
10 points.

	knight prayers:  (1st spell- 5)
    A warrior with a few prayers and high charisma.  He learns prayers very slowly, except for a few specialty prayers which include turn undead, remove curse, and elemental brand for his weapon. He tends to have lower skills than a warrior, so I think he'll be a rather hard class to play.

	Alchemist Spells:
    A mage who learns spells with a lot of trial and error.  Because of this he cannot chose which spells he learns, has higher fail rates, and generally learns spells slower than other spellcasters.  To make up for this, his specialty spells include some powerful early spells including stinking cloud, and his spellcasting is not hindered by gloves. (An alchemist needs his gloves!)  His skills tend to be lower than the mage, but he has noticably more strength than the mage and also is a halfway decent fighter (unlike the mage).

L47 meteor swarm

	Archer spells:
     A very hard class to play because archery is his only strength.  He's a decent melee fighter but not as good as the paladin or ranger, not to mention the warrior.  Starting at level 32, he learns a few spells (8 in total) with include shield and, of course, elemental brand for his ammo. At very high levels he does have two powerful attack spells.  One other strength is that he advances in level faster than any but the warrior.

	Healer prayers:
     Another hard class to play, the healer specializes in healing prayers and starts out with the deep dungeon spellbook which specializes in healing. He has low strength, and his fighting is only barely better than the mage.  He can learn prayers other than healing ones on later levels, but no orb of draining and he's very bad at teleporting spells.  Two unique things about him is that (1)his gods let him choose which prayer to learn next, and (2)he uses his intelligence stat for prayers rather than using wisdom, which makes him more fitting for the elf and gnome races which are more likely to be healers than dwarves are.

	Druid Spells
     A priest of nature. Though you can call him a priest, it would seem silly to pray to nature, so he casts spells instead and is almost as good at it as the mage.  He is the only one besides the mage who can cast spells at 0% fail. Being powerful in magic, a halfway-decent fighter, and having good skills, he needs some drawbacks, so he is both encumbered by gloves and penalized for edged weapons, and he advances at the same somewhat slow rate of the mage.  He starts with unique armor (good) and a unique weapon (mediocure), and a mushroom (because he knows his mushrooms).  Another unique thing about him is that he uses wisdom to cast spells.

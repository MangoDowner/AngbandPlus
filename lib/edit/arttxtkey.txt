# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/artifact.raw" file.

# N: serial number : item name
# I: tval : sval : pval
# W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
# P: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
# F: flag | flag | etc
# A: activation : recharge time : recharge time dice

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
# sval identifies the subtype and the pval indicates the amount of
# effect the item has, if applicable.

# 'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is
# normally found at, rarity determines how common the object is,
# weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value.

# 'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base
# damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'A' is for activation.  Activation is the effect the artifact
# activates for. The recharge time calculates from the recharge time
# plus a random value between 1 and the recharge time dice (if not 0).
# If an activation is given then the artifact must also have the
# ACTIVATE flag.

### IMPORTANT NOTES ###
# (1.) Any changes or additions to the file will have influence on randarts
# and may break savefile compatibility for old savegames with randarts.  If
# using random artifacts, finish your existing game before making any
# changes to the artifact.txt file at all.
# (2.) Removing any artifact, or changing its "base" type (as defined by
# the tval and sval entries in the "I:" line), will break savefile
# compatibility for ALL savefiles.
# (3.) Adding a new artifact, or changing the powers of existing ones, will
# NOT affect savefile compatibility for games with the standard artifact set:
# it is perfectly safe to do this. (If your new artifact is a new kind of
# object, or a new one at the end of the file, you must also amend object.txt
# or limits.txt.)

# File: ego_item.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/ego_item.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "ego-item" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/ego_item.raw" file.

# The ego-item indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed
# or savefile compatibility will be lost.

# Note that several "ego-item" types may share the same "textual name",
# such as with "Armor of Resistance" and "Shield of Resistance".

# === Understanding ego_item.txt ===

# N: serial number : ego type
# X: rating : xtra
# C: max to-hit : max to-dam : max to-ac : pval
# W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
# T: tval : min_sval : max_sval
# F: flag | flag | etc

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'X' is for extra information - Rating affects level feelings.
# The xtra value determines random extra flags for the ego-item.
# Nothing happens with a value of 0, 1 stands for "one random extra
# sustain", 2 is "one random extra resist", and 3 is "one random
# extra ability".

# 'C' is for creation bonusses - maximum to-hit, to-dam, to-ac, and
# pval. Cursed ego-items will negate the given value.

# 'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is
# normally found at, rarity determines how common the object is,
# weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the items value.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'T' is for possible 'tval' and 'sval' values of the base-item.
# Up to three 'T' entries are possible for a single object. The
# ego-item can only be generated from items of this tval, with sval
# in the specified range.



# === Understanding object.txt ===

# N: serial number : & object name~
# G: symbol : color
# I: tval : sval : pval
# W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
# P: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
# A: depth/rarity : depth/rarity : etc
# C: charges
# M: chance of being generated in a pile : dice for number of items
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. The '&' and '~' symbols are use to
# include articles and pluralization as necessary to ensure
# grammatical correctness in object descriptions.
#
# For non-English and irregular plurals, the '|' symbol may be used
# instead, as in "|singular|plural|". The part between the first and
# second | symbol is used for singular, and the part between the second
# and third | for plural.  The number of | symbols in the name must
# always be a multiple of 3.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 15 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# W - Light Gray   v - Violet         y - Yellow        R - Light Red
# G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Brown
# Another color, "d", is used for "flavoured" items.

# 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
# sval identifies the subtype and the pval indicates the amount of
# effect the item has, if applicable (a fixed value: variable pvals
# are currently hard-coded.) 

# 'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is normally
# found at (and defines what "level" the object is, when determining how easy 
# it is to use a wand, staff or rod, rarity determines how common the object
# is (currently unused, thanks to the A: allocation lines), weight is in
# tenth-pounds and cost is the item's base value.

# 'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base
# damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac (assuming the latter 
# three numbers to be fixed: variable bonuses must be hard-coded.)

# 'A' is for allocation - depth and rarity, in pairs. This allows an
# item to have multiple natural depths and rarities. It is used to
# ensure that certain vital items such as food and identify scrolls
# are found throughout the dungeon. The "allocation" depth need not
# match the depth as specified in the "W:" line.

# 'C' is for charges (wands and staves only).  It specifies, in the form x+ydz,
# the number of charges a wand or staff should have on creation.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the object. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.

suggestions:

Axe of Gimli, Merry's Dagger of Westernesse
Dagmor be more powerful if it cut a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown? and shouldn't the Spear of Melkor be a bit more powerful if wielded by one of the most powerful of the Ainur
Dragon Helm of Dor-Lomin

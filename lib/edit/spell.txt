N:452:Become Lich
I:95:8:8
D:Actually becoming a lich is a difficult enough spell, but if you did that
D: you'd have to commit suicide or have someone kill you in the process,
D: ending the game.  This is an even rarer and more difficult spell, which
D: temporarily makes you seem undead, banishing the life from your body
D: in a way that will make it come back after a while.  There are several
D: effects of this which include: curing when first cast, resistance to
D: fear, charm, dark, and nether, and immunity to cold, increases
D: infravision by 30 feet (3 spaces).  Drawbacks include: taking extra
D: damage from light attacks, aggravation of animals and creatures of light,
D: cancellation of temporary fire resistance, chance of drained luck,
D: wisdom or charisma when first cast, and halved hp regeneration rate.
D: (creatures of light include light fairies ("y" monsters), zhelung lizards,
D: most unicorns, and tree monsters.)

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/spell.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "spell" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/ego_item.raw" file.

# The spell indexes are defined in "x-spell.c", and must not be changed
# or savefile compatibility will be lost.

# Note that several "spell" types may share the same "textual name".
# For example, the spell "Detect Monsters" appears in both a mage
# book and a priest book; some curing spells appear in two seperate
# priest books (and might not even have the exact same effect!)

# D: description
# W: who can cast this

# T: Type (category)
# C: max 8 char(s):color
# F: flags

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new spell.

# 'I' is for basic information. level indicates how high a level the
# character needs to be to cast it, mana is the MP needed to cast
# chance is the initial failure chance, minfail is the minimum failure
# chance.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the spell. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.

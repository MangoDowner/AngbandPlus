# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/uniq_art.raw" file, which
# is used to initialize the "uniques' artifacts" information for the Angband game.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/uniq_art.raw" file.

# N: serial number : item name (full, e.g. "Dragon Scale Mail of Glaurung")
# I: tval : sval : pval
# W: level : weight : cost
# P: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
# F: flag | flag | etc
# A: activation : recharge time : recharge time dice

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
# sval identifies the subtype and the pval indicates the amount of
# effect the item has, if applicable.

# 'W' is for extra information. Level is used mainly for activation.
# Weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value.

# 'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base
# damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'A' is for activation.  Activation is the effect the artifact
# activates for. The recharge time calculates from the recharge time
# plus a random value between 1 and the recharge time dice (if not 0).
# If an activation is given then the artifact must also have the
# ACTIVATE flag.

### IMPORTANT NOTES ###
# Due to the way in which "unique artifacts" are handled, only changing
# names, descriptions, costs or activations will have any effect on already
# generated objects. Removing entries may mess things somewhat.

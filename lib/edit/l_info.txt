# l_info.txt - Special Level Information File
# v1.01

# This file is used to set up special levels.  These can include monster
# lair levels, or any other special levels that can be generated, but
# need specific information to be properly set up.

# === Understanding l_info.txt ===

#
# 'N' Lists the Index number and name of the special level.
#
# 'D' Special feeling for this type of level.
#
# 'R' Basic level, room and floor layout.
# floor types - NORMAL, makes a normal random generated level
#             - OPEN, normal open level area, large open spaces with rooms
#             - ARENA, arena type levels
#             - BARE, only outer walls exists with no inner structures
#               at all
# max size    - NORMAL, generates normal random method
#             - SMALL
#             - MEDIUM
#             - LARGE
#             - MAXIMUM
#
# 'W' wall and floor flags, are set as a multi part section one
# per line, normally very few of these are set since it is used
# to make specific levels full or having large amounts of a specific
# terrain type or to make certain that specific wall sections show up.
# Wall and floor flags use a multi flag setting the first is type, the
# second is percent chance, and the third is placement method. The types
# are listed below as Wall Flags, and Floor Flags.  The chance is one
# of two methods.  If the place method is random than any of that type
# Wall or Floor, has chance% of becoming that type of terrain.  If the
# place method is anything else it is a % chance per tile (using the
# 'L'ook command) that that type of pattern will show up, and patterns can
# merge or overlay others.

Q:12:T:This is it. The time has come for you to put an end to all the
Q:12:T:troubles of the world. You must reach the last level of the
Q:12:T:dungeon and kill Variaz, the mighty god of the Void! He is the
Q:12:T:source of all problems and it's him who transformed the world
Q:12:T:into a world full of monsters. However, how can you defeat
Q:12:T:someone who can't be killed by a mortal...perhaps you're not
Q:12:T:just a mere mortal after all? If so, prove it! Good luck!!

Q:24:T:A priest of Variaz came to this city. We tried to stop him,  
Q:24:T:but in vain. His powers are strange. We have never seen a  
Q:24:T:priest with such powers. Our spies report that the priest 
Q:24:T:is hidden in a cave, near the town hall. By all means,
Q:24:T:adventurer, get rid of this evil man!

Q:24:T:So you did it? Really? WOW! I never expected a priest of

Q:24:T:may be the one who will save us from Variaz!

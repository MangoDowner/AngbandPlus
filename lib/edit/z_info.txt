# maximum number of objects on the level
# Increasing this can prevent or delay object loss associated with the
# "Compacting objects..." message.

# maximum number of monsters on the level
# Increasing this can prevent or delay monster loss associated with the
# "Compacting monster..." message.
M:M:1024

# maximum length of object description
# Increasing this can prevent incomplete object description strings from being
# generated (e.g. "A Weapon with a very long name (2d4) (+13,+").
M:B:120

# maximum length of monster description
# Increasing this can prevent incomplete monster description strings from being
# generated (e.g. "The Monster with a very long n").
M:D:80

# delay between auto-roller iterations
# Increasing this makes generating a character via "use_autoroller" slower
# by a delay measured in milliseconds. It also decreases the load the game
# puts on the processor during that period.

# array sizes (in bytes) for some initialization stuff

# These can be increased if an "out of memory" error is given during
# initialisation, but increasing them above 65535 may prevent the game
# from running on some 16 bit computers.

# This is, in fact, already necessary for the r_info array.

# maximum size of the array in which most of the information for monsters,
# objects, features, etc., is stored

# size of the "fake" array for reading in the descriptions of monsters,

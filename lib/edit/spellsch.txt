		Wizardry will be mostly same as in V (realm 0)
except Wizard lock in 1st spellbook

and Tenser's Transformations renamed to Enchantments Of War (mostly not for wizard)
and instead of greater recharging it would have:
mana bolt
molten lightning (plasma beam)
tsunami
elemental brand ammo becomes elemental brand melee
greater recharging added to Kelek's

note: when doing formulas for an integer, C always rounds down
 (when it's a positive number).

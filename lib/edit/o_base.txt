# File: o_base.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/o_base.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "object base" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/o_base.raw" file.

# === Understanding o_base.txt ===

# N: p_id : name
# C: cost

# M: old p_id : new p_id

# All entries must begin with the 'N' line.

# The "p_id" is the p_id of those items in o_unid.txt which
# use this base entry.

# The "name" is the name which objects with this p_id usually have.
# The syntax it takes is described in detail in o_unid.txt.

# The "cost" is the price which a shopkeeper will offer for an unknown
# object with this p_id.

# The 'M' field defines a completely separate object in itself. This object,
# which has a p_id of "new p_id", shares exactly the features of the object
# with a p_id of "old p_id".

# File: q_info.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/q_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "quest" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/q_info.raw" file.

# Note that changes to this file will only be relevent to new characters - old
# savefiles will either be broken (if the number of quests changes), or will still
# use the old quest information.

# Format:
# N:<quest index>:<quest name>
# W:<level>:<monster>:<number>

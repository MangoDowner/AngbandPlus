#  Spell Realm Data
#
#
#  RandomBand will use a generic Build Your Own Spell Book System
#  which will allow a player to add a total of 32 spells per realm
#  to a spell list while making the spell books any way they want too.
#  spells are normally gained going up in levels, however, alternate
#  meathods, such as finding an existing spell book are available too.
#
#
#  Realm Data
#
#  Total Number of spells learnable is hard coded 40 for general and 32
#  for all others.
#
# N: serial number | Realm Name
# M: Max Spell Level
# B: Bonus Power  (for single realm will be 1/2 for two realms)
# E: Effect modifier for use with each other realm
#
# E: General:Life:Death:Sorcery:Nature:Trump:Chaos:Arcane:Chi:Elemental
#
#
# Very simply stated when general magic is used with any other realm
# the effectiveness of both realms is only 75% normal.  Other than the
# Life Death realm combo, this is the worst.  The penalties % is added
# together for all known realms.  So technically you can use all 9
# normal realms, however, you would be at a 90% defficiency on most
# and even worse on life & death magic.
#
# Example a PC with Life, Trump, Nature would be...
# Life = 0(life) + -20(trump) + -20(nature) = -40% eff +40% cost
# Which means all life spells cost 40% more to cast and are 40% more
# likely to fail and the effects *may* be reduced by 40%.
#
# This is done to keep casters from getting too powerful.

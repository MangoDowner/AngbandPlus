# File: d_info.txt

# This file is used to initialise the "lib/data/d_quest.raw",
# "lib/data/d_dun.raw" and "lib/data/d_town.raw" files, which are used to
# initialise the towns, dungeons and fixed quests for the sCthAngband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# The format of a monster is as follows... ([] indicates an optional part)

# N:(symbol):(dungeon name)
# D:(dungeon description)
# I:(minimum level)-(maximum level):[Bias]
# Q:level:number:monster
# T:house price:town description
# S:[shop]:[shop]:[shop]:...
# F:flag | flag | ...

# A town (with walls) is generated if a T line exists.

# 'N'
# Symbol: A symbol used to represent this dungeon on the small scale map.
# Dungeon name: A short name for the dungeon, primarily used for the "level"
#     display within towns, but sometimes used for all dungeons.

# 'D'
# Dungeon description: A long description for the dungeon, printed on entering
#     the dungeon.

# 'I'
# Minimum/Maximum level: The range of levels over which this dungeon is spread.
# Bias: A special restriction which is placed on monster creation approximately
#     30% of the time. If the game cannot create such a monster (e.g. because
# it is too out of depth), nothing is created. It can be any of the following:
# CTHULOID, DEMON, UNDEAD, DRAGON, GREAT_OLD_ONE, ORC, ANIMAL, UNIQUE:
#     Creates monsters with the given flag.
# HI_DEMON: Creates demons with the L, V or W symbol.
# HOUND: Creates monsters with the C or Z symbol.
# MIMIC: Creates monsters with the !, ?, =, $ or | symbol.
# ANIMAL_RANGER: Creates animals which have no spells, are not evil, draconic,
# undead, demoniac or Cthuloid and have a, b, c, f, l, q, r, w, B, C, I, J, K,
# M, N, R or S as their symbol.
# REAVER: Creates monsters with "Black reaver" in their names.
# PHANTOM: Creates monsters with "Phantom" in their names.
# ELEMENTAL: Creates monsters with "lemental" in their names.
# An arbitrary single character: Creates monsters with the indicated symbol.

# 'Q'
# level: The level on which a fixed dungeon quest occurs.
# number: The number of monsters to create at this level.
# monster: The name of the monster to be created.

# 'T'
# House price: The price of the house in this town. If no house is for sale,
#     this is ignored (but must still be provided).
# Town description: A long description for a town, printed on entering or
#     leaving a town.

# S
# shop: A type of shop present in this town from the following list:
# GENERAL, ARMOURY, WEAPON, TEMPLE, ALCHEMIST, MAGIC, BLACK, HOME, LIBRARY,
# INN, HALL, PAWN.
# There can be at most 12 shops in a single town, and at most one home.

# F contains a number of flags as follows:
# TOWER: This indicates that any stairs placed here lead to a tower rather
# than a dungeon. Towers are harder at higher levels rather than lower ones,
# consist entirely of 1x1 levels and start at a round building rather than a
# set of stairs leading into the ground. Towers cannot exist in towns.
# START: This allows the player to start the game in this town (or dungeon).
# KADATH: This causes monsters generated on the surface to have a Cthuloid
# bias rather than following the bias of the dungeon.
# NO_UNIQUES: This prevents uniques from being generated when the game creates
# a monster according to the above bias.

# Some of the changes which can be made to this file (including all changes
# relating to quests apart from removing the level a quest is on) only have
# an effect at the start of the next game, or have a strange effect mid-game.
# Because of this, you are strongly advised to keep a copy of your savefile
# somewhere safe if you do intend to alter this file mid-game.

# Version stamp (required)

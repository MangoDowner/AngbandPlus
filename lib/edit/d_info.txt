# Dungeon name describes the type of dungeon, e.g. "Tower" or "Clearing"

# O: is for "object theme".  Assign 4 numbers; the implicit 5th is for junk.
#    This specifies the relative frequency of each type of object in the 
#    dungeon.  

# B: is for "bounds".  Specify the minimum and maximum level for this 
#    dungeon type.

# W: is for "wilderness."  Population and height indicate targets for these
#    values.  A high population will make the dungeon more likely in 
#    populated areas, etc.

# P: is for "probabilities."  These default to 100; with lower values, 
#    the feature type described is skipped if a d100 roll exceeds the
#    value.  Not all fields required.

# V: is for "veins," R: is for "rivers", and L: is for "lakes."  For each
#    of these, specify a feature or liquid type that makes up the 
#    feature, a rarity (out of 100), and a size.

# T: is for terrain.  Specify the feature for the floor, wall, and permanent wall.

# H: is for habitat.  Specify dungeon habitats used for the dungeon.

# F: is for extra flags.

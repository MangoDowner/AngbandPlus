# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/d_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "dungeon type" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/d_info.raw" file.

# The dungeon type indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be
# changed.

# N:<index>:<name>
# D:<long name>
# W:<min depth>:<min depth>:<min player level>:<next dungeon>:<flags mode>:<min alloc>:<max alloc chance>

# Note on the MONSTER_PERCENT_ dungeon flag
# It defines the percentage of monsters affected by the restrictions
# so MONSTER_PERCENT_70 will create 70% of restricted monsters and 30%
# of absulutly random monsters.
# by default MONSTER_PERCENT_ is 0%

# Note for <flags mode> :
# 0 = No restriction
# 1 = AND
# 2 = NAND
# 3 = OR
# 4 = NOR

# Version stamp (required)

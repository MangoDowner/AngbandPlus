# File: r_info.txt
# For NTAngband 0.4

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file.

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# floors, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# CHAR_MULTI monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# objects, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# In several situations, two or more monsters with identical symbols and
# colors were changed so that maximal information is conveyed by the symbol
# and color.

# The "0" and "9" symbols are reserved for internal debugging use.

# The "`" symbol is reserved as an "alternate" open door picture, since
# the "'" symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts (esp. IBM).

# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# As always, you can enforce any "visual picture" you want with a "pref file".


###### Understanding the entries ######

# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
# W: depth : rarity : corpse weight : experience for kill
# E: weapons : torso : arms : finger : head : leg
# O: treasure : combat : magic : tool
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# F: flag | flag | etc
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
#     armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
#     from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
#     intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, corpse weight (expressed
#     in deci-pounds) [19 deci-pounds seem to get added to these number
#     in practice], and experience for killing.

# 'E' is for equipment slots - weapon slots, torso slots (the "on body"
#     and "about body" equipment slots), arm slots (expressed in number
#     of pairs), finger slots, head slots, and leg slots (expressed
#     in number of pairs).

# 'O' is for object drop chances - % chance to drop treasure, % chance
#     to drop combat items, % chance to drop magic type items (not 
#     items of good blessing), and % chance to drop tools.  The four 
#     percents added together must be equal to or less than 100.  If
#     the percent is less than 100, that is the chance for the monster
#     to drop junk.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
#     from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
#     damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
#     number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
#     one of its spells. X must not be zero.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
#     lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
#     are separated by the '|' symbol. The '|' symbol must also be used
#     to end all but the last line.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
#     to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
#     ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.


# Note that monster zero is used for the "player" picture.

# '&' is now the symbol for balrogs.  Note that fountains are always bluish,
# while balrogs are reddish or umber.

# If you wish to add separate monsters for a specific dungeon, 
# make a monster list as usual, but make sure that their serial numbers
# are greater than 510.  Then, append it to this file.

D:He is the high-captain of Angband, and so he is second only to
D:his father in combat and command.  He has slain Feanor, Fingon, and
D:Ecthelion, and soon, he will add you to the list.  His vast wings
D:obliterate the light around you, and he wields his two mighty 
D:weapons (his whip and his axe) with devastating skill.  You can 
D:feel his approach as his massive feet tread menacingly in your direction.

D:Morgoth's second-in-command, he is mighty in magic.  He knows much

D:The beginning of all evil stares down at you contemptuously
D:as you stagger back in fright. 
D:He was the most powerful of the Valar, the equal of Manwe. 
D:Master of the Pits of Angband; his figure is like a black 
D:tower crowned with lightning. He rages with everlasting anger, his 
D:body scarred by Fingolfin's seven mighty wounds. He can never rest from 
D:his pain, but seeks forever to dominate all that is light and good in the 
D:world. He is the origin of man's fear of darkness and created many foul 
D:creatures with his evil powers. Orcs, Dragons, and Trolls are his most 
D:foul corruptions, causing much pain and suffering in the world to please 
D:him. His disgusting visage, twisted with evil, is crowned with iron, the 
D:two remaining Silmarils forever burning him. Grond, the mighty Hammer of 
D:the Underworld, cries defiance as he limps toward you to crush you to a 
D:pulp!

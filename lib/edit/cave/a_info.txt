# File: a_info.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/a_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "artifact" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/a_info.raw" file.


# The artifact indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed.

# Artifacts 1-15 are "special", 16-63 are "armor", and 64-127 are "weapons".

# Hack -- "Grond" and "Morgoth" MUST have a rarity of one, or they might
# not be dropped when Morgoth is killed.  Note that they, like the "special"
# artifacts, are never created "accidentally".

# Artifacts now have descriptions.  Special thanks to J.R.R Tolkien, 
# without whom the words would be unwritten, the images unconceived, 
# the deed undone.

D:A largish crown of cheap gilded metal, studded with several paste gems: 
D:rhinestones, false pearls, and a dozen red heart-shaped crystals.  Its magic 
D:is very real and powerful, though:  whoever wears the crown feels warm and 
D:secure, able to befriend other creatures easily.

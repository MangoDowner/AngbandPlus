# Portralis skills definitions.
# Skills needs to be coded in the scripts if you add one.
# Because theremay be some hard-coded parts, it's better to not
# delete the default skills. You can rename them if you wish though.
# Maximum skills is 50.

# IMPORTANT NOTE!!
# When using the skills in scripts, always add 1 to the skill's id!
# For example, Fighting is skill number 1 in the scripts, even if it
# is defined as 0 here.

# A skill's name should be 14 characters long. Add spaces if needed.
# Also, the skills id should be in sequencial order, from 0 to whatever
# number of skills you want.

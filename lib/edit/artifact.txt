# File: artifact.txt
# for DaJAngband 1.3.0

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/artifact.raw" file, which
# is used to initialize the "artifact" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/artifact.raw" file.

# The artifact indexes are defined in "defines.h", and must not be changed.

# Hack -- "Grond" and "Morgoth" MUST have a rarity of one, or they might
# not be dropped when Morgoth is killed.  Note that they, like the "special"
# artifacts, are never created "accidentally".

# === Understanding artifact.txt ===

# N: serial number : item name
# I: tval : sval : pval : rating : esprace
# W: depth : max depth : rarity : weight : cost
# P: base armor class : base damage : plus to-hit : plus to-dam : plus to-ac
# F: flag | flag | etc
# A: activation : recharge time : recharge time dice
# D: description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
# sval identifies the subtype and the pval indicates the amount of
# effect the item has, if applicable.
#   New: Each artifact now has its own rating (like ego types do), so
# Narya or Ringil will give a significantly higher level rating than
# Narthanc or Cammithrim.
#   esprace is a code for items which have race-specific ESP, like this:
# 0-none, 1=orcs, 2=trolls, 3=giants, 4=undead, 5=dragons, 6=demons
# 7=light fairies, 8=bugs, 9=grepse (silver monsters), 12=dwarves..
# 70 = short ranged 'ESP' for everything (even mindless monsters)

# 'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is
# normally found at, rarity determines how common the object is,
# weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value.

# New: Artifacts will never be created deeper than their max depth.
# Maximum max depth is 127.  Max depth does not apply to randarts.

# 'P' is for power information. The items base armor class, its base
# damage and pluses to-hit, to-dam and to-ac.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'A' is for activation.  Activation is the effect the artifact
# activates for. The recharge time calculates from the recharge time
# plus a random value between 1 and the recharge time dice (if not 0).
# If an activation is given then the artifact must also have the
# ACTIVATE flag.
# Activation times are now shown to the player in minutes, so prefer to
# have them in multiples of 6.

# 'D' is for the artifact description.  These appear when the item is 
# identified.  Special thanks to J.R.R Tolkien, without whom the words would
# be unwritten, the images unconceived, the deed undone. -LM-

### IMPORTANT NOTES ###
# (1.) Any changes or additions to the file will have influence on randarts
# and may break savefile compatibility for old savegames with randarts.  If
# using random artifacts, finish your existing game before making any
# changes to the artifact.txt file at all.
# (2.) Removing any artifact, or changing its "base" type (as defined by
# the tval and sval entries in the "I:" line), will break savefile
# compatibility for ALL savefiles.
# (3.) Adding a new artifact, or changing the powers of existing ones, will
# NOT affect savefile compatibility for games with the standard artifact set:
# it is perfectly safe to do this. (If your new artifact is a new kind of
# object, or a new one at the end of the file, you must also amend object.txt
# or limits.txt.)

# currently no artifact has the TELE_AWAY activation.
# also, there should probably be some artifact with THROWMULT
# (there is one, but it's rare, obscure, and not that great)

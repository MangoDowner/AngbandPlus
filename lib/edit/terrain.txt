# 0x7* Special features

N:112:lava
G:#:r
F:TF_LOS | TF_PROJECT | TF_PASSABLE | TF_NO_SCENT
D:Can be passed by any character, but inflicts substantial fire damage (less 
D:for players with feather fall - they're light on their feet).  All monsters 
D:other than fiery or strong flying creatures will not cross.  Water and 
D:cold-based spells suffer and fire-based spells become more powerful against 
D:a target in lava.  Lava may freeze to rubble or normal floor.

N:113:water
G:.:b
F:TF_LOS | TF_PROJECT | TF_PASSABLE | TF_NO_SCENT 
D:Cannot be passed by fiery, earthbound monsters, slows down most other 
D:monsters.  Slows you down if you are carrying too much.  You and your 
D:enemies are easier to hit when in water, and most spells (especially 
D:water-based ones) gain in strength.  It is hard to dodge in water.  However, 
D:fire-based spells become much less powerful, so find a lake if you battle 
D:Smaug.  Water may evaporate.

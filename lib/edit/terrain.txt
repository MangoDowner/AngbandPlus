# File: terrain.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/terrain.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "terrain feature" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Note that the terrain feature are grouped into very regular groups,
# such that each of the bits in the feature type conveys information.

# Note that terrain feature zero contains the "darkness" picture.

# Base Random Monster Information - TYPES
#

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.

# CHAR_MIMIC monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.
# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently CHAR_CLEAR monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# CHAR_MIMIC monsters a special-cased in the targetting code.  They can not
# be looked at or targetted unless 'noticed'.  The monster-list code also
# handles this flag.

# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
# W: depth : rarity : unique name list : experience for kill
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Dark Purple    v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing.  3rd value is now for monster unique list.  0 means there
# will be no uniques of that type.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'O' is for object theme.  The three numbers represent the percent
# chance to drop treasure, combat and magic items.  The chance to
# drop tools is defined as 100 - the sum of these three numbers.
# Note that monsters do not drop junk.  Junk can only be generated
# in the dungeon when you enter it.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
# number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
# one of its spells. X must not be zero.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

#
# RandomBand uses JOB, DESC, and COLOR for Job, Descriptor and Color
# setting flags.
# JOB - Can have an occupation (most the major races like orcs and trolls)
# DESC - Can have a descriptor
#        DESC_T - Town
#        DESC_1 - 1 Descriptor Max (ex., Ancient, Quick, Slimy)
#        DESC_2 - 2 Descriptors Max (ex., Quick Ancient, Young Slimy)
# COLOR - Can have a color descriptor (ex. Red, Blue, Green)
#
# Having a COLOR flag pretty much gaurantees a COLOR will be assigned
# descriptors CAN be assigned (and usually are) but aren't 100% for
# certain.
#

#
# NEGATIVE flag means to reduce the base by that much, if the type
# doesn't have a NEGATIVE flag it will add that % to the base.
#

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.

# Version stamp (required)

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/limits.raw" file, which is

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/data/limits.raw" file.

# Note: some of these are actually set to values higher than the actual
# maximums, so that I don't have to re-update this file each time I add
# something. This may lead to some memory overhead.

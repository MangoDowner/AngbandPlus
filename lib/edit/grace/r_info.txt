# File: r_info.txt
# For NTAngband 0.6

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file.

# PernAngband notes:

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window. See "cave.c" for info.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# floors, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# CHAR_MULTI monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window. In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# objects, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# Note that the monster list underwent several changes for Angband 2.7.9,
# including some monster name changes, some symbol redistributions, and
# some color changes.

# Some of the old "red" or "brown" monsters became "pink" if they lower
# strength, while some of the old "fire" monsters became simply "red"
# monsters. The "dragons" and "hounds" and related monsters underwent
# a "color scheme regularization" ('w' = White/Cold, 's' = Black/Acid,
# 'o' = Lite/Dark, 'r' = Red/Fire, 'g' = Green/Poison, 'b' = Blue/Elec,
# 'u' = Brown/Earth/Force, 'D' = Dark/etc, 'W' = Stone/Inertia/Gravity/etc,
# 'v' = Multihued/Chaos/Disenchantment/etc, 'y' = Gold/Sound, 'R' = Nexus,
# 'G' = Nether, 'B' = Left-overs, and 'U' = Bronze/Confusion).

# In several situations, two or more monsters with identical symbols and
# colors were changed so that maximal information is conveyed by the symbol
# and color.

# The "people" (p), with more than 50 entries, got a new "color scheme"
# ('w' = Paladin, 's' = Knight, 'o' = Mystic, 'r' = Mage, 'g' = High Priest,
# 'b' = Thief, 'u' = Warrior, 'D' = Death knight, 'W' = Ranger/Archer,
# 'v' = Sorcerer, 'y' = Ninja, 'R' = High Mage, 'G' = Priest, 'B' = High
# Thief, 'U' = High Warrior). Note that most non-unique "people" already
# had these colors, or colors close to these colors. A similar color scheme
# was enforced for the "humanoid" (h) monsters as well, more or less.

# TY: This is no longer entirely accurate. The monster coloring has been
# changed 'back' to pre-2.7.* coloring in several cases. For example, I
# prefer "black" thief characters. Also color can be (and should) be used to
# convey information, but more importantly it is a visual presentation
# of the creature and should be what the creature "looks" like.

# Mushrooms look just like food (and use the "," symbol for both the recall
# window and for normal display), Creeping coins look just like coins (and
# use the "$" symbol for both the recall window and for normal display), and
# Trappers/Lurkers can never be seen (and use the "." symbol for the recall
# window). All other monsters use "alphabetic" symbols, and "alphabetic"
# symbols are used only for monsters.

# The "0" and "9" symbols are reserved for internal debugging use.

# The "&" symbol is reserved for future use as a special "terrain feature".

# The "`" symbol is reserved as an "alternate" open door picture, since
# the "'" symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts (esp. IBM).

# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# There are still too many "p" monsters, perhaps they should be broken up.

# As always, you can enforce any "visual picture" you want with a "pref file".


###### Understanding the entries ######

# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
# W: depth : rarity : corpse weight : experience for kill
# E: weapons : torso : arms : finger : head : leg
# O: treasure : combat : magic : tool
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# F: flag | flag | etc
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
#     armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
#     from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
#     intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, corpse weight (expressed
#     in deci-pounds) [19 deci-pounds seem to get added to these number
#     in practice], and experience for killing.

# 'E' is for equipment slots - weapon slots, torso slots (the "on body"
#     and "about body" equipment slots), arm slots (expressed in number
#     of pairs), finger slots, head slots, and leg slots (expressed
#     in number of pairs).

# 'O' is for object drop chances - % chance to drop treasure, % chance
#     to drop combat items, % chance to drop magic type items (not 
#     items of good blessing), and % chance to drop tools.  The four 
#     percents added together must be equal to or less than 100.  If
#     the percent is less than 100, that is the chance for the monster
#     to drop junk.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
#     from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
#     damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X with X the
#     number of monster turns, on average, before the monster will cast
#     one of its spells. X must not be zero.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
#     lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
#     are separated by the '|' symbol. The '|' symbol must also be used
#     to end all but the last line.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
#     to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
#     ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.


# Note that monster zero is used for the "player" picture.

# If you wish to add separate monsters for a specific dungeon, 
# make a monster list as usual, but make sure that their serial numbers
# are greater than 510.  Then, append it to this file.

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/data/p_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "class" information for the EyAngband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Format:
# N:class number:class name
# S:str:int:wis:dex:con:chr
# C:dis:dev:sav:stl:srh:fos:thn:thb:tht:dig:alc 
# X:dis:dev:sav:stl:srh:fos:thn:thb:tht:dig:alc
# I:hitdie:expbase:attackmax:minweight:multiplier:spellstat1:spellstat2:disturbweight
# B:sval:handicap
# E:tval:sval:min:max - starting equipment, up to 4 entries per class
# T:class titles - there must be exactly 10 of these per class
# F:class flags 

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item.

# 'S' Is the stat modifiers for the class, applied during class creation.

# 'C' and 'X' are the skill lines - 'C' represents the basic class skill, and 'X' 
# is the amount of skill gained every 10 levels.

# 'I' is class info. Hitdie and Expbase are modified according to race. Attackmax is the 
# maximum amount of attacks acheivable by a member of this class. Minweight and multiplier
# determine that calculation of attack number; minweight determines the lowest possible 
# weight the class can get benifits for (if your minweight is 10 then a weapon that weighs
# 4 is the same as a weapon that weighs 10). The higher the multiplier is, the more attacks
# you are likely to get. The two spellstats are  the index number of the stats (0 = STR,
# 1 = INT, 2 = WIS, 3 = DEX, 4 = CON, 5 = CHR) used for mana and fail rate calculations -
# the actual figure used is the average of the two stats, use the same stat twice if 
# only one stat has effect. Disturbweight is the maximum weight the character can wear
# without losing mana.

# 'B' is for spell book allowances. You must list the sval of the book, and its handicap.

# 'E' lines are for equipment - you can have 0-4 of these lines. Tval and Sval determine
# which object will be generated, and min and max determine the possible quantity of the 
# item with which the character shall begin.

# 'T' lines determine the class titles - the number of lines does not make a difference 
# but there must be exactly 10 titles in all divided between them. The titles are seperated
# by the '|' symbol.

# 'F' is for flags. As many F: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags
# and flags are separated by the '|' symbol. The current possible flags are:
#
# PSEUDO_IDn - Where n is a value between 1 to 5. The higher n is, the faster the pseudo 
# id.
# PSEDUO_ID_HEAVY - If a class has this flag it gets the "heavy" (more detailed) pseudo ID.
# EXTRA_SHOT - The character shall gain extra shots at higher levels.
# RES_FEAR_30 - The character shall gain resist fear at level 30.
# NO_GLOVE - Spellcasting skills are reduced by wearing gloves.
# BLESS_WEAPON - The character's spellcasting skill is reduced by using non-hafted, 
# non-blessed weapons. Also, the character will get a more powerful orb of destruction.
# CHOOSE_SPELLS - Allows the character to choose which spell to learn.
# ZERO_FAIL - The character can reach a 0% fail rate for spells. Without this, fail rate
# is determined by the relevant realm's handicap.
# BEAM - The character's bolt spells have a higher chance of beaming.
# POWER - The character's spells will be more powerful.
# EXTRA_MANA - The character gets 1.5 times as much mana as without this flag.
# EXTRA_SPELL - The character gains spells faster.
# MYSTIC_CAST - Allows the character to cast spells from the mystic spellbooks even 
# when blinded or confused.

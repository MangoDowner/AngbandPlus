- Sil 1.0.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- linux version
	- X11, GCU & CAP should work now
		- GCU & CAP are fairly unplayable though (mainly due to lack of decent colours)

	- fixed colours for X11 (no more green dungeon walls!)

- Sil 1.0.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- interface
	- corrected the keypad in the (?) screen
	- made Angband-like keyset use (+) instead of (/)
	- brought back the (M) map command due to popular request
	- using torches and lanterns now refuels your current one by default (if you are already wielding one)
		- if you want to swap torches/lanterns, just remove the existing one first
		- it now warns you about overfueling

- display
	- added a 'Score' line to the character dumps to help with the Angband ladder
	- made the combat rolls window more compact and more flexible
	- removed monster health, alertness and morale info for the target if out of sight
	- fixed display of "Mindless"
	- fixed display of hits doing 10 damage
	- stopped printing an empty description for one handed weapons
	- added weights of weapons to character dumps
	- fixed display of dates
	- now shows artefacts' abilities in the Artefact info screen

		- but *also* shows the level it was found on if that was different
	- no longer tells you that you didn't enter a greater vault if you didn't discover the vault
		- but you still can never find that vault again
	- now displays the correct depth for the note about missing a greater vault
		- instead of the new depth you went to from that level
	- adds a small screenshot to character dumps for dead characters

- potion of true sight now gives (temporary) resistance to blindness

- reduced the Will of cat-type creatures
	- making them more vulnerable to being put to sleep/terrified

- abilities
	- fixed the second prerequisite for Strength (to Knock Back)
	- made the Song of Aule cost only 1/3 of a point of voice per turn
	- the Song of Freedom now disarms and unlocks chests
	- the Song of Freedom now has all its difficulty levels in skill checks reduced by 5

- items
	- added Lesser Jewels
	- fixed a bug where items with different prot values could be stacked together
	- fixed a bug where weapons of Fury gave Knock Back instead of Whirlwind
		- and daggers of accompaniment gave Rapid Attack instead of Two Weapon Fighting
	- allows {special} items to stack before being identified if they have the same type
		- most useful for found stacks of {special} throwing items
	- staves of revelations now work in the Throne Room (if you get one there, good luck to you!)

- artefacts
	- some minor changes to rarity and to the artefacts themselves

- monsters
	- decreased the evasion of the Cat warrior family of creatures by a small amount

- traps
	- change "trap doors" to "false floors"
		- trap doors are a bit too comic in flavour
		- the effect is basically the same
		- tweaked to avoid ever killing characters with the damage

- staircases
	- no longer take 100 turns of food and game clock
	- the forcing downwards time limits still avoid the infinite levels problem
	- the 'stair-scumming' problem of going up and down repeatedly is now avoided with trapped stairs
	- trapped stairs
		- there is a chance that the stairs give way beneath you like a trap door / false floor
		- this chance is miniscule or even zero in normal play
		- but it goes up the more you use the stairs in quick succession
		- attempts to stairscum will quickly lead to being injured on a level with no escape 
		- we think this is pretty difficult to abuse..

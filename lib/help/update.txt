sCthangband
Based on Cthangband 4.1.0b and Zangband 2.1.0e

Changes are added to the top of this file, so for a chronological order
read from the bottom up.

sCthangband 1.0.16
* Fix the following bugs:
  * The game hung if it was started without an existing save file.
  * The keys for increasing stats during character creation were displayed
    wrongly.
  * Loading the "previous" set of stats in quick-start didn't work.

sCthangband 1.0.15
* Cause ball attacked aimed in a direction to only be stopped by a wall or a
  visible monster, and those aimed at a target to be stopped by a wall or the
  target.
* List the actual name of a hidden object when it is examined.
* Give a "Try" prompt when the player selects an object to sell with a capital.
* Allow an ego type to be selected when creating an object in wizard mode.
* Set the EASY_KNOW flag for non-random items in the source.
* Fix the following bugs:
  * It was possible to discover the identity of objects the player was not aware
    of using the preferences.
  * The unified use command allowed ineligible objects to be used.
  * Being cut or stunned had twice the intended chance of decreasing stats.
  * The maximum length of a ghost's name wasn't calculated correctly.
  * Loading a game which contains more monster races than the current r_info
    could cause undefined behaviour.
  * The labels in the extra inventory window were corrupted.
  * The damage from monster breaths was described incorrectly.
  * Ego boots, ego elven cloaks and weapons of Law were never created.
  * No template was given hermetic magic skills at start-up.
  * Objects generated in dungeons could have the wrong dungeon set.
  * Dying after recalling into a dungeon could attribute the death wrongly.

sCthangband 1.0.14
* Skill improvements become rarer, and then impossible, if the player does
  enough things without coming across a new object in the process.
* An inscription of (e.g.) ~vf on an object causes the "throw" command to 
  attempt to "fire" it instead.
* Selecting "z" at an object prompt only selects squelched objects.
* No feature can hide the player on the small scale map.
* No two features have the same priority for the small scale map.
* Objects can have default inscriptions which are given to identified items of
  that type, or to all similar unidentified items.
* Objects get a line in their "examine" text describing where they were found.
* The inscribe_depth option no longer exists.
* Names can be used for races, templates and sexes in initial stat dumps.
* Monster spoilers give as much information as monster memory.
* Player templates are defined in an external text file.

* Fix the following bugs:
  * The SUMMON_KIN flag created a lot of error messages but very little else.
  * Starting the game with -n gave too many quests.
  * Town monsters could be created elsewhere at level generation, and nothing
    could be produced in the town.
  * Birth options were set to the user-defined value inappropriately on loading.
  * Gaining a chaos power opposed to another not possessed gave an odd message.
  * Tried unaware objects never gained an inscription.
  * spoil_value always gave a value of 1 for unaware objects.
  * A few chaos powers allowed a target, but only understood directions.
  * Two directions were ignored when something looked to escape an earthquake.
  * Functions such as isdigit() and tolower() were called incorrectly.
  * Aborting an object prompt gave a "no objects" error message.
  * Non-fatal errors on loading gave a -more- prompt after the message had gone.
  * Incorrect monster indices, etc., in pref files may have caused inappropriate
    memory access.
  * The spirit display on the map screen was squashed and inverted, and wasn't
    redrawn when a new spirit was contacted.
  * Aggravate monster scrolls, and most other sources of aggravation, did not
    affect monster 1.

sCthangband 1.0.13
* Monsters do not recover from fear if they have too few HP to survive one of
  your past attacks on them.

  * Compiling with BCC still led to frequent crashes.
  * Characters could get a chaos power on creation if patrons were disabled.
  * Some indirect help commands did not restore the screen after they finished.
  * The find command in help often left the searched text off-screen.
  * The game claimed that the character gained a chaos feature it already had.
  * Mindflayers could gain tentacles by their mouths and lose them again from
    their sides.
  * skip_chaos_feature was always treated as being set.
  * The player could try to refuel a lamp with itself.
  * Messages given when destroying part of a stack referred to the total size.
  * C and c (and possibly A and a) didn't work correctly in the visual prefs.
  * Skeletons could multiply normal food by trying to eat some from a pile.

  * Vampiric weapons gave the player "too many" extra HP.
  * Most distance attacks which affect the floor type (e.g. destroy doors) did
    not do so.
  * Recalling into a dungeon and leaving via the stairs could leave you in the
    wrong town.
  * Stormbringer and the Hammer of Worlds had the wrong weapon skills.

  purposes based on how open the space around it is.
* Give the Boots of the Black Reaver a higher price than similar speed boots.
* Make the Lucerne Hammer a polearm which uses the stabbing skill to match the

  coloured *.
* Change the "change colour here" string in help files to $.
* Include pluralisation methods in lib/edit/r_info.txt.
* Replace the sval, level and (the unused) extra field from object_kind with
  an extra field which contains information which changes based on the tval
  (but is usually 0) and a second level field in artifact_type which is the
  second level field for insta-arts.

  files.
* Change "Armor" to "Armour" in various places for uniformity.
* Save a version string in pref files so that they can be imported into newer
  versions easily.
* Restrict the old rolling routine to quick_start.
* Suppress the "It modifies your number of blows by X." for weapons.
* Use store_table directly rather than giving each shop a copy of its section.
* Replace the various SV_* macros with OBJ_* ones based on index.
* Make the colour<=>character conversions use the same table.

sCthangband 1.0.4
* Allow 'a' to be used to roll for stats in spend_points display, taking the
  current stats for minima if use_autoroller is set. Separate rolling out into
  a separate function. Only use the old autoroller function for quick_start.
* Give a scroll_edge option which causes the screen to scroll until the
  detection radius reaches the corner of the map whatever the screen size.
* Calculate the maximum damage an uninjured monster can do via an unresisted
  breath in monster recall.
* Display the symbol used for a keymap trigger even if it has a separate text
  representation.

  MNAME_MAX.
* Add the inscription from both objects to the combined one if two objects
  with different inscriptions are merged and stack_force_notes_all is set.
* Allow some simple scripting when pre-parsing text files. Use this to remove
  some magic numbers from v_info.txt and make it easy to search based on
  dimensions.
* Also use the scripting to set tval-based flags.
* Add an o_base.txt file to contain the framework from which the names of
  objects created (e.g. "A ? potion of ?").
* Allow the format of ego items and artefacts to be set in their respective
  text files.
* Add object descriptions (based on those in Hengband) for various objects
  which wouldn't otherwise be described in k_info.txt to that file.
* Work out if an unaware object can be expected to have a flag in init1.c.
* Give resize hooks to do_cmd_store() and get_item(). Resizing in subsidiary
  prompts from the latter are not handled correctly at present, however.
* Create a logfile.txt file to list a summary for every game which is played
  in chronological order.
* Create a TR1_X15_DRAGON flag to replace the hard-coded flag on Lightning.
  This means that each object should only have one dragon slaying flag.
* Tell the player that objects with R_CHAOS have R_CONF.
* Add a somewhat accurate readme.txt, and make lib/file/readme! less ugly.
* Make graf-xxx.prf handle unidentified objects in a more normal way.
* Modify the code so that it compiles in MS VC++ (thanks to Iain Maclean for
  his help with this) and hopefully also other compilers.
* Add makefiles for bcc, cygwin (tested by Scott Holder) and lcc.
* Put main-ami.c in an #ifdef USE_AMI directive to prevent it from
  contaminating other systems.
* Clean up some code.
* Fix some bugs.

sCthangband 1.0.3
* Allow the map to be nearly as large as the main window, and the top line
  as long as space allows in many cases. Update the display as the screen is
  resized in a few cases.
* Make "use" print a list of cantrips for a charm rather than giving an error.
* If no missile weapon is equipped, the missile damage given on the character
  information screen is that of the first missile in the player's inventory
  enscribed with @ff, 0 if there are none.
* Replace the main-*.c files with versions based on those in Angband 3.0.0.
* Make the level generation loop a bit more efficient.
* Unify the initial help files, so that help.hlp is used on every system.
* Use a VARIABLE_ARRAYS macro to indicate whether it is safe to define an
  array the size of which is set at runtime. Use this in many places if it is,
  falling back to C_NEW() and C_FREE() otherwise.
* Fix a bug which prevented the "use racial/other powers" command from working
  (thanks to James Gordon for pointing it out).
* Fix a bug which caused objects to be incorrectly described as being bad for
  spellcasting/mindcraft.
* Fix a bug whereby objects were incorrectly marked as encumbering
  spells/mindcraft in identify_fully_aux().
* Always display the last message before leaving the level.
* Change k_ptr->d_char for flavoured items to ' ', so that they always use the
  flavour version of everything.
* Comment out unused features to prevent them from appearing in the
  preferences.
* Turn a couple of the long sections in play_game() into separate functions.
  Move the exit point in generate_cave() to the end of the loop. Also move the
  "give up on autoscum" check to the end of the generation loop, and move a
  few more things outside the loop.
* Fix a bug whereby items which affect strength didn't indicate an effect on
  how many blows the player had.
* Restore the commented sections of makefile.org I'd deleted.
  Make "make -f makefile.org clean" ignore any missing files.
  Add a (possibly working) makefile.cyg.
* Replace main.c and main-gcu.c with Angband 3.0.0 versions.
  Make the command line option loop a little clearer.
  Replace various main-*.c files with Angband 3.0.0 versions (untested).
* Use rtoa for everything in birth_choice(), so that the race choice is A-Z,
  0-3 everywhere.
* Remove all temporary buffers except "silly_name" from monster_desc().
* Fix a potentially fatal bug whereby the size of the object_desc() buffer
  wasn't fixed, and so the attempt to trim it to a length of ONAME_MAX could
  affect an arbitrary piece of memory.
* Replace the format() calls in object_desc() with a couple of local strings.
* Make object_desc() use a lower case "t" in "the".
* Fix a missing break; statement that caused a bug when the autosave options
  were used.
* Declare quark_str() to take a u16b, as that is what its input usually is.
* Optimise the "find useful ammunition" loop a bit.
* Remove the (now unused) strfmt function.
* Fix a mysterious bug whereby the boundary walls couldn't be targetted.
* Force the number of an entry in visual preferences to take up as much space
  as the last valid number.
* Reduce the number of macros and the amount of special case code from the
  visual preferences.
* Fix several other bugs and clean up various pieces of code.


sCthangband 1.0.2
* Call debug commands from process_command().
* Provide context-sensitive help for debug commands.
* Fix a bug whereby the races represented by numbers could not be selected,
  and the range given didn't match the displayed range.
* Change numerous arrays which had a size determined at run-time because of
  z_info into dynamic ones, or ones which have a constant size.

sCthangband 1.0.1
* Remove the level feelings delay (although the original behaviour exists as
  an option), as it can make the difference between being given a level
  feeling before you clear a level and getting one afterwards.
* Separate the magic device skill from the pseudoid one. The latter is now
  trained by pseudo-identifying items as something other than average, and
  randomly gives strong and weak pseudo-id at skill levels between 20 and 60.
  In addition, pseudo-id frequency increases with every point of skill gained
  rather than every other one.
* Create a "hit" command which does nothing else.
* Make actions which took either 50 or 100 energy take either half as much or
  as much as walking a step so that rods can be somewhat useful later on.
* Increase the energy per turn from 100 to 1000, thereby decreasing the number
  of blows per turn a player with 8 blows per turn has from 8 1/3 to 8.
* Rename mages as wizards, as I've read stories involving wizards...
* Make the quit command messages a bit more in-theme.
* Compare the stat effects of an item with those of the currently equipped
  item in the same slot when examined with 'I'.
* Use the a_info and e_info prices for objects even if they have some random
  abilities.
* Add documentation for commands, options and some prompts.
* Create a window flag to show help on a command, option or prompt.
* Create a z_info.txt file to set the maximum number of objects and monsters,
  the maximum lengths of their names, the maximum sizes of the other arrays
  derived from files in lib/edit and the length of the autoroller delay at
  runtime.
* Reset all keymaps with C:---reset---.
* Only give stat/ability bonuses in the names of objects if there is exactly
  one.
* Only use the randart valuation mechanism for calculating the value of the
  random features of an item which has random flags rather than all of them.
* Saved stats are now used as the defaults for the autoroller.
* Display maximum and current chi total in the character screen, make the
  other displays more compact.
* Use the average discount when piles are combined.
* Make the knowledge screens a bit more colourful, with a picture for each
  entry and a darker colour for dead uniques. As this uses the show_file
  function copied from ToME, it shares the bug whereby a monster represented
  by ] cannot have its true colour.
* Create an auto_more option to cause --more-- prompts to be cleared
  immediately.
* Create a macro_edit option to allow the use of number keys to edit strings
  to be turned on or off with a keypress. If this is on, TAB causes the prompt
  to switch between edit mode and insert mode. If it is off, numbers entered
  via macros are counted as edit commands, and ones entered directly as
  numbers to be inserted.
* Remove bypass_prompt (off), and allow "p\n" to select the default spirit.
* Remove disturb_other (off), as the inscription equivalent is easy to use.
* Remove hp_alert (on), as setting the level to 0% works as well.
* Update z-virt.c and mai*-x11.c to 3.0.0 version. I haven't changed the
  others as I haven't tried to get big screen to work with the main map yet.
* Unset cheat_item at birth.
* Make inscribe_depth apply to every object which is created if set.
* Create a "dimension door" function to handle every attempt to do this.
* Make identify_fully_aux() use a single array containing both the info[] and
  info_a[] fields. Use an empty element to indicate the end of the used array.
* Remove the redundant f? variables from identify_fully_aux().
* Rearrange init?.c to be more like Angband 3.0.0, except that there is only
  one local header which is wiped after each file is parsed, the pointer used
  in most of the parsing functions is passed through init_info_txt() rather
  than being declared static, and the fake arrays (including a fake info array
  provided to allow the size of the info array to be determined as it is
  parsed) remain for most of initialisation.
* The game ignores the last few elements of m_list[], k_info[], etc., in a
  save file rather than refusing to load it. It prints a message as it does so
  so that the player can abort if removing an item was a mistake.
* Remove the redundant object_absorb_2() function.
* Use a function to determine the keymap in use, and one to determine which
  keymap to use rather than looking them up in the code.
* Turn makefile.org into the makefile I normally use.
* Make the overhead map use as much of the current term as is possible.
* Make mystic_armour_aux and ma_heavy_armor() local to calc_bonuses().
* Replace tmpnam() with mkstemp() where available.
* Tidy up the printing of inscriptions on an object a bit, only briefly using
  the format buffer for temporary storage rather than creating several large
  strings which are usually unused. Remove the call to snprintf() from it.
* Make monster_desc() respect MNAME_MAX.
* Rename o_ptr as o1_ptr in object_desc(), in preparation for moving most of
  the attempts to examine the object to an object generated from it by
  object_info_known(). I haven't started to do so yet, however.
* Unsetting flow_by_sound disables flow_by_smell.
* Place option_force[] in tables.c instead of cmd4.c.
* Make ? give help on a selected option (in a hackish way - I intend to make
  this sort of thing work by changing the current window display).
* Move cheat options into option_info to unify the handling functions.
* Remove a few potentially harmful user-initiated buffer overruns.
* Create a rand_range_test() function to decide where a constant was in
  relation to a random range.
* Give an informative message when a pref file loads/doesn't load.
* Put most of load_all_pref_files() in user.prf, and make this safe to do
  before rp_ptr and cp_ptr have been initialised.
* Objects now lose the IDENT_SENSE_POWER flag as they become better
  identified, and *identified* items cannot be called "powerful".
* Make quark_str(0) return "", as this is often a good thing.
* Make item_activation() return an error message rather than a null pointer if
  no activation is found, remove the attempts to use this function as a guide
  to whether an object has an activation as identify_fully_aux() attempts to
  read any null pointer it gets. I don't know how an object got a null
  activation at present.
* Prevent black reavers from disturbing the player simply by moving if
  disturb_move is unset. This was particularly odd as this disturbance doesn't
  occur once the reaver does come into view.
* Respect SF_SKILL_BASE on saving as well as loading.
* Provide a SF_SAVE_MAXSKILL flag to determine whether the total number of
  skills should be saved. Note that the last skill is forgotten if this
  decreases.
* Make the help for show_details accurate.
* Remove HIDE_TYPES from some objects and ego items, and all artefacts.
* Put the inner workings of display_player_skills() in a separate function for
  clarity.
* Create separate functions to calculate the energy taken by mindcraft and
  shamanism.
* Remove the do_cmd_stay() call from do_cmd_invoke().
* Separate the handling of spoil_stat from identify_fully_get(). Make it read
  a few more values from update_stuff() rather than trying to calculate them
  itself.
* Stop spoil_value from giving the real value of an object which has not been
  *identified* yet.
* Fix the "hidden message" problem from being introduced to a spirit.
* Fix a bug whereby the first object in a shop's inventory was not checked for
  stacking with an object the player was trying to sell.
* Change the description of classes of monster to account for the changes in
  what symbol is used for each monster.
* Change Term_save() so that several images can be saved from a term at once.
  This does mean that failing to load a term, or loading it twice, can cause
  problems. The return code from Term_load() is not handled, although the
  program should do something if the window has changed size since it was
  saved.
* Fix a bug whereby identified katanas were still called "Samurai Swords". I
  hadn't realised how simple it was...
* Provide a ^U (^Z with roguelike keyset) function which carries out the
  unified object action whether or not unify_commands is set.
* Change the "Enter shop" key to ^E so that it can have a macro assigned to it
  without disruption.
* Remove the time/date display from do_cmd_version(). As they were based on a
  macro, rebuilding this file every time was becoming annoying, and not
  rebuilding it made it inaccurate.
* Stop window_stuff() from being called in the middle of a macro.

sCthangband 1.0.0
* Use an external program to generate externs.h in such a way as to minimise
  the number of files which need to be recompiled as externs.h changes (using
  ccache as much as possible).
* Cause the level size to be independent of auto_scum. Now dungeons too can
  experience the wonder of 5 minute level generation.

  listing the value as 0 (where appropriate).

  or decreased one number at a time.
* Print the full store inventory regularly to simplify store manipulation.
* Prevent an aborted enchantment attempt in a shop from costing money.
* Prevent shops from destroying items sold to them.
* Track which objects are known to have features not obvious from their

* Any character with hermetic magic skills will get one free spellbook to
  start.
* Pets will not be targetted by the "*" key.
* There are new base skill levels, essentially the level learnable at 0', and 
  these are subtracted from the skill learnable at the current dungeon level;
  for example, it is possible to raise Toughness above 3% at 50'.
* Raising Martial Arts skill now does not depend soley on Close Combat skill.
* Certain changes have been made to allow the roguelike keyset to work better.
* Characters with sufficiently high missile skill get extra shots, depending
  on weapon type.  The most shots are available with a bow, next a sling,
  next a crossbow.
* There is now a visual cue, in the "depth" area, as to whether you are in a 
  dungeon or tower.
* Corrected bug whereby characters with Mindcrafting of 80% or better did not 
  get ESP.
* A character trying to cast a cantrip from a charm unsuccessfully may get no
  effect, rather than destruction of the charm, at very low skill levels.
* Additional documentation has been added.  Most of the differences between 
  Vanilla Angband and Cthangband are now in the "Help" files.
(Thanks to Kieron Dunbar for the following ideas, and, sometimes, code.)
* The display has been changed to show spirits and how annoyed they are.
* *Identified* weapons show what skill they need.
* The restriction on a 6% failure rate to learn magical skills has been
  replaced by a restriction that character skill must be no more than 50%
  greater than the minimum skill for that spell, mindcrafting power, cantrip,
  or spirit favor.
* Minimum annoyance for spirit favors has been raised to 2, so a spirit will
  not immediately become placated for the next turn.

  have less than 75% chance to hit.

  rather than automatically naming it after the character that is

  that they needed to use the 'New Game' command after they had died.

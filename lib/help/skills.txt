#####R=== ToME Skills System ===
One of the big differences between standard "Vanilla" Angband and ToME is the
implementation of a skill system where the player can choose what skills they 
shall improve as their character progresses. As such, many abilities such as
spell casting, fighting and trap disarming *do not* increase automatically - 
the player must choose to use skill points to improve those abilities. This
gives the player the chance to tailor a character to suit their playing style
with a lot more flexibility than has existed with a fixed progression system
in the past. However, not all types of players are able to gain skills to the 
same degree - while a fighter can learn some magic - he's unlikely to become
as good at it as a mage can. So the amount of skill points required to raise
a skill to the next level vary according to the starting "type" of character.

#####GThe Skills Menu
Each time a character gains a level of experience, you receive 4 skill points
to spread around as you wish. To use these skill points, you need to access
the skills menu ("G" for both keysets). This opens up a long list of 
abilities that can be improved. 
The menu may look something like this:

Now, looking at this screen, there are several things to be aware of. The
first line lets you know if you have any available skill points to spend, and
how many there are. Following that are 2 description lines for the currently
selected skill - in this case they are describing the "Combat" skill. When 
looking at the list of skills, there are a few different colours used - the
light green coloured skill (which also has it's starting character in square
brackets []) is the currently selected one - Combat in the example above. 
Skills that you cannot learn are coloured in dark grey. Skills that you are 
capable of learning but as yet have not are coloured in orange, while skills 
that you have some knowledge of are white. 

At the end of each skill is a pair of numbers that represent how well you know
the skill and how much an advance on this knowledge investing one skill point
in this skill would produce. So, in the above example if the player invested 
one skillpoint in their combat skill, the skill would increase from 02.000 to 
02.800.

As well as this, skills are grouped together in similar types. Looking under
the combat skill, there are subtypes of weaponmastery, archery and barehanded-
combat. An increase of one of these subskills will also increase the main 
skill by a small amount. You can tell which skills have subskills by the + (or
-) in front of their name. The + indicates that there are more skills within
this category. To open a skill category up, move the curser up/down until the 
skill category is green, then hit the "Enter" key. Likewise, the - indicates 
that the category is already opened, and selecting this and hitting the "Enter"
key will close it up again. Skills which don't have subskills start with a "."

To spend points on a skill (including skill categories), use the left/right 
arrow (right arrow or "6" adds one skill point, left arrow or "4" removes 
one). Spending points on a sub-skill will also marginally improve the parent
skill (or skill category). When you've finished spending skill points (and any
unspent points *will* be saved), hit the "Esc" key to finish. This will give 
a confirmation prompt to check that you really do want to spend your points as
you've assigned them. Saying 'y' saves the changes and allows you to use or 
apply your new skills :).

#####GThe Skills Themselves
So you want to know what each of the skills do so that you can decide how to 
spend you're hard-earned points, huh? Well, each skill affects different 
abilities, and not all of them are intuitive - but they don't take all that
long to learn :). The skills are:

[[[[[BSpell-power]
This skill is a sub-skill of the Magic skill. It boosts the casting level of

However, handling that much magic is hazardous to your health, and as such 
reduces both your hitpoints and your fighting ability. Any ability in sorcery
affects your Weaponmastery, Archery, Barehand-combat and gives a negative 
percentage modifier to your total hitpoints, equal to the level of your 
sorcery skill (i.e. if sorcery is 12.500, hitpoints get modified by -12.5%).

affects your ability to do magic, affecting *all* the magic and spirituality
sub-skills.
~~~~~51

"soothing the savage beast", the song spells actually depend on your charisma
rather than intelligence or wisdom.

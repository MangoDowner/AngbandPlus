DARK ELF
----------

Dark elves are the dark and evil cousins of the elves.
White haired and with a dark blue skin, these evil
elves have an innate resistance to darkness attacks, but
they have a penality to charisma due to the fact that their
leadership is based on power rather than on diplomacy.
Other than that, dark elves are very similar to elves.

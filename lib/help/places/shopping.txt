===============================================================================

1) First time in the stores 

      Note: In order to buy multiple items in the stores in version 2.8.2, you
      need to precede your command with a 0 (zero), i.e. 025pc - purchase 25 of
      item c. Don't ask me why this was changed.

    Oil & lantern. Not essential, but refilling your lantern is much less
      annoying than re-wielding torches. Also, oil makes a good, cheap missile
      weapon. The torches you start with can usually last long enough until you
      find a lantern in the dungeon. However, if you are the type of player that
      likes to go down levels fast, you won't necessarily find one. Buy one if you
      need to. 

    Shovel/Pick. A necessity of life. Without a shovel, you will have to work
      -much- harder than necessary for cash, because a large porportion of the
      money is embedded in walls, and requires a 'digging implement' to get (the
      only exception is a very strong character can tunnel fairly quickly for
      embedded metals - but for granite you really need an implement). 

      This should be your first purchase. Since you have the repeat command,
      buy a shovel since it is cheaper and lighter. Just go in the dungeon, rest a
      while come back up and check the stores again. 

      Note that non-mages will still want a digging tool once they get down to
      greater-vault depth, since they will have to tunnel around to get at the one
      portion of wall that isn't permanent rock. This is VERY different from
      Moria, where once you got deep enough to find mithril lying around on the
      floor, you could ditch your pick. 

    Phase Door Scrolls - get a good number of these for your first trip or
      two. (At 50' I've run into baby MHD's, Tengu, pseudo-dragons, and many
      other things far too deadly to take on right at the start - an escape route is
      essential - and one Phase Door is not enough. They work best from a
      corridor. 

    Cure Light Wounds potions - restores hit points and cures blindness. If
      you can afford it get a Cure Serious Wounds or two. (After the first few
      levels, you will want to go for at least Cure Serious.) 

    Armor - This depends on your class, and playing style. Long range fighters
      don't need them for a while (especially mages who can phase door away
      from melee). Spend your spare money on cheap items, for now. Helms,
      boots and cloaks are very cheap per point of armour. 

    Weapons - Even the weakest player should consider changing to a
      damaging light weapon like a Trident or Sabre. These are two of the most
      important weapons for characters with high Strength and/or Dexterity as
      well, since they can get multiple attacks with light weapons. Multiple
      attacks make every plus on an enchanted weapon that much more
      powerful, and mutiple attacks with one weapon can do more damage/round
      than single attacks with heavy weapons. 

      If you can only get one hit with the Sabre, you will probably be best off
      with the biggest damage weapon you can wield, unless you are so weak
      that carrying capacity is a major issue (say STR<10). If you only get single
      hits but have reasonable strength (>10 say), a Battle Axe is a good choice,
      or a Two-Handed Sword if you can get/wield it. 

      Any time you have more than one hit, watch out for rings of damage, etc -
      anything that will increase your damage. 

===============================================================================

2) Things you should probably buy whenever you get a chance 

    From the Black Market: Potions of Speed - Handy things to have to kill
      off those speed 2 uniques. Potions of Healing - Good stuff. Potions of
      Experience - easy experience levels (if you can afford them!) 

    Some form of teleportation if you can't cast the spell. (a) Scrolls of
      teleport/Phase Door are cheap, and you can carry multiple scrolls without
      hassle (in case one burns). However, you can't use them if you are blind or
      confused. Potions of Cure Serious cures either situation. (b) Staffs of
      teleport - Carrying multiple staves will eat up a lot of inventory. You run
      the risk of it getting burnt and destroyed. However, you can -always- use
      it, even if confused or blind. Recharge scrolls will extend the life of your
      staff collection (but there is a small risk - only recharge when empty so
      you don't waste charges). 

    It's probably a good idea to stock up on Cure Serious potions, Potions
      of Restore Life Levels, Potions of Restore Mana (if applicable) and any
      Mushrooms of Restoring you find or buy from the Black Market. They
      are good to have when you need them. 

===============================================================================

3) For trips more than 150 feet 

    A bunch of Cure Serious Wounds potions. They cure blindness, cure
      wounds, cure confusion, and are cheap - get a dozen. Cure light wounds are
      cheaper, but don't cure the bigger danger of confusion and are not that much
      cheaper. A quick way to die is to get blinded and then wander randomly,
      and get beat on by multiple monsters at the same time. Or, get confused,
      and then get whaled on by some bad thing. Starving to death while blind is
      no fun (you can't Create Food if you're blind - and sometimes you are blind
      for a long time). These scenarios are easily avoided and should not happen
      if you are careful. 

    A Staff of Perceptions seems expensive compared to identify scrolls, but
      if you sell the empty staff before you buy the next one, an identify from a
      staff is about half (or even less!) of the cost of a scroll. They usually work
      out at about 25 gold per ID from the staff. 

===============================================================================

4) For trips more than 300 feet 

    A scroll of Word of Recall or two. To make your trips up and down into
      the dungeon much saner. You might buy these earlier dependent on how
      patient you are doing down and up. You could use the only for going up
      since down staircases are easier to find. Keep extras in case they get
      destroyed by something. 

    Light Crossbow, and bolts. Enough enchant scrolls to get to (+8,+8). The
      chances of enchanting higher are pretty small, and get smaller the higher
      you enchant. +9 is possible but not likely. +10 almost impossible. A quick
      way of buying large numbers of enchant scrolls is to buy all you can, then
      go down to 50 feet. Rest for a thousand turns to allow the stores to reset
      their inventories. Go back up. etc. This is also a good way to stock up on
      bolts. Missile weapons are often overlooked due to the hassle. But they are
      great. Try them and decide for yourself. 

    It's a very good idea to buy a Staff of Teleportation the first chance you
      get. It can be used anytime at all. Good for getting out of very bad
      situations. 

    One of the handiest items is the Rod/Wand of Teleport Monster. It
      teleports all monsters in a straight line, much like a Spear of Light. Getting
      rid of a monster (or a bunch of them) is much safer than teleporting to a
      random location. 

    See Invisible - You can get this from a variety of sources. You should get
      this before you start encountering invisible creatures that drain (drain stats
      or drain experience). 

===============================================================================

5) For trips below 1000 feet 

    Potions of Restore life levels - You'll need these around 1000 feet and
      below - pesky Ghosts. 

    Resistance things - You will need to get the four standard resistances. In
      order of usefulness: Fire, Lightning, Acid, Cold. Rings, amulets, artifacts all
      grant resistance. You can also sometimes buy armor 'of resistance' which is
      resistant to all four. It costs a lot, but saves ring space, which will be
      quickly filled. You will need to buy poison resistance later, too, or face a
      quick death via breath weapon/stinking cloud. 

    Free Action - You will need free action to prevent instant death by
      paralyzation. If you keep searching the Black Market, you can usually buy
      Boots of Free Action. At higher levels you will be getting See Invisible
      from at least a few items. Free action is usually harder to use, since free
      action is harder to get. This results in having to shuffle other objects around
      whatever is giving free action. (Gnomes are very nice in that free action is
      innate). An Amulet of the Magi is very expensive, but gives free action
      AND see invisible, and also boosts your perception, searching, and armor
      class. 

===============================================================================

6) Other shopping tips 

      Selling unidentified scrolls and potions are a cheap and easy way to
      identify low level potions and scrolls. You should identify staffs and
      wands before selling, since you get more if you know how many charges an
      object has. In the early game, buying identify scrolls and identifying wands
      before selling is very profitable (even if the first few are unsellable).
      If you sell a wand with an unknown number of charges, you'll get offered
      the same money as if it had none. 

      Note that in the UNIX version selling unidentified scrolls and potions is a
      quick and easy way to get barter in the shops. (Any version where you
      leave haggling on.) This also works on the Macintosh. 

      If you want to save on ID's, here's a neat trick for missile weapons: drop
      one of a group, put the rest in your house, pick the single one back up
      again, and sell it. If it was cursed, you can sell the others still. If it was
      enchanted, then it is usually worthwhile to buy it back, because as soon as
      you pick up the rest from your home, they all get ID'd as well. If you want
      to use the rest and don't want to buy the one back, you can inscribe the
      rest to tell you what they are. But it is usually worthwhile to buy the
      single one back, and a lot cheaper than an ID from scroll or staff of
      perceptions. [This is best for characters without a fast pseudo-ID.] 

      If you have an amulet/ ring/ whatever that raises your charisma, it is
      useless to you downstairs. However, on the town level it pays to wear
      one. Keep anything that increases your charisma in your home, unless
      you are desperate for cash - the price difference a good charisma can
      make is huge. Sometimes an amulet of charisma can pay for itself after
      only a few purchases. However, this depends on how close your Charisma
      is to the 'key' points. Increasing a Charisma of 18/01 doesn't do
      anything until you go above 18/50. Then the next marker is 18/70.  So,
      if you have an 18 charisma, don't bother. On the other hand, raising a
      charisma from 17 to 18/10 can make quite a difference. Every point below
      18 is a key point. Likewise, buy potions of charisma from the black
      market whenever possible. 

      A good idea is saving money for buying a great object from various shops.
      These items include Holy Avengers, defenders, weapons of westernesse
      and elven armor that ocasionally show up in the weapon and armor shops.
      Armor of resistance is great to buy from the armor shop, if you have
      money. Some of these weapons are better than almost any artifact the
      player is likely to find down to 1000 ft. However, most of these cost
      around 50,000 gold pieces so start saving up soon. This is a fairly
      consistent way to get Free action / See Invisible. A Crown of the Magi is
      worth almost any price...

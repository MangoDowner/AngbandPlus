#####GDescription
Black-Knights are outcast fighters that survived by accosting travellers
along the roads of Middle-Earth.   They have taken up with evil company
and learned their ways, so they have gained some skill in dark and combat
magics.  However, their studies in magic and practice honing their melee
skills to the maximum has left them with no time to consider ranged weapons,

their internal fortitude from surviving in harsh environments in the face
of fear.

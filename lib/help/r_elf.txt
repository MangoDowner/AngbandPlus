#####R=== Elves ===

#####GDescription
Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at fighting. They 
tend to be smarter and faster than either humans or half-elves and also 
have better wisdom. Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, 
stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons. Elves
may choose any class except Paladin. They resist light effects 
intrinsically.

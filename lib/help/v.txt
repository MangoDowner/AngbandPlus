SKELETON
----------

Skeletons are undead creatures that have been raised from
death by a necromancer. Skeletons make excellent warriors,
as they do not feel pain, they are mindless, and because they
are undeads, they get all the advantages that goes with it.
Skeletons can regenerate themselves extremely quickly, being
able to stand up even after having been completely mutilated,
something even vampires and trolls can't do. However, let's
face it, skeletons are brainless. All they have is an artificial
intelligence given to them by the necromancers, and therefore,
their intelligence is extremely limited. In fact, their
intelligence can only improve trough magical means or trough the
necromancer's powers. Skeletons also suffers great penalities
to wisdom and charisma for obvious reasons, and because they're
only bones after all, they tend to be somewhat frail, innacurate
and weak.

=== List of options and effects (Angband 2.7.9v2) ===


          /*** User-Interface ***/

"rogue_like_commands",    "Rogue-like commands"

    Selects the "roguelike" command set (see "command.txt" for info)

"quick_messages",         "Quick messages"

    Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt.
    Allows any non-"Y" key to mean "no" to the "[y/n]" prompt.  Useful for
    farming lice and worms.

"other_query_flag",       "Prompt for various information"

    Forces the game to ask you before taking various actions, such as using
    things which might cause your pack to overflow.  Forces the game to ask
    you which hand to place rings on.

"carry_query_flag",       "Prompt before picking things up"

    Forces the game to ask you if you want to pick something up when you
    do something that would normally cause the item to be picked up.

"use_old_target",         "Use old target by default"

    Forces all commands which normally ask for a "direction" to use the
    current "target" if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous
    if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

"always_pickup",          "Pick things up by default"

    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up.
    Otherwise, you must use the "g" command, or the "-" command while walking.
    Combined with "carry_query_flag", allows you to selectively pick up all
    items which you step on.

"always_throw",           "Accept all throw commands"

    Tells the game not to force you to verify "throw" commands.  See the
    "command.txt" help file and compare "throw" to "fire" and "destroy".

"always_repeat",          "Repeat obvious commands"

    Tells the game that when you attempt to "open" a door or chest, "bash"
    a door, "tunnel" through walls, or "disarm" traps or chests, that you
    wish to "repeat" the command 99 times or until it succeeds.  See also
    "repeating a command" in the "command.txt" help file.

"plain_descriptions",     "Plain object descriptions"

    Tells the game not to display "extra" information such as the colors of
    potions or the labels on scrolls if you know what the item actually does.

"equippy_chars",          "Display Equippy Characters"

    Display a set of "equipment pictures" representing the twelve slots in
    which you can have equipment.  This is not very useful, and occupies the
    same space as the "monster health bar".

"show_health_bar",        "Display Monster Health Bar"

    Display a "status" bar for the monster most recently attacked or targetted,
    with stars showing the "health", color showing the "status", and an empty
    status bar indicating that the monster is not currently in view.

"show_spell_info",        "Show extra spell info"

    Display "extra" information about spells/prayers when you browse a book
    or ask for a list when studying or casting/praying.

"depth_in_feet",          "Show dungeon level in feet"

    Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level.  This
    also affects the monster memory display.

"notice_seams",           "Notice mineral seams"

    Force the "look" command to describe every "seam" in view.  This option
    is rarely used.  To force "seams" to be displayed like "normal" walls,
    you must use a "user pref file", see "pref.prf" for details.

"compress_savefile",      "Compress savefiles"

    Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages" that
    the player has received.  This can cut the size of the savefile by a
    drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.

"ring_bell",              "Audible bell (on errors, etc)"

    Attempt to make a "bell" noise when various "errors" occur.

"hilite_player",          "Hilite the player with the cursor"

    Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks find on some Unix
    machines, but horrible on most graphics machines.  Note that only some
    machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, hiding
    the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.

"use_color",              "Use color if possible (slow)"

    This option enables the software support for "color".  Since this makes
    the game slower, you should always disable this option if you are using
    a machine which is not capable of using color.

"view_yellow_lite",       "Draw Torch-Lite in yellow (slow)"

    This option causes the grids illuminated by the player's "light" to be
    drawn in yellow.  Turning this option off will improve game speed.

"view_bright_lite",       "Draw Viewable Lite brightly (v.slow)"

    This option causes the grids which are *not* "viewable" by the player
    to be drawn in "dimmer" colors, enabling the player to focus on those
    grids which are actually relevant.  This option also allows the player
    to deduce the existance of certain walls in certain situations, most
    notably when combined with the "optimize_display" option.  Turning this
    option off will *greatly* improve game speed in many situations.


          /*** Disturbance ***/

"find_ignore_stairs",     "Run past stairs"

    Ignore stairs when running.

"find_ignore_doors",      "Run through open doors"

    Ignore open doors when running.

"find_cut",               "Run past known corners"

    Cut sharply around "known" corners when running.  This will result in
    "faster" running, but may cause you to run into a "lurking" monster.

"find_examine",           "Run into potential corners"

    Fully explore "potential corners" in hallways.

"disturb_near",           "Disturb whenever monster moves (nearby)"

    The "distubance" options allow you to determine what should "disturb"
    your character, cancelling running, resting, and repeated commands.
    This option causes you to "notice" motion of nearby monsters.

"disturb_move",           "Disturb whenever monster moves (anywhere)"

    This option causes you to "notice" motion of any monster.

"disturb_enter",          "Disturb whenever monster appears"

    This option causes you to "notice" the "appearance" of any monster.

"disturb_leave",          "Disturb whenever monster disappears"

    This option causes you to "notice" the "disappearance" of any monster.

"disturb_panel",          "Disturb whenever map panel changes"

    This option causes you to be disturbed by the screen "scrolling".

"disturb_other",          "Disturb whenever various things happen"

    This option causes you to be disturbed by various things, including
    monsters bashing down doors.

"flush_command",          "Flush input before normal commands"

    This option forces the game to flush all pending input before every
    command.  This option is silly.

"flush_disturb",          "Flush input whenever disturbed"

    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
    character is "disturbed".  This is useful if you use macros which take
    time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being
    attacked by a monster.

"flush_failure",          "Flush input on various failures"

    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
    "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand,
    etc.  This is very useful if you use macros which include "directional"
    components with commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from
    walking towards monsters when your spells fail.

"fresh_before",           "Flush output before all commands"

    This option forces the game to flush all output before every command.
    This will give you maximal information, but will slow down the game,
    and is not really necessary, since the game always flushes the output
    when waiting for you to press a key.

"fresh_after",            "Flush output after all commands"

    This option forces the game to flush all output after every command.
    This will give you maximal information, but will slow down the game.

"fresh_find",             "Flush output while running (slow)"

    This option forces the game to flush all output while you are running.
    This will give you maximal information, but will slow down the game.

"filch_message",          "Flush messages before every new message"

    This option is silly, but causes each message to be displayed on a
    line by itself.

"filch_disturb",          "Flush messages before every disturbance"

    This option is silly, but allows maximal correspondance between the
    cause of disturbance and any messages related to that disturbance.

"alert_hitpoint",         "Alert user to critical hitpoints"

    Produce a "bell" noise, and flush all pending input, when your hitpoints
    reach the "critical point" chosen elsewhere, preventing stupid deaths.

"alert_failure",          "Alert user to various failures"

    Produce a "bell" noise, and flush all pending input, when various
    "failures" occur, as described above.


          /*** Inventory ***/

"show_inven_weight",      "Show weights in inventory list"

    Display the weights of objects in the "inventory" list.

"show_equip_weight",      "Show weights in equipment list"

    Display the weights of objects in the "equipment" list.

"show_store_weight",      "Show weights in stores"

    Display the weights of objects in the "store" lists.

"show_equip_label",       "Show labels in equipment list"

    Display "labels" (such as "Wielding") in the "equipment" list.

"stack_allow_items",      "Allow weapons and armor to stack"

    Allow identical weapons and armor to be combined into a stack.

"stack_allow_wands",      "Allow wands/staffs/rods to stack"

    Allow identical wands/staffs/rods to be combined into a stack.
    This may force the items to be "unstacked" to use them, which
    may result in "overflow" of the stack.  Also, the entire stack
    can be recharged (and possibly destroyed) at the same time.

"stack_force_notes",      "Over-ride inscriptions when stacking"

    Ignore "inscriptions" when stacking.

"stack_force_costs",      "Over-ride discounts when stacking"

    Force "normal" items to stack with "discounted" items, such that
    all the items acquire the "discount".  Annoying but sometimes useful.

"auto_combine_pack",      "Automatically combine items in the pack"

    Automatically combine similar items in your pack.  Very useful.

"auto_reorder_pack",      "Automatically reorder items in the pack"

    Automatically "sort" the items in your pack.  Very useful.

"no_haggle_flag",         "Disable haggling in stores"

    Disable "haggling" in stores, resulting in a ten percent sales tax
    on items which you would have otherwise been forced to haggle for.

"shuffle_owners",         "Shuffle store owners"

    Allow the store owners to be "bought out" by other store owners.


          /*** Game-Play ***/

"view_perma_grids",       "Map remembers all perma-lit grids"

    Memorize all "perma-lit" grids which you see in the dungeon.
    This allows you to see what illuminated grids you have seen,
    but prevents you from knowing which grids are currently in
    view, unless you are using the "view_bright_lite" option.

"view_torch_grids",       "Map remembers all torch-lit grids"

    Memorize all "torch-lit" grids which you see in the dungeon.
    This allows you to see where you have been, but prevents you
    from knowing which grids are illuminated.

"scum_always",            "Auto-scum for good levels (always)"

    This is a hack but allows you to force the generation of "good" levels
    in the dungeon.  You may have to wait a long time for this on some slow
    machines.  Note that "good" levels usually include "jelly pits" or other
    annoying things, so do not complain.

"scum_sometimes",         "Auto-scum for good levels (sometimes)"

    This is a hack but allows you to force the generation of "good" levels
    in the dungeon.  You may have to wait a long time for this on some slow
    machines.  Note that "good" levels usually include "jelly pits" or other
    annoying things, so do not complain.  This option will terminate after
    testing 100 levels, which may prevent extremely long generation delays.

"dungeon_align",          "Generate dungeons with aligned rooms"

    Force all rooms to be "aligned" with the "panel" divisions.  This results
    in a much "prettier" dungeon, but may result in fewer greater vaults.

"dungeon_stair",          "Generate dungeons with connected stairs"

    Always generate a staircase back to the level you came from, if you used
    a staircase to get to the level.  This is more "realistic", and "safer",
    but less of a "challenge" for some people.

"flow_by_sound",          "Monsters chase current location (v.slow)"

    Allow monsters to make paths to the player when they are nearby.  This
    option is extremely slow, but can produce viciously smart monsters.

"flow_by_smell",          "Monsters chase recent locations (v.slow)"

    As above, but also allow monsters to take advantage of "old" trails
    that you may have left in the dungeon.

"track_follow",           "Monsters follow the player (beta)"

    This option is currently non-functional.

"track_target",           "Monsters target the player (beta)"

    This option is currently non-functional.

"smart_learn",            "Monsters learn from their mistakes"

    Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to,
    and to use this information to choose the best attacks.

"smart_cheat",            "Monsters exploit players weaknesses"

    Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to,
    and to use this information to choose the best attacks.


          /*** Efficiency ***/

"view_reduce_lite",       "Reduce lite-radius when running"

    Make running slightly more efficient, at the cost of knowledge.

"view_reduce_lite_town",  "Reduce lite-radius when running (in town)"

    Make running slightly more efficient, at the cost of knowledge,
    but only if you are in town.

"view_reduce_view",       "Reduce view-radius when running"

    Make running mush more efficient, at the cost of knowledge.

"view_reduce_view_town",  "Reduce view-radius when running (in town)"

    Make running mush more efficient, at the cost of knowledge,
    but only if you are in town.

"optimize_running",       "Optimize various things when running"

    Do not actually display the player when he is "running".  Combined
    with turning the "fresh_running" option off, this results in running
    being so fast as to appear "instantaneous" on some machines.

"optimize_resting",       "Optimize various things when resting"

    This does not actually do anything right now, since resting is
    already extremely optimized.

"optimize_display",       "Optimize various things (visual display)"

    Allow "walls" to be "translucent" to light.  This speeds up a lot of
    the code, but allows the player to notice when there is an illuminated
    room on the other side of a wall, even though he should not know this.

"optimize_various",       "Optimize various things (message recall)"

    Combine identical messages in the "message recall" list to minimize
    the number of screens of messages you have to view.  This can cause
    misleading information since the messages often refer to different
    monsters or objects.


          /*** Special ***/

"use_mirror_recent",      "Recall monster races in mirror window"

    Use the "mirror" window to display "recent monster race" info.

"use_mirror_normal",      "Show equip/inven in mirror window"

    Use the "mirror" window to display the current "equip/inven".

"use_mirror_choose",      "Show item choices in mirror window"

    Use the "mirror" window to display item choices.

"use_mirror_spells",      "Show spell choices in mirror window"

    Use the "mirror" window to display spell choices.

"use_recall_recent",      "Recall monster races in recall window"

    Use the "recall" window to display "recent monster race" info.

"use_choice_normal",      "Show inven/equip in choice window"

    Use the "choice" window to display the current "inven/equip".

"use_choice_choose",      "Show item choices in choice window"

    Use the "choice" window to display item choices.

"use_choice_spells",      "Show spell choices in choice window"

    Use the "choice" window to display spell choices.

"show_choose_prompt",     "Show prompt in choice window"

    Currently unused.

"show_choose_info",       "Show info in choice window"

    Currently unused.

"show_choose_label",      "Show labels in choice window"

    Show "equipment labels" in the "mirror" / "choice" windows.

"show_choose_weight",     "Show weights in choice window"

    Show "weights" in the "mirror" / "choice" windows.

"recall_show_desc",       "Recall monster descriptions"

    Show "monster descriptions" in the "mirror" / "recall" windows,
    and in the "on-screen recall" of monsters.

"recall_show_kill",       "Recall monster kill counts"

    Show "monster kill counts" in the "mirror" / "recall" windows,
    and in the "on-screen recall" of monsters.


          /*** Cheating ***/

"cheat_peek",             "Peek into object creation"

    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

"cheat_hear",             "Peek into monster creation"

    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

"cheat_room",             "Peek into dungeon creation"

    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

"cheat_xtra",             "Peek into something else"

    Cheaters never win.  But they can see debugging messages.

"cheat_know",             "Know complete monster info"

    Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

"cheat_live",             "Allow player to avoid death"

    Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.


          /*** Left Over Information ***/

The "hitpoint_warn" value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints
at which the player is warned that he may die.  It is also used as the cut-off
for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.

The "delay_spd" value, if non-zero, is used to "slow down" the game, which is
useful to allow you to "observe" the temporal effects of bolt, beam, and ball
attacks.

The "preserve" flag, if set when the character was created, cancels all level
feelings of the "special" variety, but allows "missed" artifacts to be "saved"
by wandering monsters and found again at a later time.  This only works for
non-identified artifacts.

The "maximize" flag, if set when the character was created, causes the "race"
and "class" stat bonuses to be applied as "equipment" bonuses.  This usually
makes the character harder at the beginning of the game, but easier later on,
since the stats are no longer limited to a "natural 18/100 value".

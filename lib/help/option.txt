=== XAngband Options and Effects ===

Most of the "options" are accessible through the '=' command, which
provides an interface to the various "sets" of options available to the
player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary
which is shown on the "options" screen, plus the internal name of the
option in brackets, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref
files to force the option to a given setting, see "command.txt" for
more info.

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including
"disturb", (cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which
are in progress), "flush" (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress
queue, including any macros in progress), "fresh" (dump any pending
output to the screen).


***** <Input>
=== Option Set 1 -- Input Options ===

Rogue-like commands    [rogue_like_commands]
    Selects the "roguelike" command set (see "command.txt" for info).
  
Activate quick messages    [quick_messages]
    Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt
    (useful for monster farming). Allows most keys to mean "no" to any
    "[y/n]" prompt.
    
Automatically clear '-more-' prompts    [auto_more]
    The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more-
    prompt, but carries on going.

Enable command selection menu    [command_menu]
    [Return] and [Enter] brings up a menu to allow actions to be 
    selected without having to memorise all the command keys.

Prompt for various information    [other_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask you before taking various actions, such as
    using things which might cause your pack to overflow. Forces the
    game to ask you which hand to place rings on.
    
Pick things up by default    [always_pickup]
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it
    up. Otherwise, you must use the "g" command, or the "-" command
    while walking. Combined with "carry_query_flag", allows you to
    selectively pick up all items which you step on.

Prompt before picking things up    [carry_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask you if you want to pick something up when
    you do something that would normally cause the item to be picked
    up.
    
Use old target by default    [use_old_target]
    Forces all commands which normally ask for a "direction" to use the
    current "target" if there is one. Use of this option can be
    dangerous if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear
    them when done.
    
Repeat obvious commands    [always_repeat]
    Tells the game that when you attempt to "open" a door or chest,
    "bash" a door, "tunnel" through walls, or "disarm" traps or chests,
    that you wish to "repeat" the command 99 times (see "command.txt").

No query to destroy known worthless items   [auto_destroy]
    It can sometimes be annoying that the Destroy command asks for
    confirmation when you are attempting to destroy a Broken sword
    {cursed}. If this option is set, no confirmation will be asked if
    you attempt to destroy an object which you know to be worthless. Of
    course, cursed artifacts cannot be destroyed even if this option is
    set.

Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items   [confirm_wear]
    Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find
    themselves wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this
    option is set, you should be safe from such typing mistakes: you
    will be prompted if you attempt to wear or wield an item if your
    character knows it is cursed.

Prompt before exiting a dungeon level    [confirm_stairs]
    Some players often accidentally press the '<' key and exit a 
    Special feeling level. If this option is set, the program asks for 
    confirmation before you go up or down the stairs. Others may find 
    the prompt annoying, they should of course not set this option. :-)

Automatically open doors   [easy_open]
    Makes it easy for your character to open a door: simply by walking
    into it! Also the open command will automatically select one
    direction if only one door is near you.

Automatically disarm traps   [easy_disarm]
    Makes it easy for your character disarm a trap: simply by walking into
    it! Also the disarm command will automatically select one direction
    if only one known trap is near you.

Display floor stacks in lists   [easy_floor]
    Lets you select an item from a stack on the floor by browsing a
    list, Also floor stack are described as "You see a stack of n
    items.", when there is more than one item on a floor grid.

Allow unified use command   [use_command]
    Unifies the item commands like "zap a rod", "use a staff", "eat
    food", "aim a wand", ... into a general "use object" command. The
    command in the original keymap is "u", and "a" in the roguelike
    mode. The standard commands for eat, quaff, read, zap, aim, ... are
    still available, but can be used for macros.

Allow use of debug/cheat options    [allow_debug_opts]
    Since use of debug command(^A), wizard mode(^W), and Cheating
    options ('C' in options panel) mark the player as "Cheater" who
    can't register their score, these debug/cheat options are
    forbidden to use on default.  The allow_debug_opts option removes
    these restrictions, and allow the player to become "Cheater".

Allow casting spells when short of mana    [over_exert]
    Normally, Hengband restricts you from casting spells when you don't
    have enough mana.  If this option is set, the program allow you to
    cast spells at such dangerous situation.

Use numpad keys as cursor keys in editing mode    [numpad_as_cursorkey]
    Makes editing easier by allowing use of the numberpad keys as if
    they were cursor keys in editing mode.

***** <Output>
=== Option Set 2 -- Output Options ===

Show dungeon level in feet    [depth_in_feet]
    Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level.
    This also affects the monster memory display.

Show labels in object lists    [show_labels]
    Display the "labels" for objects in the "equipment" list, and in
    any "special" window which is displaying the "equipment". These
    labels indicate what the player is "using" the object for, such as
    "wielding" or "wearing" (in a given location). After you have
    played for a while, this information is no longer useful, and can
    be annoying.

Show weights in object lists    [show_weights]
    Display the weights of objects in the "inventory" and "equipment"
    lists, and in "stores", and in any "special" window which is
    displaying any of these lists.

Show choices in certain sub-windows    [show_choices]
    Indicate legal choices in "special" windows which display lists.
    
Use special symbols for the player char [player_symbols]
    If this option has been compiled in, it allows you to display your
    character using race / class / sex dependent colours and graphical
    symbols. Note that the support for this option may not have been
    compiled in on all platforms.

Display 'equippy' chars     [equippy_chars]
    This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn
    equipment on the main screen.  The 'equippy' chars will use the
    standard symbols of the respective items.

Skip mutations in 'C'haracer Display    [skip_mutations]
    Normally, if your character has gained mutations, they will be
    displayed in an extra 'h' mode window under the 'C'haracter
    Description command. Some players may wish to view mutations only
    via the knowledge command ('~' or '|') and do not want any extra
    screens in the Character Description: they should set this option.

Plain object descriptions    [plain_descriptions]
    This option disables "full" names for identified 'flavored' objects, 
    in other words, if this option is not in use, an identified Potion of 
    Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue Potion of Speed. If you 
    prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions, set this option.

Center map while walking (*slow*)    [center_player]
     The map always centers on the player with this option on. With it off, it
     is divided into 25 sections, with coordinates (0,0) to (4,4), and will 
     show one section at a time.

Avoid centering while running   [avoid_center]
     Stops trying to center the map on the player while running (to avoid
     excessively slow "running").

Use special colors for torch-lit grids    [view_yellow_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids
    in certain situations (see the entries for"view_granite_lite" and
    "view_special_lite"). Turning this option off will slightly improve
    game speed.

Use special colors for 'viewable' grids    [view_bright_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable"
    grids in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and
    "view_special_lite"). When this option is set, floor grids which
    are normally drawn in "white" but which are not currently
    "viewable" by the player are instead drawn in "dark gray". This
    makes the "viewable" grids to appear "brighter" than the others,
    allowing the player to easily determine which floor grids are in
    "line of sight". Turning this option off will probably increase the
    speed of the game.

Use special colors for wall grids (slow)    [view_granite_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids
    which are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally
    are). When the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the
    grid is torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the
    "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the "view_bright_lite" option is
    set, and the grid is not in line of sight, or the grid is dark, or
    the grid is only "partially" lit, then we use "gray", otherwise we
    use the normal "white". Turning this option off will probably
    increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for floor grids (slow)    [view_special_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids
    which are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are). When the
    player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is torch-lit,
    we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the "view_yellow_lite"
    option, else if the grid is "dark", we use "dark gray", else if the
    "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line of
    sight, we use "gray", otherwise we use the normal "white". Turning
    this option off will probably increase the speed of the game.

Show a clear contrast between light and dark    [new_ascii_graphics]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all grids other
    than normal white color, when used with view_bright_lite and/or
    view_granite_lite.

Display actual path before shooting    [display_path]
    When this option is set, the targeting mode will show path from
    you to current target point continuously.

Always show list at first when select items    [always_show_list]
    When this option is set, all commands which lets you to choose an
    item from inventory or equipment list will automatically show list
    when activated.

Describe obj's extra resistances by abbreviation  [abbrev_extra]
    When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation
    string for the object's extra resitances and extra abilities are
    added as fake inscriptions of the object.

    A word "EXTRA" means that the ability must not be obvious from the
    objects name.  For example, a pair of boots of Levitation
    sometimes has EXTRA shard resistance.  But fire resistance of an
    armor of Resist Fire is not an EXTRA resistance.

    The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are
    described in (objects.txt#AbbrevList [b])

Describe obj's all resistances by abbreviation  [abbrev_all]
    When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation
    string for all the object's resitances and abilities are added as
    fake inscriptions of the object.

    The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are
    described in (objects.txt#AbbrevList [b])

Show the experience needed for the next level    [exp_need]
    Setting this option alters the display of experience on the left of
    the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next character level,
    instead of the character's current total experience.

***** <GamePlay>
=== Option Set 3 -- Game-Play Options ===

Auto-haggle in stores    [auto_haggle]
    Disable "haggling" in stores, resulting in a ten percent sales tax
    on items which you would have otherwise been forced to haggle for.
    When this option is on, all prices listed in stores will be the
    actual price that you pay for an item, as opposed to the price
    that the shop-keeper will suggest.

Auto-scum for good levels    [auto_scum]
    This is a hack but allows you to force the generation of "good"
    levels in the dungeon. This option may be extremely slow on some
    machines, especially deep in the dungeon. The minimum "goodness" of
    the level is based on the dungeon level, so the deeper you go, the
    better the level will be. A lot of people consider this option to
    be cheating.
    
Allow unusually small dungeon levels    [small_levels]
    This option enables the creation of levels of varying sizes. Levels
    that are as small as the town level (i.e. 1 'screen') are possible,
    yet they can be dangerous, especially for a low level character.
    Note that this option has the side effect of enabling / disabling
    'destroyed' levels (they are enabled if small levels are).

Always create unusually small dungeon levels    [always_small_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than
    usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.

Allow empty 'arena' levels      [empty_levels]
    Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in
    use, levels which have empty floor instead of solid rock may  also 
    be created (somewhat remniscent of Nethack's "big-room" levels). 
    These levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing
    monsters (since there are few obstructions to shield). Arena levels
    may have vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some
    arena levels are dark when they are created, but most are lit.

Merge inscriptions when stacking    [stack_force_notes]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an
    empty inscription and the other does not. The resulting stack keeps
    the non-empty inscription.

Merge discounts when stacking    [stack_force_costs]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have
    different discounts. The resulting stack keeps the largest
    discount. This option may cause you to lose "value", but will give
    you optimal pack usage.

Allow weapons and armor to stack    [stack_allow_items]
    Allow identical weapons and armor to be combined into a stack. This
    also allows unidentified, but identical, ammo to be combined, which
    may result in the auto-identification of some of the ammo, but
    which makes it a lot easier to actually use unidentified ammo.
    
Allow wands/staffs/rods to stack    [stack_allow_wands]
    Allow identical wands/staffs/rods to be combined into a stack. This
    may force the items to be "unstacked" to use them, which may result
    in "overflow" of the stack. Also, the entire stack can be recharged
    (and possibly destroyed) at the same time.
    
Expand the power of the look command    [expand_look]
    Expand the "look" command to allow the user to "look" at grids
    which are not actually in view of the player, allowing the
    examination of objects/monsters which have only been detected by
    spells, or sensed via telepathy.

Expand the power of the list commands    [expand_list]
    Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of
    the appropriate list.  This allows the "look" and "target" commands
    to "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify
    symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

Map remembers all perma-lit grids    [view_perma_grids]
    Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids
    were perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids,
    unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids.  Turning off this option
    allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line
    of sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite"
    option.  Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player
    are always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is
    memorized independantly from the memorization of the grid itself.

Map remembers all torch-lit grids    [view_torch_grids]
    Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids
    have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use
    of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display
    of floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray",
    "lit" grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite"
    option is set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are
    drawn in "orange". Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit"
    are considered to be "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless
    the "view_yellow_lite" option is set, in which case they are drawn
    in "yellow".

Map marked by detect traps    [view_unsafe_grids]
    Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a
    detect trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This
    allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect
    traps, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x'
    are trap free. This option has no effect on surface grids, but
    outdoor locations cannot be trapped.

Generate dungeons with aligned rooms    [dungeon_align]
    Force all rooms to be "aligned" with the "panel" divisions. This
    results in a much "prettier" dungeon, but may result in fewer
    greater vaults.

Generate dungeons with connected stairs    [dungeon_stair]
    Always generate a staircase back to the level you came from, if you
    used a staircase to get to the level. This is more "realistic", and
    "safer", but less of a "challenge" for some people.
    
Get last words when the character dies  [last_words]
    Display a random line from the "death.txt" file when your character 
    dies. If this option is not selected, the "You die." message is
    displayed instead.

Allow shopkeepers and uniques to speak  [speak_unique]
    If this option is in use, shopkeepers may sometimes whisper rumours
    to you. Also certain monsters start boasting as they attack you,
    and, when they die, they say their 'last words'. A speaking monster
    may also (if the option is selected) be wanted by the law, in which
    case you get the reward if you kill it.

Ignore whatever monsters do when out of sight  [ignore_unview]
    Even if you know of actions of monsters outside of your sight through 
    telepathy or other means messages are not displayed.  However monster
    actions will still be recorded in your 'monster memory'.

***** <Disturbance>
=== Option Set 4 -- Disturbance ===

Run past stairs    [find_ignore_stairs]
    Ignore stairs when running.
    
Run through open doors    [find_ignore_doors]
    Ignore open doors when running.
    
Run through trees    [find_ignore_trees]
    Ignore trees when running.
    
Run past known corners    [find_cut]
    Cut sharply around "known" corners when running. This will result
    in "faster" running, but may cause you to run into a "lurking"
    monster.

Run into potential corners    [find_examine]
    Fully explore "potential corners" in hallways.
    
Disturb whenever any monster moves    [disturb_move]
    Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears.
    This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so
    you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near
    such monsters.

Disturb whenever viewable monster moves    [disturb_near]
    Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any
    monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any
    viewable monster becomes no longer viewable. This option ignores
    the existence of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether
    a monster is "viewable". See also the "view_reduce_view" option.

Disturb when visible pets move    [disturb_pets]
    The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not
    apply to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is
    always disturbed by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By
    default, pets do not disturb you even if full monster disturbance
    options are set. If you want your pets to disturb you like normal
    monsters, set this option.

Disturb whenever map panel changes    [disturb_panel]
    This option causes you to be disturbed by the screen "scrolling",
    as it does when you get close to the "edge" of the screen.
    
Disturb whenever player state changes    [disturb_state]
    This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state
    changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

Disturb whenever boring things happen    [disturb_minor]
    This option causes you to be disturbed by various bring things,
    including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and
    beginning to run out of fuel.

Disturb whenever random things happen    [disturb_other]
    In XAngband, uncursed teleporting items may teleport you around
    sometimes, asking for your confirmation (and possibly disturbing
    your rest). If you unset this option, they will stop asking you
    and teleporting you randomly. Cursed items will neither ask for
    confirmation nor stop teleporting you even if this option is
    unset.

Audible bell (on errors, etc)    [ring_bell]
    Attempt to make a "bell" noise when various "errors" occur.
    
Alert user to critical hitpoints    [alert_hitpoint]
    Produce a "bell" noise, and flush all pending input, when your
    hitpoints reach the "critical point" chosen elsewhere, preventing
    stupid deaths.

Alert user to various failures    [alert_failure]
    Produce a "bell" noise, and flush all pending input, when various
    "failures" occur, as described above.

Disturb when leaving trap detected area    [disturb_trap_detect]
    This option causes you to be disturbed when the player is running
    out of trap-detected area.

Alert when leaving trap detected area    [alert_trap_detect]
    This option alerts you with message when the player is moving out
    of the trap-detected area.

***** <Efficiency>
=== Option Set 5 -- Efficiency ===

Use color if possible (slow)    [use_color]
    This option enables the software support for "color". Since this
    makes the game slower, you should always disable this option if you
    are using a machine which is not capable of using color.

Avoid processing special colors    [avoid_other]
    Avoid processing the "multi-hued" or "clear" attributes of
    monsters. This will cause all "multi-hued" monsters to appear
    "violet" and all "clear" monsters to appear "white", and will cause
    "trappers" and "lurkers" to be visible on some machines, but it may
    greatly increase efficiency especially when telepathy is active.
    Certain systems may choose to set this option if they are unable to
    support the special "color" processing, but if they handle graphics
    "correctly", by using attr/char pairs with the "high bits" set,
    then not only will the game correctly avoid using any "dangerous"
    color processing, but it will allow such processing to occur when
    it is not dangerous. So if you are using graphics, and you use a
    "normal" attr/char for the "floor" grids, then you can use the
    "special lighting effects" for floors.

Reduce lite-radius when running    [view_reduce_lite]
    Reduce the "radius" of the player's "lite" to that of a "torch"
    when the player is "running", which makes running more "efficient",
    but is extremely annoying.  Certain older versions of Angband used
    this behavior always, so "purists" should turn it on.
    
Reduce view-radius in town    [view_reduce_view]
    Reduce the "radius" of the player's "view" by half when the player
    is in town.  This makes running faster in town, and also allows the
    player to ignore monsters in town which are more than ten grids
    away, which is usually safe, since none have distance attacks.

Avoid checking for user abort    [avoid_abort]
    Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting
    or running or repeated commands.  This not only makes the game much
    more efficient (on many systems), but also allows the use of
    certain obscure macro sequences, such as turning this option on,
    resting until done, turning this option off, and casting a spell.
    Note that the use of this option may be dangerous on certain
    "graphic" machines. Resting for long periods of time with this
    option set is dangerous since the resting may not stop until the
    user takes damage from starvation.

Flush input on various failures    [flush_failure]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever
    various "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure
    to use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros which
    include "directional" components with commands that can fail, since
    it will prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells
    fail.

Flush input whenever disturbed    [flush_disturb]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever
    the character is "disturbed". This is useful if you use macros
    which take time, since it will prevent you from continuing your
    macro while being attacked by a monster.
    
Flush input before every command    [flush_command]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input before every
    command. This option is silly, unless you are very paranoid.
    
Flush output before every command    [fresh_before]
    This option forces the game to flush all output before every
    command. This will give you maximal information, but may slow down
    the game somewhat. Note that this option is only useful when using
    macros, resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output
    is always flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the
    user.
    
Flush output after every command    [fresh_after]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after not only
    every player command, but also after every round of processing
    monsters and objects, which will give you maximal information, but
    may slow down the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on
    faster machines you normally do not have a chance to see the
    results anyway.
    
Flush output after every message    [fresh_message]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after every message
    displayed by the game.  This will give you maximal information, but
    may slow down the game somewhat.

Compress messages in savefiles    [compress_savefile]
    Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages"
    that the player has received. This can cut the size of the savefile
    by a drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message
    information.

Hilite the player with the cursor    [hilite_player]
    Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some
    Unix machines, but horrible on most graphics machines. Note that
    only some machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those
    machines, hiding the cursor often speeds up the game and looks
    better.
    
***** <Autodestroy>
=== Option Set 6 -- Object Auto-destroy ===

Use easy auto-destroyer    [destroy_items]
    If this option is set, Hengband will automatically destroy all
    objects which you touch unless the object is protected by various
    'leave_...'  options below.

Apply auto-destroy as sense feeling    [destroy_feeling]
    If this option is set, Hengband will apply auto-destroyer on an
    item just when you sensed its feeling.  Typically it will destroy
    {cursed} items just after the sensing.

Apply auto-destroy as identify an item    [destroy_identify]
    If this option is set, Hengband will apply auto-destroyer on an
    item just when you identified it using magical items or spells.
    Typically it will destroy {cursed} items and other useless items
    which you set up to be auto-destroyed.

Auto-destroyer leaves known worthy items    [leave_worth]
    This option protects known objects that can be sold in stores from 
    auto-destruction by the destroy_items option.

Auto-destroyer leaves weapons and armour    [leave_equip]
    This option protects all weapons and armour from auto-destruction
    by the destroy_items option.

Auto-destroyer leaves closed chests    [leave_chest]
    This option protects all chests which are not yet opened from
    auto-destruction by the destroy_items option.

***** <Warning>
=== Option Set 7 -- Warning ===

The hitpoint warning level and mana warning level are set from this 
option screen.

The "hitpoint_warn" value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal
hitpoints at which the player is warned that he may die. It is also
used as the cut-off for using red to display hitpoints.

Ignore quick_message when hitpoint warning    [prompt_hitpoint]
    Allows only [space], [enter], [return] and [ESC] to advance from
    the hitpoint warning message (instead of the 'any key' approach
    used with quick_message set.

Don't skip -more- if you're hurt    [stop_more]
    Doesn't allow -more- to be skipped if you have taken damage.

***** <PlayRecord>
=== Option Set R -- Play Record ===

Dump all abilities of items with their own names   [dump_abilities]
    Dump full information of abilities for all artifacts and named 
    ego items.

Record message log to a character dump     [dump_messages]
    Include message log in character dump.  This will save the last
    40 messages if the compress_savefile option is on, otherwise it
    will save all messages in memory.

Allow notes to be written to a file    [take_notes]
    Allows any player-written notes (with the ":" command) to be written to
    a file and kept (instead of being put in the message list).

Automatically note important events    [auto_notes]
    Used in conjunction with the take_notes option, this option makes a note
    each time you gain a level, kill a unique, find an artifact, etc.
    Which events are included is determined by the following options.

Record artifacts found   [record_artifact]
    Used in conjunction with the auto_notes option, this option makes a note
    each time you find an artifact.

Record random artifacts found    [record_randart]
    Used in conjunction with the auto_notes option, this option makes a note
    each time you find an randomly generated artifact.

Record defeated unique monsters    [record_unique]
    Used in conjunction with the auto_notes option, this option makes a note
    of when you kill a unique monster.

Record completed quests    [record_quest]
    Used in conjunction with the auto_notes option, this option makes a note
    of when you complete a quest.

***** <Autopicker>
=== P -- Auto-picker/destroyer ===

Auto-picker/destroyer editor
    This starts a text editor with contextual help for editing the pref file
    that determines how the auto-picker and auto-destroyer functions work.

***** <BaseDelay>
=== D -- Base Delay ===

The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, is used to "slow down" the game,
which is useful to allow you to "observe" the temporal effects of bolt,
beam, and ball attacks. The actual delay is equal to "delay_factor"
cubed, in milliseconds.

***** <Autosave>
=== A -- Autosave options ===

Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not needed
at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which it, to be
frank, probably is not), the user might forget to and his hardware
could fail him. For all of these reasons, you may want to use these
options:

Autosave when entering new levels    [autosave_l]
        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every time before creating a new dungeon level.
        Useful if you experience hangups in level generation (although
        these should have been eliminated in 2.1.0).

Timed autosave    [autosave_t]
        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency".
        To set frequency press n: it will increase the frequency
        to the next category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories
        being every 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and
        25000 turns. Note that the frequency must be higher than 0
        and the "Timed autosave" set to "yes" for timed autosaves
        to take place.

=== W - Window Flags ===

Selects what kind of information is displayed in which window.
Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which can be used to
display useful information generally available through other means.  The best
thing about these windows is that they are updated automatically (usually) to
reflect the current state of the world.  The "window options" can be used to
specify what should be displayed in each window.  The possible choices should
be pretty obvious.

Display inven/equip
    Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment).

Display equip/inven
    Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory).

Display spell list
    Display a spell list of your magic realm.

Display character
    Display a brief description of the character, including a breakdown
    of the current player "skills" (including attacks/shots per round).

Display messages
    Display the most recently generated "messages".

Display overhead view
    Display an overhead view of the entire dungeon.  This is very slow
    and does not even look very good.

Display monster recall
    Display a description of the most monster which has been most recently
    attacked, targeted, or examined in some way.

Display object recall
    Display a description of the most recently selected object.  Currently
    this only affects spellbooks and prayerbooks.  This window flag may be
    usefully combined with others, such as "monster recall".

Display dungeon view
    Display a copy of dungeon map.

Display snap-shot
    This window flag is currently unused.

Display borg messages
    This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not
    currently supported.

Display borg status
    This window flag is currently used only by the Borg which is not
    currently supported.


***** <Birth>
=== B - Birth Options ===

While cheating makes the game easier, the following options can make
XAngband harder. So if you think the game is too easy, or if you want
to impress your friends, then switch on the following options. The
startup-options can only be accessed while creating a new character
(press '=' while creating the character). There is no way to turn them
off after the creation is finished!

Use 'vanilla' town without quests and wilderness   [vanilla_town]
    Uses the basic town known from the standard Angband and older
    versions of XAngband. This town is only one screen in size and
    contains only the 9 XAngband stores, your home, and the stairs to
    the dungeon. If you use the 'vanilla' town, then there is no
    wilderness, no special buildings and no set quests (but you can
    still use the random quests). This also speeds up the game on
    slower machines, since the wilderness doesn't need to be created.

Use 'lite' town without a wilderness   [lite_town]
    Uses a special town with all stores, your home, all buildings,
    and most quests, but without the wilderness and without other
    towns. This also speeds up the game on slower machines, since the
    wilderness doesn't need to be created. This option will have no
    effect, if the 'vanilla_town' option is active.

Stores are permanently closed   [ironman_shops]
    This option closes all shops. Try to survive in the deeps of
    the dungeon without supplies from town.

Always create unusually small dungeon levels   [ironman_small_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than
    usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.

Don't allow climbing upwards/recalling    [ironman_downward]
    You are not allowed to climb upwards, or recall to town. All stairs
    are downstairs and every time you teleport level, you'll teleport
    to a deeper level. This option may be dangerous in combination with
    the 'small_levels' options, since the creation of quest-monsters
    may fail on very cramped levels, trapping you on the level with no
    stairs up or down.

Permanently enable the autoscummer   [ironman_autoscum]
    This option switches the "autoscummer" permanently on, so that only
    "good" levels are created.  This can mean, that there are good
    items on this level, or that the level is protected by especially
    powerful monsters. In XAngband it often is the later, so use this
    option with care.

Always create empty 'arena' levels (*)    [ironman_empty_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be empty 'arena'
    level. See the "Allow empty 'arena' levels" option above.

Create terrain 'streamers' in the dungeon   [terrain_streams]
    Allows the creation of terrain streamers in the dungeon. This
    allows the creation of 'lakes' and 'rivers' of water, lava and
    trees.

Ask for saving death   [munchkin_death]
    If your character dies and this option is enabled, you will be
    asked if you will be given the opportunity to avoid dying.
    Enabling this option will prevent your character's score from being
    entered into the high-score table and is considered cheating.

Always generate very unusual rooms (*)    [ironman_rooms]
    If this option is enabled, every room becomes a vault.

Nightmare mode(it isn't even remotely fair!)(*)    [ironman_nightmare]
    If this option is enabled, all monsters become unusually
    powerful, and fast. And there will be various unbelievable
    happening in various situations. Furthermore, at 12:00 every
    night, you will have a real nightmare.

Maximize Mode   [maximize_mode]
    The "maximize" flag, if set when the character was created, causes
    the "race" and "class" stat bonuses to be applied as "equipment"
    bonuses. This usually makes the character harder at the beginning
    of the game, but easier later on, since the stats are no longer
    limited to a "natural" value of "18/100".

Preserve Mode    [preserve_mode]
    The "preserve" flag, if set when the character was created, cancels
    all level feelings of the "special" variety, but allows "missed"
    artifacts to be "saved" by wandering monsters and found again at a
    later time. This only works for non-identified artifacts. Anything
    that would have caused a 'special' feeling contributes to the level
    feeling that your character receives instead.

Allow use of autoroller for stats (*)    [autoroller]
    If you choose to use the auto-roller, you can specify minimum
    limit of each stat.  Once you have specified your desired
    statistics, the computer will then randomly roll successive
    start-up characters and compare them to your specified
    criteria. Each stat is rolled as a number from 8 to 17, with a
    normal distribution, and is then immediately modified based upon
    the race and class which you have chosen.  Once a character that
    matches or exceeds your expectations has been rolled, the computer
    will display the character for you to look at, and asks you
    whether you accept or not. You may press Enter to accept. If you
    do not accept, you may press 'r' to resume rolling and searching
    for the next match or, if this is not your first match, 'p' to
    return to the previous character which met your criteria.

Generate character using a point system    [point_based]
    Allows the player to distribute a certain number of points among her stats.
    It results in the player being able to get one or two really high stats, at
    the expense of other not-so-important stats; or to have a well-rounded
    character who is above average (but not great) in all stats. Unused points
    convert into starting gold for the player.

Run auto-roller slowly    [delay_autoroll]
    Makes it easier to see the how the points change.

Prevent some monster abuses   [ironman_hengband]
    Adopted by the Japanese Zangband variant, Hengband.
    Monsters can make effective use of some counter strategies to common
    Angband and Zangband tactics.

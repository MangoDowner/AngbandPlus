FORMULAS GUIDE
----------------

Last Update: Portralis 0.3

This document explains how various things are calculated. This will
help you build a better character out of these formulas. Note
that these are basic formulas, and can be altered by items and
abilities.

MELEE WEAPONS/UNARMED ATTACKS/THROWN WEAPONS DAMAGES

The damages for melee characters uses the following steps:
1. Damages = base weapon damages roll
2. (Base roll) * (Weapon Skill + 1)
3. +to_d% to damages
4. +Strength% to damages

So let's assume the character uses a Long Sword(2d5), with a swords
skill of 50 and a strength of 30. He/she obtains a 10 on the weapon
roll. With a skill of 50, damages becomes (10 * 50+1) = 510. Then,
with Strength giving +5 to_d per points, this character gets
+150 to_d. So that gives the character +150% to damages, so the
500 damages becomes 1275. Then, with a strength of 30, the character
receives an extra 30% damages, raising the damages to 1658. For 
martial arts, the base damages is 1d3, and both the dice number and 
sides increase by 1 for every 15 points in Martial Arts skill. So
with 0 - 15 Martial Arts, the base roll is 1d3. At 15, it becomes
2d4. At 30, it becomes 3d6 and so on.

For throwing, the formula is the same, but the stat is the sum of
your strength and dexterity, as both plays a role in determining
the damages. So if your strength is 20, and your dexterity is 10,
the total stat used is 30. As for hit bonus, the bonus of the item
you throw is used instead of your equipped weapon's.

BOWS/CROSSBOWS/GUNS DAMAGES

The damages are calculated using the following steps:
1. Damages = base ammo damages roll
2. (Base roll) * Launcher's percentile value
3. (Base roll) * (Shooting Skill + 1)
4. +(launcher's to_d + ammo's to_d + ((Dexterity - 5) * 5))% to damages
5. +Dexterity% to damages

ATTACK SPELLS

(Spell's power * (casting stat - 5)) + 10% damages per spellcraft points.

This formula apply to all magic attack abilities as well. So a character
using mana-casting and with 45 Intelligence, casting a spell that does 
20 damages/stat with a spellcraft skill of 0 will do 800 damages. 
With a spellcraft skill of 100, the character will do 8000 damages. 
For standard mana/wisdom-based casting, your character will most likely
choose the Elemental skill, which boost spells by 20% instead of 10%.
In this case, you would do 16000 damages with an Elemental skill of 100!

WISDOM-BASED CASTING SUCCESS RATE

A new feature in Portralis is to allow the use of wisdom to cast
a spell. You can do this using the 'p' command. You will then select
a spell as you normally would. The advantage to this is that the
spell will cost no mana to cast, but the success rate is not always
guaranteed. Here's how the success rate is determined:

Wisdom >= spell's cost

If your wisdom is equal or higher than the spell's cost, you get
automatic success.

Wisdom < spell's cost

A Casting Strength is determined, and will be rolled against the
spell's cost.

Casting Strength = (Wisdom - 5) * 5

Two random numbers will be returned. The first number is a random
number between 1 and the Casting Strength. The second is a number
between 1 and the spell's mana cost. If the first number is higher
or equal, you win the roll, and the spell is cast. Otherwise,
you fail casting the spell.

Spell's cost is more than three times the casting force:

If you try to cast a very costly spell with a low casting strength,
be aware that the spell becomes "risky". If you fail casting a risky
spell, you will take damages equal to the spell's cost, you will
be confused for 5 turns and your wisdom will be lowered by 5 points.

If you plan on using Wisdom-based spellcasting, don't forget that
the Priest has the "Improved Wisdom Casting" ability!

BLOCKING CHANCES

If you equip a shield, or a weapon with a base AC(or two of such items), 
you have a chance to block incoming melee and ranged attacks.
Your initial blocking power is equal to the sum of both items base AC multiplied
by 3. Then, your strength and dexterity are added to this power. You will
then have to win an opposed roll against the monster's strength and
dexterity. If you win, you will block the attack. Note that some monsters
have the ability to block your attacks as well, and the same formula
is used, except that only strength and dexterity are used, no base
blocking chance.

If you play as the Monster race, many monsters have natural countering
abilities. They will use the same formula, but will be a second test
applied after the initial blocking, if your monster can also use
weapons and shields. If that's the case, you'll find that your ability
to block will be much better, especially if you focus in the
counter-improving ability of the Monster race!

REFLECTING ITEMS

Some items gives you the ability to reflect monster spells. In order
to determine if a spell will be reflected, each items you wear gives
you a reflective power of 10/pval. Then, it's a contest between
this power versus the monster's level + mind stat, with two numbers
from 1 to (power) being rolled, and you win the contest if your
number is higher. If you win, the spell is reflected back to the
monster, and it will take the damages of it's spell, while you
won't take any.

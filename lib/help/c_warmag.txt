#####R=== Warrior Mages ===

#####GDescription
A Warrior Mage is a mage that also devotes time to learning to fight. As 
magicians, they are trained in two types of magic, eventually learning 
up to 48 spells in them (although slower than  true magicians); as 
warriors they are far superior to other wizards. The Warrior Mage is a 
truly powerful class, which is recommended for the players who want to 
cast spells but whose mages tend to die too quickly. However, the power 
does not come without a price: Wararrior Mages require more experience 
to advance levels than any other class.

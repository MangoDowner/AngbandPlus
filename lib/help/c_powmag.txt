#####R=== PowerMages ===

#####GDescription
They are combat oriented mages; they don't use any spellbooks and gain 
their spells when they pass a level; they can have up to 100 offensive 
spells which are randomly chosen. But they are very *bad* warriors. 
They also have a lot more of mana than the other spellcasters.

#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (spellcasting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
Power-Mages can wreak an amazing amount of destruction, and they don't 
even need spellbooks to do it. As they gain levels (up to 40), they 
memorize new, randomly generated, attack spells. Note that they possess
no guaranteed utility or alteration magics, and can never alter 
themselves. [[[[[BPower-Mages just kill.]

They use their magics through the 'm' key. They then select a general 
group of spells, followed by a specific spell. Power Mages can learn 
more about a specific spell by browsing it; this is very useful for 
choosing the perfect spell for the occasion.

Power-Magely spells can take the form of a bolt, a beam, a ball (either
centered on the caster or targettable), a meteor shower (multiple balls
in the vicinity of the caster), or an area (effects all monsters in 
line of sight).

#####GStarting Equipment
A power mage begins the game with:
    A potion of detonations
    A scroll of word of recall
    A potion of healing
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:
    a rod tip of light

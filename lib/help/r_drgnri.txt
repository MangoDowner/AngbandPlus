#####R=== Dragonriders ===

#####GDescription
The dragonriders from the planet of Pern are supremely powerful, and, if fed with firestone,  their dragons can breathe flame. They are also telepathic,
and gain the ability to go Between, travelling to any location they have 
previously been. Due to their special clothing, they can resist elemental damage. However, they are none too wise and take a very long time
to gain levels as both human and dragon must accumulate experience.

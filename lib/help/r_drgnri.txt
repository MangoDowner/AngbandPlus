#####R=== Dragonridders ===

#####GDescription
The Dragonridders are refugees from copyright wars.  Despite their names,
they are quite kindly to dragons and ride them around to combat greedy 
copyright holders and their beneficiaries.  Banished by YouBeSoft, they
flew here with their dragons.  The dragons can breathe flame after eating
firescones, the only pastries that promote good dental health *and* blow
things up.  They are also telepathic, and gain the ability to go Betwixt, 
traveling to any location they have previously been. However, they are 
none too wise and take a very long time to gain levels as both human and 
dragon must accumulate experience.

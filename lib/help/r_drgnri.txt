#####R=== Dragonriders ===

#####GDescription
The dragonriders from the planet of Pern are supremely powerful, and their
dragons can breathe flame after eating firestone. They are also telepathic,
and gain the ability to go Between, traveling to any location they have 
previously been. However, they are none too wise and take a very long time
to gain levels as both human and dragon must accumulate experience.

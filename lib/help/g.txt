DEVLINGS
----------

Devlings are descendants of imps and various lesser demons. 
Like the kobolds, these minor demons were often used as slaves 
and minions by more powerful demons. But about 700 years ago, 
a great revolt known as the Devling War erupted in the planes 
of hell, and a battle between the devlings and the greater 
demons raged. Details of the Devling War are rare, as not many 
witnessed it, but it is known that devlings eventually moved out 
of the planes of hell, and came to the prime material plane to 
live in caves, dungeons, and sometimes in civilized kingdoms. 
Devlings are generally red skinned, though there are also green, 
black, purple and orange ones, about three feet tall, and have 
short pointed ears, a tail and strong, powerful legs. Devlings 
are known to fight in large, organized groups, and are known 
rivals to the kobolds. Despite being descendants of demons, they
have adapted rather easily to the city life. They generally fight
with long weapons like spears and polearms.

Though devlings are small and physically weak, they are dextrous 
and are extremely agile and quick due to their powerful legs. In 
fact, their agility is unmatched by any other races. Also, they 
are very skilled with polearm weapons, and have the leadership 
skills required to lead large groups of their kind. Devlings have 
some minor resistance to fire and darkness due to their demonic 
origins. However, the same demonic nature that makes them resistant
to fire and darkness also make them more susceptible to light
than most races.

======================= Bigscreen and Multiple Terminals ======================

********************** Using a Larger Display (Bigscreen) *********************

This version of Ponyband uses's Steven Fuerst's bigscreen code, which
allows you to have a terminal larger than 80x24.  This allows you to
see more of the dungeon map.  It is not necessary to set any particular 
command line or preference options.

Under most systems, you can simply resize the terminal while FAangband
is running, and the game will take advantage of the new size.  In some
cases (eg gcu 'curses' consoles), FAangband will use the terminal size
available when you start the game, but will not resize further.

*************************** Using Multiple Terminals **************************

Terminals other than the main Ponyband window can be used to display
addition information such as character stats and monster memory.  Use
the window flags options (in game, type: "* W") to take advantage of
this.

On most systems, the creation of extra terminals is handled
automatically, or through in-game menus.  In a few cases, options must
be used when starting FAangband:

Using an X display -

Ponyband will open only the main terminal by default.  To use more the
terminals put the option "-- -n#" at the end of the command line when
launching Ponyband, where # is the number of terminals desired, up to
eight (eg "ponyband -mx11 -- -n3").

Using a gcu 'curses' console display -

When the console is large enough, Ponyband will attempt to use space
along the right and bottom of to create three additional terminals.
This uses space which would otherwise be used for the main Ponyband
window.  To disable this feature put the option "-- -x" at the end of
the command line when launching Ponyband (eg "faangband -mgcu -- -x").

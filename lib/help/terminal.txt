======================= Bigscreen and Multiple Terminals ======================

********************** Using a Larger Display (Bigscreen) *********************

Under most systems, you can simply resize the terminal while FAangband
is running, and the game will take advantage of the new size.  In some
cases (eg gcu 'curses' consoles), FAangband will use the terminal size
available when you start the game, but will not resize further.

*************************** Using Multiple Terminals **************************

Terminals other than the main FAangband window can be used to display
addition information such as character stats and monster memory.  Use
the window flags options (in game, type: "* W") to take advantage of
this.

On most systems, the creation of extra terminals is handled
automatically, or through in-game menus.  In a few cases, options must
be used when starting FAangband:

Using an X display -

FAangband will open only the main terminal by default.  To use more the
terminals put the option "-- -n#" at the end of the command line when
launching FAangband, where # is the number of terminals desired, up to
eight (eg "faangband -mx11 -- -n3").

Using a gcu 'curses' console display -

When the console is large enough, FAangband will attempt to use space
along the right and bottom of to create three additional terminals.
This uses space which would otherwise be used for the main FAangband
window.  To disable this feature put the option "-- -x" at the end of
the command line when launching FAangband (eg "faangband -mgcu -- -x").

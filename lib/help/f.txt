KOBOLD
--------

These wild, short, greenish reptilian creatures were thought 
to be weak and ineffective. This was true in the past, often 
used as slaves by other, stronger evil races. However, 1000 
years ago, something unexpected happened, and kobolds united 
together, and rebelled against their masters. These evil races 
were defeated, and many historians associate the dissappearance 
of the orcs and ogres to the kobolds. Kobolds are now 
widespread in the wilderness and filthy areas such as sewers and
the like, as well as caves and dungeons. Having lived in filthy 
areas during most of their history, and having used all kind of 
poisons on their weapons to make up for their small size, Kobolds 
are the vicious masters of poison, and are nearly immune to it. 
Not all kobolds are evil, but they are generally impatient and 
aggressive, especially toward Devlings, which they consider 
rivals.

Kobolds are short, frail and weak, but they are dextrous, agile, 
stealthy and more importantly, the masters of poisoning. They 
use poison spells and attacks better than any other races, and 
are also highly resistant to it. A favorite weapon amongst the
Kobolds is the crossbow, as it allows them to attack from a
distance safely, without exposing their frailer bodies to stronger
races. Kobolds are considered repulsive by most races, although 
they do have the skills to unite together in large, organized groups.

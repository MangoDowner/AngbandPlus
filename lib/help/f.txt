DWARF
-------

Dwarves are short, hot tempered and hardy folks. They are
born in the undergrounds, spending their life in caves and
mines. They are great warriors, proud of their inborn
hardiness. Dwarves tend to shun magic, as they are already
great with their weapons, and consider themselves strong
enough to resist magical attacks with their constitution,
without the need of healing or defensive magic. Finally,
their natural homes have developped their eyes, and are
highly resistant to blindness and have no trouble seeing
in the dark.

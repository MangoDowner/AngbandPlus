====== PosBand FAQ ======


 1. Is PosBand named after Pos Band?
====================================

    No, PosBand has nothing whatsoever to do with Pos Band. *Please* don't
    call PosBand "POS Band". (Also, my nickname is actually made up of my
    initials, Ulyanov Alexander Vladimirovich, and has nothing to do with
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles :-)


 2. What operating systems does PosBand support?
================================================

    I provide the sources, which can be compiled for any supported OS,
    Windows version and Red Hat and Slackware Linux packages. Unfortunately I
    cannot compile PosBand for any other system myself. If you can help,
    please contact me.


 3. What is NPPAngband?
=======================

    NPPAngband is a variant of Angband, on which PosBand is based. NPP
    means "No Pet Peeves"; NPPAngband incorporates many minor changes which
    proved popular among players, but were not included in "Vanilla"
    Angband.

    NPPAngband is actively maintained by Jeff Greene <nppangband@comcast.net>.
    Its home page is "http://home.comcast.net/~nppangband/".


 4. Will PosBand follow the NPPAngband changes?
===============================================

    No. The current version is based on NPPAngband 0.3.4. While Jeff did
    some great work on version 0.4.0, I think that the changes are too
    big to use them in PosBand.  (Some minor enhancements and important
    bugfixes are incorporated, though.)


 5. How do I play the "possessor" character?
============================================

    Just select a "Monster", "Soul" race. You will begin your quest as a
    lost soul, a pretty impotent creature. The first thing you should do is
    to zap a townsman with your Wand of Magic Missile, then seize his body
    (stand on his corpse, then press 'N' and select it). You will need to
    play as a weak warrior for some time -- until you find a better corpse
    to possess. You can press 'N' again to leave your body, but beware --
    it will instantly decay! Do that only if you already have a nice corpse.

    Not all monsters drop their corpses; specifically, Ainur don't. Many
    monsters have undefined corpse information in this version. They won't
    drop any corpses as well.

    Possessing a monster is very similar to playing a real monster race --
    you get all the powers, etc. -- but your body will never grow or evolve.


 6. Can I eat the corpses?
==========================

    Sorry, no :-). This is not NetHack or ADoM. Corpses are generally
    useless for non-possessors, though there are exceptions (e.g. Skeletons
    can heal themselves with bones of the slayed creatures).


 7. Corpses are so annoying!
============================

    You can turn off corpse generation with item squelch menu. Press '=',
    then 'i' to get to the menu, then press 'C' to turn it on or off (This
    is Shift+C).


 8. I have killed Fang, and found some strange collar artifact.
===============================================================

    That's right, many unique monsters have their own artifacts. You will
    always get this artifact if the unique was the king of your race.
    Otherwise, the chance is pretty slim, but you should find two or three
    during the game.


 9. Who are king uniques?
=========================

    King uniques are kings of your race. For example, if you play a Spider,
    then Shelob will be your king. You will get a message whenever you meet
    your king. If you manage to slay him/her/it, you will become a king
    yourself: you will get permanent blessing, heroism and king's artifact.


10. Aren't king rewards a little redundant?
===========================================

    Yes, they are -- so, if you are a Red Dragon, and kill Glaurung, you'll
    get his dragon scale mail with fire immunity, which you already have.
    But remember that these artifacts are not meant for your race only.
    Any character has a 1/15 chance of getting unique's artifact.  So, if a
    human warrior manages to kill Glaurung, and discovers that the armor
    made of his scales doesn't provide any protection from fire, he'll
    be quite surprised.
    

10. How do I use my powers?
===========================

    Press 'U' (Shift+U) to open the menu. Powers are much like the spells,
    but you gain them automagically, and they can depend on any stat, not
    just INT or WIS. (Your power-casting stat will be marked with '*' on
    character screen 'C'. Your mana and failure rates will depend on it.)


11. How can I fight without a weapon slot?
==========================================

    If your body happens to have no weapon slot (that is, you have no arms,
    claws or tentacles capable of holding the weapon), you will fight with
    your innate attacks, displayed on 'C' screen. Your attacks will deal
    fixed base damage, possibly magical, with stat and equipment bonuses,
    if you have them.

    Some very pathetic (Shrieker mushrooms) or very powerful (Quylthulg)
    creatures have no means of physically attacking their enemies at all,
    and have to fight only by careful usage of their powers.


12. How can I use my innate attacks?
====================================

    Some races can use their innate attacks, even if they can fight with
    weapons. Just take off your weapon.


14. The game says I cannot step in the lava!
============================================

    Because you cannot do that! Really, stepping in the lava means certain
    death for any creature (although certain Jedi Knight comes to mind...
    ;-). If you are not immune to fire, the game won't let you step in the
    lava.

    The same applies to the abyss; you need levitation (ex-feather falling)
    to get over it.

    Monsters will also get disadvantages on some kinds of terrain, so you
    can get rid of that Fire elemental by putting it to water (although it
    won't enter it willingly!)


15. Who are the Torturers, the Silver Wyrm etc.?
================================================

    The new monsters, of course. Most (all?) of them were added for some
    reason, not just to have even more monsters. I invented most of them
    myself, some are inspired by Tolkien writings or AD&D. Feel free to
    criticize them or to use them in your own works.


16. Why didn't my new pet follow me to the new level?
=====================================================

    Ordinary pets won't do that. You have to ask it to become your
    companion, via 'y' menu. The number of companions you can have is
    limited and depends on your charisma.


17. Why do I constantly fail to summon anything?
================================================

    The monsters are always summoned from your current dungeon level.
    So, for example, you can summon only the townsmen in the town, and
    you can't summon an ancient dragon before dl40-41, no matter how hard
    you try.


xx. Why do monsters keep fighting each other, and ignore me?
============================================================

    Monsters aren't exactly the best friends of each other.  You don't expect
    Rangers and Paladins to cooperate with Orcs and Nazgul, do you?

    Each kind of monsters has an alignment -- lawful, neutral and chaotic.
    (D&D players: yes, this means approximately the same as in D&D.  ADoM
    players: no, it doesn't have any other gameplay effect).  While neutral
    monsters are not hostile to anyone in particular (except you), lawful and
    chaotic ones will fiercely fight.  Of course, you are still the primary
    target for everyone, and the monsters will likely cease fighting and
    start attacking you as soon as they discover you.

    Note that the uniques are never attacked by monsters, even by your pets
    (except for special circumstances, like playing a Quylthulg or summoning
    the Valar).  They can be hurt by being caught in spell blast/breath, but
    this won't bring them below 0 hit points.


18. What is "a Cloak of Foobar"? Is it a new artifact?
======================================================

    Unless it is associated with some unique, no, it isn't. It is a random
    artifact (randart), generated randomly instead of a real one. It will
    have random abilities, description etc. It won't show in "Artifacts
    Found" list, and it can't be reforged.


19. Why do I found randarts even when I have turned them off?
=============================================================

    The birth option "Randomize some artifacts" affects the standard
    artifacts -- the Phial, Ringil etc. You will find them turned into
    randomized names and abilities, but they'll remain the standard
    artifacts. The real randarts can be generated infinitely, and they
    are available regardless of that birth option.


20. What happens when you reforge an artifact? How can I do that?
=================================================================

    You can reforge any standard artifact (not the randart) in the
    Adventurers Guild. During that process, the artifact essence is
    transferred into another item. You have to provide the original
    artifact, the "target" item, and a large (and I really mean *LARGE*) sum
    of money. The original artifact is destroyed during that process.  The
    "target" item can be any single, wearable, non-artifact item.  (The more
    powerful is that item itself, the less power it will acquire from the
    artifact!). This service is available only when you have sufficiently
    large fame.


xx. How does the invisibility work?  It doesn't seem to affect stealth.
=======================================================================

    Stealth determines how quiet are you -- if you are stealthy, monsters
    won't hear your steps/actions and wake up.  When you are invisible,
    monsters cannot see you, which is rather different.  They won't be able
    to pinpoint your position, and will attack somewhat in random.  Their
    spells and breathes will be very inaccurate, too.

    Not all monsters actually use eyes to see you.  Golems, vortices,
    undeads and some other creatures rely on other senses or magic to detect
    you, and aren't fooled by invisibility.


xx. A monster has mysteriously disappeared!
===========================================

    It stepped into the fog, right?  Monsters in fog are invisible, even if
    you have See Invisible.  The same applies to you.

    Additionally, elementals are invisible (or poorly visible) on their
    native terrain.


xx. I cannot complete the quest (some monsters banished/destructed)
===================================================================

    Go upstairs, and then immediately downstairs.  Your quest will still
    be active, and the remaining monsters will be generated again on the
    new level.


xx. I cannot eat.
=================

    It means that you have to eat in some exotic way.  If you are a magma or
    earth elemental, try eating a wall (you have to stand near it).  If you
    are a basilisk, petrify somebody or something with your power and eat
    its statue.  These ways of feeding are usually more time-consuming.
    

xx. (Anything realism-related)
==============================

    Yes, I am perfectly aware that PosBand is not an accurate representation
    of Tolkien's world.  I am also aware that some of PosBand features (e.g.
    pets breath attacks don't hurting) wouldn't make much sense in the
    real life.  This is the fantasy, role-playing game -- it is not real
    world.  If I have to choose between realism and balance, I will always
    choose balance.  Even a completely unrealistic game may be fun to play
    (do you remember Space Invaders?  Arkanoid?  Air Raid?..).
    

21. You #$@%&!!! My savefiles don't read anymore!
=================================================

    The savefile compatibility is broken in version 0.9.0.  I apologize
    for the inconvenience.  Basically, the whole equipment implementation
    was reworked in this version, and automatic conversion won't work well.
    I tried to preserve the compatibility in all the old versions (despite
    some ugly kludges needed for this), and will try to continue this
    trend.


22. How to make walls use block characters instead of '#' on Unix/Linux?
========================================================================

    For text-mode (gcu) front-end, use "-g" option.

    For GUI (xaw), they are on by default. The characters I've used
    work on my system. If they don't show right at yours, you can try
    to tweak the file lib/pref/feat-x11.prf.


23. Why does the savefile has ".gz" extension?
==============================================

    PosBand 0.9.0 compresses its savefiles using zlib library (savefiles
    compress very well). Compressed savefiles have ".gz" extension.
    They can be uncompressed with gunzip or any other archive tool and
    fed into version of PosBand compiled without zlib.


24. Why I can't read the sources?
=================================

    The source tarball was created on Linux systems. All text files have
    UNIX line-endings (only 0x0a, instead of 0x0d,0x0a). If your text
    editor (or IDE, or whatever) doesn't understand UNIX line-endings --
    well, Get A Real Editor! Vim will do fine :).


25. What are that powers.m4 and powers_*.inc files?
===================================================

    There are about 150 possible monster powers in the current version of
    PosBand. To simplify the maintenance and the adding of new powers, the
    power code is single-sourced.

    powers.m4 is a real source for power code. It is meant to be preprocessed
    with M4 utility. M4 is a very powerful general-purpose macroprocessor,
    available on most of UNIX/Linux systems. (It is little known and little
    used, but it is pre-installed on most of Linux boxes, since it is needed
    for autoconf utility and sendmail configuration.) Five .inc files (meant
    to be #include'd in specific places of .h and .c files) are generated
    from powers.m4.

    Since M4 is unlikely to be found on non-UNIX systems, generated .inc
    files are distributed with the sources. .inc rebuild rule is present
    only in Makefile.std and Makefile which is generated by configure
    script.


26. Why you did remove most of the front-ends in v0.9.0?
========================================================

    Remember what Ken Thompson said?  "One of my most productive days was
    throwing away 1000 lines of code."  And, this time, the code wasn't
    written by me, so throwing away is easy :).

    Seriously, I just don't see the reason to keep them around.

    * "ami" (Amiga), "dos"/"ibm" (DOS), "emx" (OS/2), "vme" (something
      weird). These are ancient platforms, which are used now only
      by true zealots. Well, okay, some people may be forced to use them
      at work, but I don't think they will let you play games on this
      work anyway ;).
    * "gtk" (Unix/GTK+), "xpj" (Unix/X Window pseudo-isometric), "sla"
      (Unix/S-Lang). They look interesting, but I don't really see the
      point in using or maintaining them.
    * "cap" (Unix/termcap). If you need it, let me know. It doesn't seem
      necessary now, since any sane system should have curses.  (Although
      there are lots of insane systems in existence...)
    
    Hacking them back should be easy. Pull the main-xyz.c file out of
    Vanilla, NPP or other *band, set up the autoconf system for it,
    add some lines to main.h/main.c, and here you go.


27. Why did you remove most of the Makefiles in v0.9.0?
=======================================================

    Autoconf ("configure" script) should work with all Unices and Cygwin,
    in all possible configurations. There's no need to keep old Unix
    makefiles. I make the Windows builds myself, with Cygwin, so I don't
    see any reason to keep makefiles for other Windows compilers too.
    If configure doesn't work right on your system, this is probably a bug,
    and you should send a bug report.

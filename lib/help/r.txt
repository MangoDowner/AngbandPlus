ENT
-----

Ents are the giant treefolks, guardians of the forest and
nature. They are tall and strong, but they tend to do everything
very slowly, including thinking. Therefore, they receive serious 
penalities to speed and agility. Furthermore, Ents fear the fire, 
as their wooden body can easily be burned by it. Ents, despite being
rather slow, are very connected to nature, and are able to cast
spells from the school of Nature more easily than other races.
Finally, they digest food slowly, as they can spend long times
without eating.

#####R === ToME Magic - Earth School ===

The earth school of magic contains spells where the raw force of magic is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the 
Impenetrable Earth" which contains all the earth school spells within it's 
bindings.

Worshipping the God Tulkas also gives the ability to cast spells from the 
earth school at a level of 4/5 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill 
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 8 earth school
spells.

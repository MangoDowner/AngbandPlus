=== Proficiencies ===

If you have any proficiency points (Lore, Reserves, or Escapes) you may use your
proficiencies by pressing 'p' and choosing which proficiency you want to use.
You can see your Reserves, Escapes, and Lore points on the left side of the
screen below HPs and SPs. The proficiency points are refreshed each time you go
down a staircase.


=== Reserves and Escapes ===

Reserves accumulate as you gain levels. Escapes accumulate in the same way, but only for the faery races (Elf, Dwarf, Gnome). Non-faeries that are blessed by at least one goddess gain access to some Escapes points at higher levels.

				ESCAPES    ESCAPES
LEVEL	RESERVES	LEVEL   FAERY      BLESSED
10	1		5	1
20	2		15	2          1
30	3		25	3
40	4		35	4          2
50	5		45	5


Both Reserves and Escapes allow you to use one proficiency:

  RECOVER, which uses a point of Reserves, is simply Cure Critical Wounds. You
  can use Recover even when blind or confused.

  ESCAPE, which uses a point of Escapes, is directed teleportation.  Choose a
  direction, and Shift tries hard to teleport you in that direction, usually at
  least 150 feet away if there are enough empty floor squares to land on in that
  direction, and never further than 250 feet. You can use shift while blind or
  confused. You can't choose a direction if you are confused.

The flavour of Escape is that the faery races are able to take shortcuts
through the Faery Realm, which has a strong presence in the Halls of Mist. If
you know where to look, you can find a small portal (a "mouse-hole") and enter
through it to the Faery Realm. Then you shift back to the physical world, in
a different location.


=== Lore ===

INT+WIS		LORE POINTS	AVAILABLE PROFICIENCIES
20+		Lore 1		Alertness, Identify
30+		*Lore* 1	Alertness, Identify Pack, Study Item
40+		*Lore* 2
50+		*Lore* 3
60		*Lore* 4

Lore points and available proficiencies are derived from your Intelligence and
Wisdom. As you can see in the table, INT+WIS 20+ gives you access to Common
Lore, with two proficiencies:

  ALERTNESS grants +15 to saving throw and +30 to finding traps and runes and
  to noticing invisible creatures next to you. The bonuses last until you leave
  the dungeon level.
 
  IDENTIFY.

You gain access to Greater Lore, also known as *Lore*, when your INT+WIS
reaches 30+. At first, you don't get any extra Lore points.

  ALERTNESS. It doesn't get any better at first. However, the effects cumulate
  in case you spend multiple *Lore* points on Alertness.

  IDENTIFY PACK.

  STUDY ITEM. Make a skill check: Alchemy for potions, Perception otherwise. If
  you succeed, you *Identify* the item fully. For potions, that also means
  learning their ingredients and all potions that can be mixed using this
  potion as one of the integrients. Note that Halls of Mist has an artifact
  memory -- information about *Identified* artifacts is kept for future
  generations of player characters.

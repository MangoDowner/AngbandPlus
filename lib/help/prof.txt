=== Proficiencies ===

If you have any proficiency points (Lore, Reserves, or Escapes) you may use your
proficiencies by pressing 'p' and choosing which proficiency you want to use.
You can see your Reserves, Escapes, and Lore points on the left side of the
screen below HPs and SPs. The proficiency points are refreshed each time you go
down a staircase.


=== Reserves and Escapes ===

Reserves and Escapes accumulate as you gain levels:

LEVEL	RESERVES	LEVEL	ESCAPES
10	1		15	1
20	2		25	2
30	3		35	3
40	4		45	4
50	5		55	5
			65	6

Races have bonuses or penalties at the tables:

- All faery races (elf, dwarf, gnome) get +10 levels to Escapes.
- All small races (hit die 8-) get -5 levels to Reserves, and +5 levels to
  Escapes. 
- All tough races (hit die 11+) get +5 levels to Reserves table, and -5 levels
  to Escapes.
- These modifiers are cumulative. For example, Gnomes get +10 levels to Escapes
  for being faeries and +5 for being small. So they get to start the game with
  one point of Escapes.

Both Reserves and Escapes allow you to use one proficiency:

  RECOVER, which uses a point of Reserves, is simply Cure Critical Wounds. You
  can use Recover even when blind or confused.

  SHIFT, which uses a point of Escapes, is directed teleportation.  Choose a
  direction, and Shift tries hard to teleport you in that direction, usually at
  least 150 feet away if there are enough empty floor squares to land on in that
  direction, and never further than 250 feet. You can use shift while blind or
  confused. You can't choose a direction if you are confused.

The flavour for Shift is that the Realms of Angband and the Faery Realm are
very close. If you know where to look, you can find a small portal (a
"mouse-hole") and enter through it to the Faery Realm. Then you shift back to
the Realm of Angband, in a different location. Faery races are obviously best
at shifting, but all characters will eventually learn the secret. Small races
are better at shifting because they can easily slip through the mouse-holes. On
the other hand, they are worse at recovering from damage.


=== Lore ===

INT+WIS		LORE POINTS	AVAILABLE PROFICIENCIES
22+		Lore 1		Identify, Cave Lore
33+		*Lore* 1	Dungeon Lore, Identify Pack, Analyse Item
44+		*Lore* 2
55+		*Lore* 3

Lore points and available proficiencies are derived from your Intelligence and
Wisdom. As you can see in the table, INT+WIS 22+ gives you access to Common
Lore, with two proficiencies:
 
  IDENTIFY.

  CAVE LORE is directed detection for doors, stairs, and minerals.  It also
  grants a bonus to your next mapping attempt.

You gain access to Greater Lore, also known as *Lore*, when your INT+WIS
reaches 33+. At first, you don't get any extra Lore points.

  DUNGEON LORE is directed detection for mapping, minerals, and -- most
  importantly -- traps. It also grants a bonus to your next mapping attempt.

  IDENTIFY PACK.

  ANALYSE ITEM tests a skill: Alchemy for potions, Perception otherwise. If you
  succeed, you identify the item fully. In case of potions, you also learn all
  alchemical information.

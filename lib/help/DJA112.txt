Details on new features for DaJAngband 1.1.2 and differences from vanilla Angband.
==================================================================================

Misc. interface changes
-----------------------

	If blunt weapons are set to squelch "all but spendid" in the quality 
squelch menu, then non-splendid ego-staffs (of types which you have squelched) will 
be squelched also.  Otherwise ego-staffs will never be squelched, even if you have 
that type of staff set to squelch.

Quality squelch is now available for jewelry. The quality choices are:
	1) nonego of squelched type (default) - squelches only non-ego jewelry of 
types you have set to squelch.
	2) all cursed except egos - squelches all non-ego jewelry of types you 
have set to squelch and all non-ego cursed jewelry as soon as you are aware that 
it's cursed.
	3) all cursed (including egos) - squelches all cursed jewelry and any 
non-ego jewelry of types you have set to squelch.
	4) all cursed and all of squelched types - squelches all cursed jewelry 
and all jewelry of types you have set to squelch (regardless of egos).

	You may now look at the contents of your home from the knowledge menu 
accessed by '~' or '|'.

	The character history / note taking feature has been added (from 
NPPAngband).  Use the ':' command to add a note.  On your character dump, it will 
list your history, noting every fifth character level you gain, and whenever you 
kill a unique monster as well as any notes you add.

Some helpful commands 
---------------------

Display monster list ('[')
  This command displays a list of currently visible or detected monsters in a 
one-column display on the main terminal.  It will let you know which monsters are 
in your line of sight and which ones are not aware of you.  It is highly 
recommended to keep this list open in a separate term window. (Type '=' to go to 
the options menu, then 'W' to control subwindow displays.)

Display object list (']')
  This command displays a list of currently visible or detected objects in a 
one-column display on the main terminal.  This list is also available in a separate 
term window.

Command lists ("Enter" key)
  This brings up a little window in the middle of the screen, in which you can 
select what command you would like to use by browsing.  Useful for beginners.

Remove weapon bonuses from a staff ('&')  (added in DaJAngband 1.0.98)
  This removes all weapon bonuses and special abilities of any non-artifact magic 
staff to allow stacking with another staff of the same type.

Add a note to your character history (':'), see above.


More differences from vanilla Angband and 
in-depth explaination of some DaJAngband features:
--------------------------------------------------

	There are now ego lanterns and jewelry.  No ID is required to recognise 
an ego on lanterns or jewelry (as long as you are aware of the jewelry type).

	Magic staves are wieldable and can receive weapon bonuses and egos.

	Traps can now occupy the same space as an object. This will only ever 
happen either by a monster's treasure drops, or by a monster's create traps 
spell (they will never be generated in the same space when you enter the level).  
The map will show the symbol of the object, but if you (l)ook at the space, it 
will tell you that there is a trap there.

	A NPP-style quiver has been added to hold ammo and throwing weapons.  
Each missile (an arrow, bolt, pebble, or shot) takes up one slot in the quiver.  
Throwing weapons take up more than one slot each depending on their weight (a 
throwing dagger takes up 2 slots, a throwing axe takes up 4 slots, and a javelin 
takes up 8 slots).  Each 99 quiver slots takes up one slot in your inventory.

	Missile launchers (slings, bows & crossbows) are slightly nerfed from 
vanilla Angband:  Instead of having a x2 or x3 multiplier, launchers have a 
multiplier level (ML). A sling has a multiplier level of 2 which multiplies damage 
by x1.75 instead of x2, a long bow has an ML of 3 which multiplies damage 
by x2.625, and a heavy crossbow with ML4 multiplies damage by x3.5.

	Weapons which are meant for throwing (throwing dagger, javelin, etc) have 
a damage multipler of x1.4 when thrown at a monster and get the full to-dam bonus 
from strength and full to-hit bonus.  Gauntlets of throwing and occationally 
other items will give your throwing weapons an improved multiplier in which case 
they will have an ML of 2, 3, or even 4, which work the same as bow 
multipliers (ML2 = x1.75).
	Weapons which are good for throwing, but not primarily throwing weapons 
(spear, wooden club, etc) have a damage multiplier of x1.2 when thrown at a 
monster, get partial to-dam bonus from strength, and half of the object's to-hit 
bonus when thrown.  These semi-throwing weapons can only be put in the quiver if 
they are the same weight or lighter than a spear.
	Weapons which are not meant for throwing get 1/3 of the object's to-hit 
bonus and no strength bonus when thrown and a penalty to critical hit odds.

	Double weapons: A few types of weapons, the most common of which are 
quarterstaffs, are double weapons.  Double weapons are much easier to get multiple 
attacks with while not wearing a shield and still slightly easier while wearing a 
shield.  Also, you get +1 to your maximum number of blows while wielding a double 
weapon without a shield.
	Double weapons have two sets of damage dice (you will notice a quarterstaff 
says 1d8/1d5). The 1st and 3rd attacks with the weapon use the 1st set of damage 
dice and the 2nd and 4th attacks with the weapon use the second set of damage dice.  
(This attempts to imitate the double weapons of DND 3.5.)

	Digging without digging tools:  Digging while wielding a sword or staff is 
not as effective as digging while wielding a polearm or axe (unless the sword or 
staff has an acid brand).

	Rubble can be climbed over (or dug up) by both the player and by monsters, 
but it takes some effort (like opening a stuck door).  Small flying monsters can 
fly over the rubble effortlessly (but not bigger flying monsters like dragons, 
they're too big to fly between the rubble and the ceiling).  Also, if there is an 
object hidden in the rubble, you can find it by searching and pick it up without 
digging up the rubble, so there is often no need to dig up rubble.

	Water: You'll now find ponds and puddles occationally.  There is no deep 
water in the game, so it's easy to wade through. There's no risk of drowning in it 
unless you're paralyzed, grabbed by a water monster, or heavily stunned.  Weaker 
fire-based monsters (and some other water-hating monsters) will not pass water 
while stronger fire-based monsters will dry it up.

	Empty Vaults:  In addition to lesser and greater vaults like vanilla has, 
you will sometimes find ruined empty vaults.  Empty vaults do not have out-of-depth 
monsters or treasures and (usually) do not raise the level feeling. They are only 
for flavor.
	There is one (and I may add more later) rare vault design which is in the 
code as an empty vault, but it is more like a large lesser vault (it was too big 
for the size limits on lesser vaults).  It is the size of a greater vault, but 
doesn't have the difficulty or treasure of a greater vault.

	Themed levels:  Occationally you will get another message after the level 
feeling, letting you know that you're on a themed level.  Themed levels are 
primarily populated by certain types of monsters. (A couple examples: a fairy 
forest has fairies and forest animals, a full moon level has more werebeasts, 
thieves, and magic cats, and the haunted castle has knights, gargoyles, and undead.  
There are also themed levels for fire-based, air-based, and earth-based monsters.)  
Certain monsters are never found outside of their themed level.  Because of the 
addition of themed levels, monster pits and nests have been made slightly less 
common.

	Treasure Maps: Any unique monsters which are native to level 35 (1750') or 
deeper have a 6% chance to drop a treasure map.  Reading a treasure map makes it 
much more likely to find vault(s) on the next level you get to by going down stairs.  
This will not help you find a vault when you get to another level by any other way 
than going down stairs.  If a significant amount of time passes between reading the 
map and going down stairs, you may forget the map and it will end up having no 
effect.  This does not guarantee finding a vault, and it has no effect when your 
new depth is less then level 5 (250').  The tourist class gets a spell in a dungeon 
book which creates a treasure map.

	A note about magicbooks: Not all classes which are able to cast spells 
start out with a spellbook, but the class' spell realm is now noted on the birth 
screen when you're chosing you're character. Also, you probably won't be able to 
read every book in your magic realm. When in doubt, try to browse a book before 
buying it: If it shows you the list of spells in the book, then you can use that 
book, otherwise that book is worthless to you. With the chance realm, the tourist's 
books are in the general store. The one chance realm book which is sold in the 
magic store is not useable by tourists, but is of more interest to rogues.
	A note about the Nature and Necromancy realms: These two realms are largely 
borrowed from OAngband, but if you've played OAngband, it's important to remember 
that some of the spells that may have the same name as one in OAngband doesn't 
nessesarily have exactly the save effects. Browse a book and chose a spell to see 
that's spell's description.
	A further note about the Necromancy realm: The necromancy realm has some 
very powerful spells, but that realm also has more drawbacks than other realms. 
(Except maybe the chance realm, but the drawbacks are more obvious in the chance 
realm.) Several necromancy spells have a chance to leave an aura around you which 
aggravates demons.


In-game effects and stats which are not in vanilla:
---------------------------------------------------

	Charm-type effects (confuse, slow, sleep, scare) are at minimum slightly 
more effective than in vanilla Angband, and can be much more effective with high 
charisma.

	Silver & Slime: Infections which have no effect in small amounts, but can 
have nasty effects if you let them accumulate to high levels. Cure wounds potions 
have no effect on them.  The two most effective things to fight these effects are 
elven waybread and the potion or spell of purity. Mushrooms of cure serious wounds 
also has a small anti-silver and slime effect. Mushrooms of health cure a little 
sliming and mushrooms of clear mind cure a little silver poison.  Only a couple 
very rare monsters can cause sliming or silver poison from a distance, normally 
they are caused as melee attacks.
	Sliming slowly turns a person's body into a mindless blob of slime, 
starting by lowering thier constitution. Danger levels for slime: at 20 begins to 
have occational minor effects, at 40 slime starts to have serious effects, and at 
55 slime will be fatal if not cured very quickly. There are more monsters which 
cause sliming than there are that cause silver poison.
	Silver poison makes a person forget who he is and corrupts the mind so that 
he is no longer able to think about anything that matters. Its first effects are 
reduction of wisdom and randomly activated amnesia or hallucenation. Danger levels 
for silver: at 5-14 has rare minor effects, at 15-24 can have very serious effects, 
and at 25 silver poison will be fatal if not cured within a few turns of getting to 
this level.

	Charm: A few monsters can charm you. This timed effect prevents melee, 
shooting, and casting, but only reduces to-hit for throwing. Monsters can only 
charm you in melee, never from a distance.
	Frenzy: A few monsters can put you into a mad, careless frenzy, this has 
several effects: it lowers your to-hit and armor class, just slightly lowers your 
alertness, stealth and saving throw, sometimes makes you hit yourself with your 
weapon, and slightly raises your to-damage bonus. Resistance to charm also 
protects from the frenzy effect.

	Monster curse spell: Some monsters can cast a spell which curses you.  This 
is a timed condition which lowers your armor class, lowers most of your skills, and 
temporarily raises your bad luck.

	Luck: Every character starts with a luck rating which is separated into 
good luck and bad luck (because with some effects, you can have both good luck and 
bad luck at the same time).  Starting luck is always between 17 and 27 (except for 
the rare case of a human tourist who can potentially start with a luck rating of up 
to 30). A luck rating of 20 is neutral; no bonus or penalty. A luck rating above 20 
is good, below 20 is bad.
	Your exact luck rating is hidden. You can get a general indication of your 
luck from the self knowledge screen ('|' or '~' to get to the knowledge menu, then 
'6' to show self knowledge), but the only way to know your exact good luck and bad 
luck is to drink a potion of self knowledge. (BTW, a potion of self-knowledge will 
also now identify everything in your inventory.)
	Luck affects many different things in mostly minor ways. Luck affects 
chance-realm casters, especially the tourist, more than other classes. Beware the 
black cats which can lower your luck.

	Corruption: Your character can become corrupted through use of evil-aligned 
magic items* including Sauron's One Ring.  Corruption can lower your luck, make it 
harder to remove curses, and attract demons.  Not all evil-aligned magic items will 
corrupt you, the item's description will let you know if it corrupts.  Corruption 
can be slowly removed by wielding good-aligned magic item(s) while not wielding any 
evil ones. The only other way to remove corruption is by drinking a potion of 
purity.
	*There is one magic item which can corrupt which is not evil-aligned.  The 
broken sword 'Narsil' is forever tainted by Isildur's decision to keep the One Ring 
for himself instead of having it destroyed.  Because of this, it can cause 
corruption even though it is not evil-aligned.


Here are details on a few of the new monster types:
---------------------------------------------------

	(b) Eirrinel: In appearance like a grey-green bat, the eirrinel is actually 
a type of light fairy. They exist to rescue people from evil places and dispel the 
power of evil magic. Unfortunatly, they consider all non-fairy magic to be evil 
magic.

	(B) Tyerrey: A hawk composed of fire and lightning.  While more common, it 
is lesser-known than the pheonix because when people see it, they think they are 
seeing a pheonix.

	(g) Glarx: The glarx is a two-headed golem created by a mad wizard from 
spare parts of other monsters which he had killed. One head is that of a gorgon, 
naga or harpy and has the power to paralyze. The other head is made of metal and 
can shoot bolts of lightning.

	(h) Hobglibs:  Odd and fervently neutral, hobglibs enjoy playing games and 
expermenting with magic and alchemy. They are humanoid monsters, averaging slightly 
shorter than humans. Their skin is similar in color and texture to that of a potato. 
They typically care about very little besides themselves and they almost never take 
sides in any conflict, though they will sometimes help if offered something 
interesting as a reward.

	(I) Xan: The xan is an agent of the gods of the netherworld in the shape of 
a mosquito.

	(K) Dullahan: The dullahan is the source of the stories of headless 
horsemen.  It is the original headless horseman, sometimes instead driving a coach 
drawn by six black horses.  It carries its disembodied head in its left hand, and a 
human-spine whip in its right hand. It calls to it those who are fated to die.

	(l) Zhelung:  Zhelung lizards are creatures of light distantly related to 
both dragons and light fairies. They live in underground rivers and lakes and they 
love to light up the dark places, but they can be very dangerous.  Well lizards, 
rasti, and zhangs are less magical relatives of the zhelung.  Rasti are like 
reptillian bats, and zhangs are like reptillian wolves.

	(M) Rastlig: From the domain of the grepse, the rastlig looks something like 
a cross between an elephant and a dinosaur. It has wings which are way too small to 
allow it to fly. Despite its comical appearance, it is very dangerous. Its breath 
causes confusion and amnesia.  This is one of the very few monsters which can 
breathe for silver poison. (Amnesia breath from a silver monster will also often 
cause silver poison.)

	(N) Null: The null is a tentacled swamp monster with acid under its skin.  
The nulfraz is a more evil and intelligent type of null which can cast powerful 
spells.

	(u) Scyllis: This minor demon is shaped like a snake with a head on each end 
of its body.  It has no wings, but it can fly and it swings its body back and forth 
to bite with each head. It most commonly appears when summoned to plague and poison 
someone with a curse.

	(w) The Grepse (silver beings): The domain of the grepse is a shadowy realm 
full of illusions designed to make you comfortable and forget everything and 
everyone you used to know.  The most common type of grepse are the vyrms.  Their 
true form is like a flying worm, but they usually wear an illusion making them 
look like a pleasant songbird. Their song creates illusions in people's minds and 
make them forget what they care about.  The silverworm is a weaker form of a vyrm. 
(The domain of the grepse is one of the themed level types).
	Wemu Vyrm: The lord of the grepse, its form is a tiny humanoid made of 
silver slime. It usually wears an illusion making it look like the same size and 
race as its victim.

	(x) Goyley and Groyle: These are lesser types of gargoyles. The groyle is 
sometimes mistaken for a winged orc, though they are usually loners and do not get 
along with orcs. Goyleys are the smallest type of gargoyles are often mistaken for 
winged gremlins.

	(y) Light Fairies: These creatures of light (which means they take extra 
damage from magical darkness) tend to be small and look harmless, but some of them 
are very powerful with fairy magic. The most common light fairies are types of 
sprites and gnomes.  Fairy gnomes (as opposed to the magic gnome player race) are fairies of wisdom and cannot be confused by normal means*.  Bright sprites give 
off light as they fly, which can be bright enough to blind you.
	*Poison has a different effect on light fairies as it does on mortals.  It 
inflicts much less physical damage in light fairies, but it causes confusion for 
them instead.

	The remainder of this document contains information which I would consider 
to be spoiler information.  Read on only if you hate surprises.





Details on the Themed Levels:
-----------------------------

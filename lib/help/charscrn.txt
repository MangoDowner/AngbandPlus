
====== The character screen (in detail) ======

     The character information display allows you to review attributes, change
names, and save character dumps to file.  The save character to file command
saves the character screen, character background, inventory and equipment.

     This interface has three modes, which you may cycle through by typing '+/-'.


--- Main character screen ---

First row:
     - Name : character's full name
     - Gender, race, title
     - Hitpoints : current and maximum
     - Spellpoints : current and maximum
     - Level : goes from 1 to 36
     - Depth in the dungeon: goes from L1 to L50 (50' to 2500')

     - Internal values for each vital statistic, racial modifiers, total 
       modifiers from equipment, and maximum and current values.

Second row:
     - Game turn - note there are 10 game turns in one player turn at normal speed
     - Cur Exp : current experience (is different from maximum only if drained)
     - Max Exp : maximum experience (undrained value)
     - Adv Exp : total experience needed to advance to the next level.  With the 
                 toggle_xp option on, this line displays the total remaining
                 experience needed to gain the next level
     - Gold : money on hand (in gold pieces)
     - Burden : total carried weight (equipment and backpack combined).  Helps
       you learn how much you can carry without being slowed down.  You begin
       to be slowed at 60% of your maximum carrying weight.	
     - % burden : shows the percentage of your max carrying weight.	
     - Armour : your actual base armour, plus what you think your armour bonus
       is (will be accurate if all of your equipment is identified)
     - Fight : plusses to hit chance and damage, before any weapon bonuses
     - Melee : total plusses to hit chance and damage in melee combat, including
       any known weapon bonuses. Converted to a percentage, which is applied to your
       base damage - i.e. 100% here means you do double the base dice of your weapon.
       See the combat section for more on how this works.
     - Shoot : total plusses to hit chance and damage in missile combat,
       including any known weapon bonuses
     - Blows : the number of blows you get with your current melee weapon.
       Shown as a fraction, i.e. 20/10 means two hits per round.
     - Shots : the number of shots you get with your current missile weapon.
       Shown as a fraction, i.e. 15/10 means three shots per two rounds (on average).
     - Speed : your base speed, not counting any temporary effects (temporary 
       hasting or slowing)
     - Infra : how far you can see warm-blooded creatures, even when invisible
       or in darkness

     Secondary abilities would be shown to the right in other *bands, 
     but are not in Ironband.


--- Attributes screen ---

     Press '+/-', and your character screens display attributes of known
(identified) equipped objects.  The '@' lists attributes and modifiers that 
you posses intrinsically.  If you are an Elf, for example, you will always resist light.

Vital Statistics:
     The top-center of this display lists modifiers to stats.  They are light
green if the object does not also sustain that stat and green if it does.  If
the object sustains a stat without affecting it, a green 's' is displayed.  
Because character dumps are not in color, the stat sustains are displayed
in a separated chart from the modifiers.

Attributes:
     The bottom of the screen displays most other non-combat attributes.  Blue
'+' and green '*'s indicate the presence of the attribute.
     - Fire  : plus = resist fire, star = immunity to fire
     - Cold  : plus = resist cold, star = immunity to cold

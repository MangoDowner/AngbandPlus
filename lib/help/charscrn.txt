
====== The character screen (in detail) ======

     The character information display allows you to review your attributes,
change names, and save character dumps to file (which appear in the "lib/user"
directory).  The save character to file command saves several bits of
information including the main character screen, character background, inventory
and equipment, skill levels, and the contents of the home.

     This interface has four modes, which you may cycle through by typing 'h'.


--- Main character screen ---

- Name, title, gender, and race
- Age, height, weight, and either social class (affects starting gold) or your
greatest victory.
- Your base (undrained) vital statistics (stats) and sometimes their drained
values
- Maximum and current hitpoints

- The number of blows you get in hand-to-hand combat, also known as melee
(always starts out as two; may eventually rise or fall)
- Plus to melee Skill (affects how often and how well you hit monsters when
attacking hand-to-hand)
- Percentage bonus to Deadliness:  The melee damage you do is adjusted by this
percentage.
(If you are not wielding a melee weapon, you see a guess at the average damage
you've done recently in karate or wrestling).

- Your character power (affects hitpoints and many other things)
- Score (how well you are doing in the game.  Always starts at zero.)
- Unspent experience (the experience you've earned that you haven't yet spent on
advancing skills)
- Gold
- Maximum depth you've ventured down in the dungeon.

- Maximum and current mana (you need to learn magic to increase these)
- The number of shots you get per turn.  Starts out at zero, increases to 1 if
you wield any missile weapon, and may rise further.
- Plus to missile Skill (affects how often and how well you hit monsters when
shooting)
- Percentage bonus to Deadliness:  The missile damage you do is adjusted by this
percentage.

- Your overall melee Skill.
- Your overall shooting Skill.
- Your overall throwing Skill.
- Your ability to dig through rock
- Your saving throw (protects you from all sorts of nasty magic)
- Your stealth (how naturally quiet you are)
- Your ability to find traps and hidden doors
- Your ability to disarm traps and unlock doors
- Your ability to use magical devices (wands, staffs, rods, etc.)
- How good you are at automatically dodging melee blows and some missiles
- How famous you are
- How far you can see warm-blooded creatures, even when invisible or in darkness

     The descriptions of your basic abilities improve as the abilities
themselves do, but may decrease as you rise in power.  A given disarming skill
is much more impressive at dungeon level 10 than at level 60.


--- History display ---

     This is like the main display, except that the list of abilities is
replaced with a character history.


--- Attributes screen ---

     Lists most of the non-combat attributes that equipment may posses.  Shows
only known or obvious properties.

Vital Statistics:
     In the top-center of this display are listed the internal values (the
permanent ones you have before any modifications) for your stats, any
adjustments through equipment items, any through character race, skills, and
conditions, the adjusted stats, and their drained values (if different).
     Modifiers to stats are light green if the object does not also sustain that
stat and green if it does.  If the object sustains a stat without affecting it,
a green 's' is displayed.

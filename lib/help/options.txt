
====== Options ======

Various concepts mentioned below:
     "disturb"    : cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands
     "flush"      : forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue,
                    including any macros in progress
     "fresh"      : dump any pending output to the screen

Options you may want to change to your preferences include:
     - Roguelike commands, if you are used to the commands used in certain other
       roguelike games, or have no number pad.
     - Checking that the hitpoint warning is non-zero can save your character's
       life.
     - Set the delay factor to two or more, and turn ON "fresh_before", if you
       want to see pretty ball explosions and whatnot.
     - Playing around with the lighting options in the Display Options section
       can be a lot of fun.

Saving options:
     Options are saved in your character's savefile, but you may want to use the
same options for other characters too.  Whenever you save options, you have
essentially four choices of filenames:
     - <<savefile name>>.prf  : affects only that character
     - <<race name>>.prf      : affects all characters of that race
     - <<class name>>.prf     : affects all characters of that class
     - user.prf               : affects all of your characters

     These rules also apply to other kinds of preferences.


--- Option Set #1:  User Interface ---

Rogue-like commands                           [rogue_like_commands]  (off) :
     Selects the "roguelike" command set, which uses eight of the letter keys to
move the character about.  This command set can be really useful if you have no
number pad, and some people just naturally prefer it.  However, the original
command set has considerably more unused keys available for macros and keymaps.

Activate quick messages                       [quick_messages]       (on) :
     Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt.
Allows most keys to mean "no" to any "[y/n]" prompt.  Usage of this option can
be dangerous!

Prompt for floor item selection               [floor_query_flag]     (off) :
     Allows you to choose any item in a floor stack, even if you do not have
"easy_floor" on.

Prompt before picking things up               [carry_query_flag]     (on) :
    Forces the game to ask your permission before allowing you to pick up any
object.  Usually turned on if "auto_pickup" is also ON.  If it is OFF, usage of
this option is normally not necessary.

Use old target by default                     [use_old_target]       (off) :
     Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the current
target if there is one.  Use of this option can be dangerous if you target
locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

Pick things up by default                     [always_pickup]        (on) :
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up.
Picking up objects this way takes no additional energy.  Note the "g" and "-"
commands, which can be used to reverse this option for a single turn, and the
option "carry_query_flag", which lets you decide whether to pick things up.

Repeat obvious commands                       [always_repeat]        (off) :
     The tunneling, altering, resting, disarming, opening, closing, and bashing
commands will repeat 99 times unless you explicitly give a different command
count.

Merge inscriptions when stacking              [stack_force_notes]    (off) :
     Allows objects with and without inscriptions to stack, retaining any
inscription.

Merge discounts when stacking                 [stack_force_costs]    (off) :
     Allows objects with greater and lesser discounts to stack, retaining the
larger discount.

Audible bell (on errors, etc)                 [ring_bell]            (on) :
     Make a bell sound when errors occur (such as typing an invalid key).

Open/Disarm/Close without direction           [easy_open]            (off) :
     When you issue the open, close, or disarm commands, and there is only one
useable door or visible trap adjacent to you, it is selected automatically.

Open/Disarm doors/traps on movement           [easy_alter]           (off) :
     When you move into a door, you attempt to open it.  When you move into a
trap, you attempt to disarm it.

Display floor stacks in a list                [easy_floor]           (off) :
     Displays items on the floor using a list similar to that used for
inventory.  Allows you to comfortably handle large piles of floor items.

Scroll map while targetting                   [scroll_target]        (off) :
     When looking or targeting, the panel will shift as needed, allowing you to
review everything you know about the dungeon.


--- Option Set #2:  Disturbance ---

When running, ignore stairs                   [run_ignore_stairs]    (on) :
     Ignore stairs when running.

When running, ignore doors                    [run_ignore_doors]     (on) :
     Ignore open doors when running.

When running, cut corners                     [run_cut_corners]      (on) :
     Cut sharply around known corners when running.  This will result in faster
running (which matters if you are fleeing), but may cause you to run into a
lurking monster.

When running, use corners                     [run_use_corners]      (on) :
     Fully examine potential corners in corridors.  Activates only in special
cases.

Disturb whenever any monster moves            [disturb_move]         (on) :
     Disturb the player when any visible monster moves, appears, or disappears,
whether in line of sight or out of it.  This increases safety, but may cause
trouble when you have telepathy and are trying to rest.

Disturb whenever viewable monster moves       [disturb_near]         (on) :
     Disturb the player when any viewable (visible and in direct line of sight)
monster moves, whenever any monster becomes viewable, and whenever any viewable
monster becomes no longer viewable.
     It is recommended that you leave this option on; not doing so may cause you
to be ambushed by monsters you can easily see.

Disturb whenever map panel changes            [disturb_panel]        (on) :
     Disturbs you when the map panel shifts.  This slows down your exploration,
but makes it easier to avoid leaving a detected area.

Disturb whenever player state changes         [disturb_state]        (on) :
     This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state changes,
including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

Disturb whenever boring things happen         [disturb_minor]        (on) :
     Disturbs you when you sense wargear automatically (pseudo-ID), hear a door
being bashed open, or begin to run out of fuel.

Verify destruction of objects                 [verify_destroy]       (on) :
     Gives you an "are you sure" message when you try to destroy an object.

Verify use of special commands                [verify_special]       (on) :
     Asks if you are certain before entering wizard, debug, or borg mode (if
allowed).

Allow quantity specification                  [allow_quantity]       (on) :
     Prompt for a quantity when necessary, instead of defaulting to a single
object.  If you prefer to enter command counts before commands instead of typing
quantities when prompted, turn this option off.

Automatically clear '-more-' prompts          [auto_more]            (off) :
     The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more- prompt, but
erases the message instead.  This may speed up play, but can cause you to miss
important warnings or interesting occurrences if you do not have an extra window
devoted to message recall.


--- Option Set #3:  Game-Play ---

Auto-haggle in stores                         [auto_haggle]          (on) :
     Causes you to accept the prices the shopkeeper asks or offers.  Usage of
this option causes you to pay 10% more than normal when buying, and get 10% less
when selling.

Auto-scum for good levels                     [auto_scum]            (off) :
     Regenerates dungeon levels until one is found with enough dangerous
monsters and nifty objects.  Usage of this option makes for more intense but
dangerous games.

Expand the power of the look command          [expand_look]          (on) :
    Expand the look command to allow the user to inspect grids which are not
actually in view of the player, allowing the examination of objects/monsters
which have only been detected by spells, or sensed via telepathy.

Expand the power of the list commands         [expand_list]          (on) :
    Allows the targeting interface to cycle through all appropriate grids, and
your monster recall to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

Map remembers all perma-lit grids             [view_perma_grids]     (on) :
     Memorize all permanently lit floor grids.  Turning this option off allows
you to know which lit floor grids are in line of sight.  If you are using color,
however, the "view_bright_lite" option works better.

Map remembers all torch-lit grids             [view_torch_grids]     (off) :
     Memorize all floor grids that have ever been lit up by the player.  This is
one way to help keep track of which areas you have explored.

Generate dungeons with aligned rooms          [dungeon_align]        (on) :
     Aligns rooms to 11x33 blocks (as opposed to 11x11 ones).  This makes it
less likely that a room will continue past the current panel view, but reduces
the number of large rooms (greater vaults in particular).

Generate dungeons with connected stairs       [dungeon_stair]        (on) :
     When entering a level using a staircase, it remains in place.  This allows
you to beat a hasty retreat if necessary.

Monsters chase current location (v.slow)      [flow_by_sound]        (off) :
     Allows monsters to navigate around obstacles between you and them.  This
option will substantially slow down the game on older machines, but makes
monsters behave much more intelligently.

Monsters chase recent locations (v.slow)      [flow_by_smell]        (off) :
     Allows monsters to track you down by following your footsteps.  The same
comments apply here.

Monsters behave more intelligently            [smart_monsters]       (off) :
     Monsters choose spells depending on tactical situation (for example, they
are more likely to use a healing spell when badly wounded).  They breath less
often (sometimes much less often), but cast spells almost twice as frequently.
They do not cast bolt spells if another monster blocks the way, and can find
hiding places to run away to.

Monsters act smarter in groups (v.slow)       [smart_packs]          (off) :
     Monster packs attempt to ambush the character.  Monster groups are better
at surrounding him.

Monsters learn from their mistakes            [smart_learn]          (off) :
     Allows monsters to learn about your resistances by observation, and to use
this knowledge to avoid making further mistakes.

Monsters exploit players weaknesses           [smart_cheat]          (off) :
     Monsters instantly know all your resistances, and need spend no time
learning.


--- Option Set #4:  Efficiency ---

Reduce lite-radius when running               [view_reduce_lite]     (off) :
     When running, your light radius is reduced to one.  Not recommended for use
unless your machine is very slow.

Hide player symbol when running               [hidden_player]        (off) :
     Saves a small amount of time by not refreshing your symbol when running.
Again, makes little difference except on very slow machines.

Avoid checking for user abort                 [avoid_abort]          (off) :
     Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting or
running or repeated commands.  On some system, this makes the game more
efficient, but on others (including most graphical ones) it can be troublesome.
Resting for long periods of time with this option set is dangerous since the
resting may not stop until the user takes damage from starvation.

Avoid processing special colors               [avoid_other]          (off) :
     Forbids chromatic monsters to shimmer and makes clear monsters appear
white.  May increase speed on some older machines.

Flush input on various failures               [flush_failure]        (on) :
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
failures occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand, etc.
This is very useful if you use macros that include directional components with
commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from walking towards monsters
when your spells fail.

Flush input whenever disturbed                [flush_disturb]        (off) :
     This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
character is disturbed.  This is useful if you use macros that take time, since
it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being attacked by a
monster.

Flush output before every command             [fresh_before]         (on) :
     Refresh the screen before commands, which gives you much more information
but slows down the game slightly.  You must turn this option on to see spell
effects.

Flush output after various things             [fresh_after]          (off) :
     This option forces the game to flush all output not only after every player
command, but also after every round of processing monsters and objects, and
after every message.  This maximizes your information, but may slow down the
game (especially on slower machines) and on faster machines you cannot see the
results anyway.

Compress messages in savefiles                [compress_savefile]    (on) :
     Compress the savefile, saving only the most recent player messages.  This
can cut the size of the savefile substantially, but will result in the loss of
message information.


--- Option Set #5:  Display ---

Show dungeon level in feet                    [depth_in_feet]        (off) :
     Displays dungeon level in feet, as opposed to level.

Show labels in equipment listings             [show_labels]          (on) :
    Display "labels" (what an object is being used for) for objects in all
equipment listings.

Show weights in all object listings           [show_weights]         (on) :
     Display weights (in pounds) of objects in all inventory, equipment, store,
and home listings.

Show choices in inven/equip windows           [show_choices]         (on) :
    Display choices (legal responses) in any sub-windows that are being used to
display your inventory or equipment.  Also, if one sub-window is being used to
display your inventory or equipment, then this option will cause it to be
(temporarily) toggled as needed.

Show details in monster descriptions          [show_details]         (on) :
     Display a description and number of kills for each monster in the monster
recall.

Show flavors in object descriptions           [show_flavors]         (on) :
     Display "flavors" (color or variety) in object descriptions and information
screens, even for objects whose type is known.  This does not affect objects in
stores.

Hilite the player with the cursor             [hilite_player]        (off) :
     Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some UNIX
terminals, but horrible on most graphics machines.

Use special colors for torch lite             [view_yellow_lite]     (off) :
     If the option "view_special_light" is also on, floor grids that are only
lit by the player's own light source will appear yellow.  If the option
"view_granite_light" is on, walls will be colored in the same way.  Turning this
option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for field of view          [view_bright_lite]     (off) :
     If the option "view_special_light" is also on, those floor grids that the
player can see directly appear white, and all other known grids appear dark
gray.  If the option "view_granite_light" is on, walls will be colored in the
same way.  Turning this option off will slightly increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for wall grids             [view_granite_lite]    (off) :
     If either the option "view_yellow_light" or "view_bright_light" is on, wall
grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always being
gray.  This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for walls/veins have
been changed, or if graphics are being used.  Turning it off will slightly
increase the speed of the game.

Use special colors for floor grids            [view_special_lite]    (off) :
     If either the option "view_yellow_light" or "view_bright_light" is on,
floor grids will change color depending on lighting conditions instead of always
being black or white.  This option may not work well if the attr/char codes for
floors have been changed, or if graphics are being used.  Turning it off will
slightly increase the speed of the game.

Center map continuously (very slow)           [center_player]        (off) :
     Center the map continuously.  Advantages include removal of the need to
adjust the map panel and less jerky character movement; disadvantages include
not being able to control your field of view and constant map shifting.
Substantially slows down the game.

Avoid centering while running                 [run_avoid_center]     (off) :
     Don't center the map when running.  A compromise between normal and always
centered movement.

Show stacks using special attr/char           [show_piles]           (off) :
     Displays a stack of floor objects using a special character.


Player color indicates low hit points         [hp_changes_color]     (off) :
	As a player's hitpoints drops, the color of the player changes 
as a warning.  90-100% of max hp - White.  70-89% - yellow.  50-69% -
orange.  30-49% - light red.  Less than 30% of max hp - Red

Verify before descending from quest level     [verify_leave_quest]     (on) :
    Asks for confirmation when you try to leave a quest level using down 
stairs (thereby risking quest failure).

Items marked for squelch appear as dot        [mark_squelch_items]    (off) :
    Any item that is marked for squelching on the dungeon floor or ground 
appears as a purple dot on-screen, allowing the player to easily ignore that
item.

--- Option Set #6:  Birth ---

     You may only change birth options when starting up a new character.

Adult: Allow purchase of stats using points   [adult_point_based]    (off) :
     Allows you to buy stats using a pool of points.  Gives you extra gold for
each point not spent.  This method allows you to raise individual stats higher
than rolling, but does not give you total stats so great.

Adult: Allow specification of minimal stats   [adult_auto_roller]    (off) :
     Allows you to specify minimum stats when creating a character.  Characters
are randomly generated until one is found to meet your requirements.

     If neither of the two above options is set, you roll for stats manually.

Adult: Maximize effect of race/class bonuses  [adult_maximize]       (on) :
     If maximize mode is ON, racial and class adjustments to vital statistics
(stat) act as permanent modifiers.  A Dwarven priest will be able to raise his
inherent wisdom to 18/150, but his intelligence only to 18/40.
     Maximize mode makes races and classes play more differently, usually to the
player's benefit; it is therefore recommended in most cases.

Adult: Preserve artifacts when leaving level  [adult_preserve]       (on) :
     If preserve mode is ON, artifacts will not be lost unless you actually
identify then abandon them.  However, you get no special feelings (which help
you to find artifacts).  If this option is OFF, artifacts appear once and once
only, but you get special feelings.

Adult: Restrict the use of stairs/recall      [adult_ironman]        (off) :
     Can never go up.  Can never use recall until you win the game.  No stairs
are ever placed under you when you change levels.

Ironman Play:
     "Go down into the dungeon.  Return with Morgoth's Crown or not at all."
In Ironman mode, you can never go up any staircase, and can never return to the
surface by any means, until victorious.  If by accident you do, you must
immediately return to the dungeon.
     Some forms of Ironman play require that you visit no stores before going
into the dungeon, or that you must use a down staircase as soon as you see it
("crash-dive ironman"), but they are variants on the basic theme.

Adult: Restrict the use of stores/home        [adult_no_stores]      (off) :
     Cannot use any stores or your home.

Adult: Restrict creation of artifacts         [adult_no_artifacts]   (off) :
     No artifacts will appear.

Adult: Randomize some of the artifacts (beta) [adult_rand_artifacts] (off) :
     Most of the artifacts will get random names and qualities.  This can make
for a fun change of pace.

Adult: Don't stack objects on the floor       [adult_no_stacking]    (off) :
     The game normally allows many objects to stack in each floor grid.
However, some people prefer the challenge of allowing only one object to appear
in each floor grid.  Turning this option ON causes objects dropped by monsters
to disappear if space is tight, and therefore encourages you to fight battles in
wide-open spaces.

Adult:  Have notes to written to a file       [adult_take_notes]     (off) :
	Character can write notes to a specific file.  In addition, notes
are taken automatically when: a player reaches a character level
divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, etc..), a unique is killed, an artifact is
identified, or a greater vault created.  The turn, character level, and 
depth of the player is automatically recorded.  This information is 
in character dumps near the bottom.  For certain artifacts of unusual power
artifacts found out of depth, or unusually rare artifacts, the level the 
artifact was found is recorded, rather than the level the player
is on when they identify the item.  Also given separate notes are 
player birth, death, and the killing of Morgoth.  

Adult:  All Levels Will Be Generates As Small [birth_force_small_lev] (off) :
    All levels will be generated as small levels, giving you less space to 
    which you can run...

Adult: 	Retain squelch settings		      [birth_retain_squelch]  (off) :
    If this option is set, the new character will keep the squelch settings of
    his immediate ancestor. If it is not set, the character's squelch settings
    will revert to the defaults.

--- Option Set #7:  Cheat ---

Peek into object creation                     [cheat_peek]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

Peek into monster creation                    [cheat_hear]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

Peek into dungeon creation                    [cheat_room]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

Know complete monster info                    [cheat_know]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

Allow player to avoid death                   [cheat_live]           (off) :
     Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.


--- Window Options ---

Window Flags:
     Some platforms support multiple windows, which can display all sorts of
useful information.  The best thing about these windows is that they are
(usually) updated automatically to reflect the current state of the world.

     inven/equip:       Display the player inventory (and equipment).
     equip/inven:       Display the player equipment (and inventory).
     player (basic):    Display the main character screen.
     player (extra):    Display the character screen's equipment flags section.
     messages:          Display recent messages and notes.
     overhead view:     Display an overhead view of the dungeon.
     monster recall:    Display a description of the target monster.

--- Miscellaneous Options ---

Hitpoint warning:
     If non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints (x10) at which you
start to get special warnings.  It is also used as the cut-off for using red to
display both hitpoints and mana.

Delay Factor:
     The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects
used for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal
to "delay_factor" squared, in milliseconds.  A value of five works well on many
machines.
     Note:  You also need to have "fresh_before" ON.


--- Options Commands ---

Load a user pref file:
     Reads user preferences (including options) from a file you choose.
Normally used when preferences don't load automatically, and you want to rewrite
them to a file that will.

Append options to a file:
     Saves options to file.  See the preferences section for help on what
filename to use (the file "user.prf" usually works).

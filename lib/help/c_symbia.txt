#####R=== Symbiants ===

#####GDescription
Symbiants live in harmony with all of the monsters that do not move; 
the Mushrooms, Molds, Floating Eyes, and such. They can hypnotize these
creatures and then wield them like items. Using certain spells in their
unique magical realm, they can even use the magical powers of their pets
like magic books.

#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (spell casting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
Symbiants rely on the partnerships they form, hypnotizing creatures
and then "wearing" them: "I get by with a little help from my friends.".
Depending on the monster, this does nothing except protect the player 
slightly (the worn monster takes some of the damage the player would 
otherwise) or grant some very powerful attacks and summons.  Symbiants 
only have two spellbooks (in the *****m_symbio.txt*0[Symbiotic] realm), one found deep in 
the dungeon, but have more than enough spells to keep their symbiotic 
relationships strong.

They cast spells normally, and can hypnotize adjacent creatures that 
cannot move by using the 'U' command ('O' for roguelike commands). The 
monster becomes an object, and can be worn. Symbiants, unlike any other
class, don't have to worry about being attacked by the monster they are
wearing.

    L1 spellbook of symbiotic magic

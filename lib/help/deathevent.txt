Instructions for describing death events

To cause a specific action to happen on death, there needs to be a line
beginning with 'E:'. On the same line, there must be one of the flags listed
below, usually together with a number of symbols as described.

The flags are as follows:

Flag      ARTEFACT
Keywords: n<num>*
Effect:   Creates artefact number <num> (see a_info.txt for list).
Default:  Does nothing.

Flag      OBJECT
Keywords: t<tval>* s<sval>* e<ego type>* (<min no.>-<max no.>)
Effect:   Creates between <min no.> and <max no.> objects (see k_info.txt for
          tval and sval numbers and e_info.txt for ego types).
          The game does not check that the given combination is reasonable.
Default:  Creates 1 object which is not an ego item.
          The <tval> and <sval> (or their textual replacement) must point to a
          real object.

Flag      NONSTER
Keywords: n<number>* s<distance> (<min no.>-<max-no.>)
Effect:   Creates between <min no.> and <max no.> monsters of type <number>
          (see r_info.txt for list), at a distance of around <distance>
          from the original monster.
Default:  Creates 1 monster, preferably within one square of the original.
          The <number> must point to a monster.

Flag      EXPLODE
Keywords: r<radius> (<dice>d<sides>) <effect>
Effect:   Causes an explosion of radius <radius> causing <dice>d<sides> damage
          to the monsters in its path.
Default:  Causes an explosion of MISSILE type which does 1 point of damage to
          everything 1 square away from the monster.

<effect> can be any one of the following (not all of which are sensible):
"ELEC",  "POIS", "ACID", "COLD", "FIRE", "MISSILE", "ARROW", "PLASMA", "WATER",
"LITE", "DARK", "LITE_WEAK", "DARK_WEAK", "SHARDS", "SOUND", "CONFUSION",
"FORCE", "INERTIA", "MANA", "METEOR", "ICE", "CHAOS", "NETHER", "DISENCHANT",
"NEXUS", "TIME", "GRAVITY", "KILL_WALL", "KILL_DOOR", "KILL_TRAP", "MAKE_WALL",
"MAKE_DOOR", "MAKE_TRAP", "OLD_CLONE", "OLD_POLY", "OLD_HEAL", "OLD_SPEED",
"OLD_SLOW", "OLD_CONF", "OLD_SLEEP", "OLD_DRAIN", "AWAY_UNDEAD", "AWAY_EVIL",
"AWAY_ALL", "TURN_UNDEAD", "TURN_EVIL", "TURN_ALL", "DISP_UNDEAD", "DISP_EVIL",
"DISP_ALL", "DISP_DEMON", "DISP_LIVING", "SHARD", "NUKE", "MAKE_GLYPH",
"STASIS", "STONE_WALL", "DEATH_RAY", "STUN", "HOLY_FIRE", "HELL_FIRE",
"DISINTEGRATE", "CHARM", "CONTROL_UNDEAD", "CONTROL_ANIMAL", "PSI",
"PSI_DRAIN", "TELEKINESIS", "JAM_DOOR", "DOMINATION", "DISP_GOOD"

Flag:     COIN
Keywords: <type>
Effect:   Causes the coins which the given monster drops to be of a specific
          type. This replaces the previous creeping coin code, but can be
          applied to anything. Unlike other types, this does not drop anything
          itself, but only changes how gold drops are interpreted.

<type> can be any of: "COPPER", "SILVER", "GOLD", "MITHRIL", or "ADAMANTIUM".

Flag:     NOTHING
Keywords: none
Effects:  This is has no effects in itself, but can be used to enable a monster
          to use the "text" flag below without needing to do anything else.

There may also be a number of flags which are valid for all events. They are:

Keyword:  p<num>/<denom>.
Effect:   Causes the event to have a <num> in <denom> chance of happening
         when the monster dies.
Default:  p1/1

Keyword:  "<text>"
Effect:   Causes <text> to be printed on the screen when this event happens.
         This is slightly modified for the DEATH_MONSTER type in that it only
         happens when the player sees the new monster appear.
Default:  no text

Flag:     ONLY_ONE
Effect:   Only one of the events with this flag will be generated when a monster
          dies. The probability of each happening will, however, be as stated.

Note that symbols which require numbers as arguments require them to be
immediately after the number as this is what the parser expects.

The keywords marked with * can be replaced by an appropriate text string from
an info file. This must be the name as given in the N: line of the relevant
file, strange formatting and all.

Also note that putting an argument which is not associated with the given flag
will not result in an error, but simply not be parsed.

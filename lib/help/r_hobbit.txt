#####R=== Hobbits ===

#####GDescription
Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have good 
saving throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming, perception,
and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to be called 
burglars. They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting.
Halflings have fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm creatures at a 
distance. Hobbits have their dexterity sustained and in time they learn to cook a 
delicious meal from available ingredients.  They're sturdy constitutions also allow them to resist the insidious poison of the ring-wraiths

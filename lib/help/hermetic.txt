Hermetic Magic
==============

Hermetic magic is the most powerful of the types of magic available in Cthangband. It is also the most difficult to learn and use. A high intelligence is essential for a hermetic wizard. Hermetic magic comes from spells written in books. Casting these spells uses 'Mana' which you channel using your 'Mana Channeling' skill. The more skill you have, the more mana you will be able to channel.

Requirements
============

Hermetic spells are difficult to learn and must be studied in peaceful surroundings. Bookstores set aside an area for study, and new hermetic spells can be learned there. Only a limited number of spells can be learned, although this number increases as your 'mana channeling' skill increases. To cast a spell, you must have your spellbook with you and be able to read it - so hermetic spells can't be cast in the dark or whilst blind. You must also have a clear head, so confusion will also prevent you from casting spells.

Wearing large amounts of armour will interfere with your mana channeling skill - causing the amount of mana available to you to be reduced, and wearing any kind of hand covering other than gauntlets of agility or free action will hinder your hand movements also making it harder to cast hermetic spells.

Usage
=====

You can use hermetic spells at any time except when in a shop. Press the 'm' key to cast a spell, and then select which book to cast from and which spell you wish to cast from the book. Your ability to cast hermetic spells is rather limited by your circumstances so make sure that you fulfill all the requirements.

Abilities
=========

Hermetic magic is split into four schools, each of which has four books full of spells. These schools are Necromancy, Thaumaturgy, Conjuration and Sorcery. Within each school, individual spells have one of four types - Naturae spells deal with matter, Animae spells deal with spirits, Corporis spells deal with flesh and Vis spells deal with raw power and energy. The spells of each school and book are listed below, as well as the skill needed to cast each one and its mana cost. The skill used for each spell is the average of your skills for the school and the type of the spell - for example, to cast 'Phase Door' from the sorcery book 'Beginners Handbook' you need an average of 'Sorcery' and 'Corporis' skills of 2%.

=== Races ===

There are thirteen different races that you can choose from in EyAngband.
Some races are restricted as to what profession they may be, and each race 
has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities.  The race stat
adjustment lasts throughout the game, raising the maximum levels the character
can otherwise acheive in this stat. Most races also have intrinsic abilities.
 
***** <Human>
Human
    The oldest race in the world of EyAngband, the human is the base character.
    All other races are compared to them.  Humans can choose any class and are 
    average at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any other 
    race because of their shorter life spans.  No racial adjustments or 
    intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.

***** <Elf>
Elf
    The distant offspring of the union of Faery and human gene pools, Elves 
    carry the blood of Faery nobility.  Elves are intrinsically better 
    magicians then humans, but not as good at fighting.  They tend to be 
    smarter and faster than humans or and also have better wisdom and charisma.
    Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows, and 
    magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons or digging. Elves may 
    choose any class. They are resistant to attacks involving bright light.

***** <Dwarf>
Dwarf
    Whereas elves carry the blood of Faery nobility, dwarves descend from those
    humans impregnated by underground dwelling Faeries, and they too prefer 
    subterranean environs.  Dwarves are headstrong miners and fighters of 
    legend.  Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent
    choices for a warrior, paladin, priest or mystic.  Dwarves tend to be 
    stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than humans.  Because 
    they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they resist spells which are
    cast on them.  Dwarves also have very good infra-vision because they live
    underground, and are quite adept with a shovel. They do have one big 
    drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud 
    voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, screaming out 
    challenges at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves are miserable at
    stealth.  Just as comfortable relying on their hearing as on their eyes, 
    they can never be truly blinded. 

***** <Gnome>
Gnome
    The third race that boasts both human and Faery blood, gnomes originated 
    from the union of human and household Faery.  Their studious natures make
    them excellent mages, and they have very good saving throws.  They are 
    also good at searching, disarming, perception, alchemy, digging, and 
    stealth.  They have lower strength than humans so they are not very good at
    fighting with hand weapons, but are quite capable of using ranged attacks.
    As comfortable below ground as above it, gnomes have fair infra-vision, and
    are intrinsically protected against paralysis and some slowing effects.

***** <Grippli>
Grippli
    A young race with a simple tribal society, grippli are small amphibians, 
    resembling bipedal frogs. They are very good at bows, throwing, and have
    good saving throws.  Due to the large amount of predators in their native 
    swamps, they are quite skilled at stealth.  They're also skiiled in 
    alchemy, disarming, and perception.  They are normally much weaker than 
    humans, and no good at melee fighting.  Grippli resist water attacks and
    have their dexterity sustained.  They tend not to be warriors, paladins or
    spellswords; but those of them that leave their native homelands for more
    civilized places often find themselves as members of either thief guilds,
    or mystical monasteries, depending on their demeanor. They are naturally 
    protected against water-based attacks.
 
***** <Lizardman>
Lizardman
    Lizardmen are bipedal reptiles, standong about the same height as a human,
    with long, versatile necks.  They tend to live in any place where the air
    is warm, whether desert or jungle or swamp.  They are as bad as dwarves at
    stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.  Lizardmen 
    are quite primitive, and don't make friends often.  Lizardmen do make good
    warriors, for the simple reason that they tend to have great constitutions,
    good strength, and lots of hit points. Lizardmen naturally resist poison.
 
***** <Rattikin>
Rattikin
    The rattikin are a race of humanoid rats who live in the outskirts of human
    society.  Rattikin are very dexterous, and clever, but not very strong. 
    They are totally immune to the diseases that plague other races, and also 
    possess decent infra-vision. They make good warriors and rangers, and fine
    mages and spellswords, but their true calling is that of a thief.

***** <Felpurr>
Felpurr
    The most civilized of the animalistic races, the felpurr are a noble race 
    of humanoid felines, who live in large cities situated where the climate is
    warm.  They are dexterous and smart, but lack muscle strength.  They also 
    have limited infravision. They can play all classes well. Felpurr are 
    legendary for their luck - it somehow always seems that they manage to find
    the best loot during their travels and adventures.

***** <Ursa>
Ursa
    Large, lumbering, bear-people, they ursa are incredibly strong, and have 
    more hit points than any other character race.  They are also quite stupid
    and slow.  Living in cold, wooded regions, the ursa have a complex system 
    of inter-related hunter-gathering tribes.  They make great warriors, and 
    often are quite religious, making good priests and better paladins.  They
    are quite bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth, but decent
    at digging.  An ursa's idea of politeness is not beating everyone around 
    him to a pulp.  An ursa's thick fur protects it from cold attacks.

***** <Vargr>
Vargr
    Vargr are a race of intelligent, bipedal wolves, living in both cold and 
    temperate climes.  Their society resembles that of the ursa, but while the 
    former are somewhat brutish and primative, the vargr are guided by a deep-
    rooted code of honor. They have great stats, being strong, smart, and 
    quick.  They can be good in any class, but their natural obstinance makes
    them slow learners.   Vargr's constitution is inherently sustained.

***** <Kyrrus>
Kyrrus
    A rare sight out of their native mountains, kyrri are a deeply spiritual
    race of bipedal mountain goats.  Their society is arranged around secluded
    monasteries where the holy and magical arts are studied.  Only very few of
    the Kyrri choose a life away from these institutions, but those that do are
    known for their ability as mages, mystics and priests. While the Kyrri tend
    to prefer magical arts over physical prowess, there are those among them 
    who choose to combine might with religous faith and become paladins. Well 
    educated and wise, their wisdom is naturally sustained against attacks.

***** <Angel>
Angel
    Angels come from heaven to spread the causes of good, by any means 
    necessary.  While they start out as being rather weak and fragile, as they
    gain experience they are awarded new abilities and they eventually become 
    powerful in all regards. Angels possess special racial abilities.  Coming
    from a higher plane, the experiences of this world do not leave a strong 
    impression and them and they gain levels slowly. In addition, killing non-
    evil creatures may sometimes be necessary for their survival, but it goes
    against the basic fibre of their being and doing so provides them with only
    minimal experience rewards. During their time on this plane, they can 
    choose to belong to any trade - except, of course, thievery.

***** <Demon>
Demon
    Demons are the evil spawn of hell. Chaotic and unpredictable, some demons 
    realize that the quickest path to promotion is by destroying all their 
    rivals, and thus temporarily join the side of good to cleanse the dungeons
    of EyAngband. They are the weakest of the races at their creation, but 
    their abilities grow with their levels and they eventually gain immense 
    power.  From a certain level, Demons gain special racial abilities. Low 
    level demons are quite stealthy, but as they grow more powerful their 
    stealth rapidly decreases. Death and mayhem being commonplace to them, they
    gain levels slowly. They can play warriors, thieves, spellswords, mages and 
    rangers.

=== Races ===

There are twlelve different races that you can choose from in EyAngband.
Some races are restricted as to what profession they may be, and each race 
Has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. The race stat
adjustment lasts throughout the game, raising the maximum levels the character
can otherwise acheive in this stat. Most races also have intrinsic abilities.
 
          Human
               The human is the base character.  All other races are com-
               pared to them.  Humans can choose any class and are average
               at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any
               other race because of their shorter life spans.  No racial
               adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.
 
          Half-Elf
               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  but
               not as strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at searching,
               disarming, saving throws, stealth, bows, throwing, and magic,
               but they are not as good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may 
               choose any class and do not receive any intrinsic abilities.
 
          Elf
               Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
               fighting.  They tend to be smarter and faster than either
               humans or half-elves and also have better wisdom.  Elves
               are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows,
               and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons or digging.
               Elves may choose any class except Paladin. They are resistant
               to attacks involving bright light.
 
          Hobbit
               Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and 
               have good saving throws.  They also are very good at searching,
               alchemy, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They will be
               much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting.
               Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm
               creatures at a distance.  Hobbits can choose between being a
               warrior, mage, or ranger.  They have their dexterity sustained.
 
          Gnome
               Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings.
               They, like  the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like
               homes.  Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving
               throws.  They are good at searching, disarming, perception,
               alchemy, digging, and stealth.  They have lower strength than
               humans so they are not very good at fighting with hand weapons,
               but are quite capable of using ranged attacks.  Gnomes have
               fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures
               at a distance.  A gnome may choose between being a warrior,
               mage, or priest.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected against
               paralysis and some slowing effects.
 
          Dwarf
               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
               Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
               excellent choices for a warrior, paladin, priest or mystic.
               Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less
               intelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong and 
               are somewhat wise, they resist spells which are cast on them. 
               Dwarves also have very good infra-vision because they live
               Underground, and are quite adept with a shovel. They do have
               one big drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud,
               singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good
               reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In other
               words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.  They can never be
               blinded. 
 
          Half-Orc
               Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but
               are terrible at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
               and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.
               Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for
               goods in town.  Half-Orcs do make good warriors, for the 
               simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions
               and lots of hit points.  Because of their preference to living
               underground to on the surface, half-orcs resist darkness attacks.
 
          Half-Troll
               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points
               than any other character race.  They are also very stupid and
               slow.  They will make great warriors and iffy priests.  They
               are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth, but
               decent at digging. They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in
               their presence. They also happen to be fun to run...  Half-trolls
               always have their strength sustained.
 
          Dunadan
               Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder
               race surpasses human abilities in every field, especially
               constitution.  However, being men of the world, very little is
               new to them, and levels are very hard to gain...  They can
               play all classes.  Their constitution cannot be reduced.
 
          High-Elf
               High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard 
               and answered the call from the gods at the very beginning of 
               time, before the sun and moon were made, and lived in the 
               Blessed Realm for many thousands of years before returning to 
               mortal lands. Because of this, they are far superior in terms 
               of abilities when compared to their lesser Elven kindred, and 
               are able to be priests as well as all the other classes that 
               normal Elves can be. They can also see into the invisible
               world of ghosts and wraiths. However, they find new experience
               even harder to come by than Dunedain: and their wisdom is 
               still a little suspect. And like normal Elves, they resist
               attacks involving bright light.
 
          Angel
               Angels come from heaven to spread the causes of good, by any
               means necessary. While they start out as being rather weak and
               fragile, as they gain experience they are awarded new abilities
               and they eventually become powerful in all regards. Angels
               possess special racial abilities. Belonging to a higher plane,
               the experiences of this world do not leave a strong impression
               and them and they gain levels slowly. In addition, killing non-
               evil creatures may sometimes be necessary for their survival,
               but it goes against the basic fibre of their being and doing
               so provides them with only minimal experience rewards. Angels
               can play all classes.

          Demon
               Demons are the evil spawn of hell. Chaotic and unpredictable,
               some demons realize that the quickest path to promotion is by
               destroying all their rivals, and thus temporarily join the side
               of good in cleaning the dungeons of Angband. They are the weakest
               of the races at their creation, but their abilities grow with
               their levels and they eventually gain immense power. From a
               certain level, Demons possess special racial abilities. Low level
               demons are quite stealthy, but as they grow more powerful their
               stealth rapidly decreases. Death and mayhem being commonplace to
               them, they gain levels slowly. They can play warriors, mages and
               rangers.

          Nilbog
               The nilbog (sing. and plural) are a race shrouded in mystery. 
               They are slightly shorter than humans and totally hairless. No 
               one knowns whence they come from or why; even they themselves have
               no memory of their past. They accept this calmly, confident that 
               when the time will come for the purpose of their existance to be 
               known they shall be up to the task. They are creatures of unmagic, 
               and they disrupt the magic around them. This provides them with
               innate protection from mana based attacks, but they are barred 
               from most classes as spellcasting is incredibly difficult to them
               and magical weapons and armor that they weild will quickly lose its
               power.

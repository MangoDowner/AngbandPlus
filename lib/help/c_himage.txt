#####R=== High Mages ===

#####GDescription
High Mages are specialist Mages of the highest order. In most respects 
they are exactly like ordinary Mages, although their spell stat is 
slightly higher. Instead of selecting two realms of magic, a High Mage 
selects only one realm of magic and studies it extremely well, gaining 
substantial benefits in mana costs, minimum levels and failure rates.

#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (spellcasting stat)

#####GMagic Usage

the normal mages.

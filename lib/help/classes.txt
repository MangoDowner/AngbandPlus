=== Classes ===

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. For the first few
adventures it is suggested that you run a warrior.  Spellcasting generally
requires a more experienced player that is familiar with survival techniques.
Note that the class stat bonuses only take effect during character generation.

***** <Warrior>
Warrior
    A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems by
    cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of a
    magical device.  His primary stats are Strength and Dexterity, and a good
    Constitution can really help at times.  A Warrior will be good at fighting
    and shooting/throwing, but mediocre to bad at most other skills.

***** <Thief>
Thief
    A Thief is a professional criminal, attracted to the dungeon by the promise
    of hidden riches and great wealth.  She relies primarily on her Dexterity,
    which allows her to handle the delicate arts of trap placement, disarming,
    and avoidance.  While stealth is her main element, when things get rough 
    the thief can defend herself well.

        **************************************************************
        * NOTE - The Thief class is not yet properly implemented and *
        * playing one is not recommended!                            *
        **************************************************************

***** <Mage>
Mage
    A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to just hack his way through
    the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat, deceive, 
    confuse, and escape.  A mage is not really complete without an assortment
    of magical devices to use in addition to his spells.  He can master the 
    higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and has the best
    saving throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.  Intelligence is his
    primary stat, and determines his spellcasting ability.  Wearing heavy 
    armor, or most kinds of gloves, will severly damage his spellcasting 
    abilities, so while there is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good 
    fighter, most mages will prefer to rely on their spells.
 
***** <Spellsword>
Spellsword
    As indicated by her name, the spellsword can both fight and cast mage 
    spells.  She has similar fighting and shooting skills to the paladin, and
    unlike the ranger can access the full range of mage spellbooks, though she
    starts receiving them only at level 5.  She is the slowest of all classes 
    to advance.  Like a paladin, she has lousy stealth, perception,and 
    searching, though her skills with magical  devices and alchemy are decent,
    as is her saving throw.  Her primary stats are Strength, which she uses for
    fighting, and Intelligence, which governs her spellcasting prowess. 

***** <Ranger>
Ranger
    A Ranger is part warrior, part mage, and adds a few skills unique to him.
    He is a good fighter, and the best of all classes at firing a bow.  The
    ranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, and can only access some
    of the mage's spellbooks, but has an additional set of spells which only he
    can use.  Like all classes with mixed sets of skills, more experience is
    required for him to advance in levels.  A ranger has good stealth, good 
    perception, good searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical
    devices.  His primary stats are Intelligence (which determines his magical
    ability) and Dexterity.

***** <Priest>
Priest
    A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  She explores the dungeon only in
    order to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens
    to fall into her packs, well, so much more to the glory of her church!  The
    priest receives her spells from a deity, and therefore does not choose 
	which spells she will learn.  She is familiar with magical devices, 
	which she calls instruments of god, but is not as good as a mage in their 
	use.  A priest has good saving throws, and makes a decent fighter, 
	preferring blunt weapons over edged ones.  Wisdom is the priest's primary 
	stat, determining spellcasting ability.

***** <Paladin>
Paladin
    A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  He is a very good fighter, second only to 
    the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons.  He receives 
    prayers at a slower pace then the priest, but can receive even the most 
    powerful of prayers.  Because a paladin is really  a dual class  character,
    it takes more experience to advance him.  A paladin lacks much in the way
    of abilities.  He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical
    devices.  He has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance.  His 
    primary stats are Wisdom, which determines his magic ability, and Strength,
    which he uses for melee.

***** <Mystic>
Mystic
    A Mystic learns both the holy prayers of priests and the arcane magic of
    mages.  While she is the weakest fighter of all the classes, she gains 
    spells the fastest, and has the most mana.  A mystic relies almost only on
    her spells, and is not very good at activating magical items.  She is, 
    however, moderately skilled at throwing weapons at her enemies from afar.
    There are said to be rare spellbooks in the dungeon that teach her 
    discplines that lie beyond the scope of other classes.  Her primary stats
    are Wisdom and Intelligence, which combine to determine her spellcasting
    power.

***** <Bard>
Bard
    A bard is an artist.  He adventures neither for gold nor fame but for the
    value of the experience.  His fighting skills are decent, and he can use a
    variety of musical instruments to play magic tunes.  As he delves deeper in
    the dungeon, better quality instruments can be found which he can use to 
    play more powerful melodies.  The bard is a master of lore - he knows many
    legends of powerful artifacts and were he to find one of these, simple 
    knowledge of the artifact's name can be sufficient for him to know all of 
    its abilities.  The bard's primary stat is Charisma, which his musical 
    abilities depend on, and he can also use good Dexterity and Intelligence.

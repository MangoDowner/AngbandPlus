=== Classes ===

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. For the first few
adventures  it is suggested that you  run a warrior.  Spell casting generally
requires a more experienced player that is familiar with survival techniques.
Note that the class stat bonuses only affect character generation.
 
***** <Warrior>
          Warrior
               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
               his  problems  by cutting them to pieces, but will occasion-
               ally fall back  on the help of a magical device.  His  prime
               stats  are  Strength  and Constitution, and a good Dexterity
               can really help at times.  A Warrior will be good at  Fight-
               ing and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.
 
***** <Thief>
          Thief
               A Thief is a professional criminal, attracted to the dungeon
			   by the  promise of great riches.  He relies on his dexterity
			   and  intelligence, allowing him to handle  the delicate arts 
			   of trap  placement and avoidance.  While stealth is his main
			   element,  when things get rough he can defend  himself well.

***** <Mage>
          Mage
               A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
               his  way  through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his
               magic to defeat,  deceive, confuse, and escape.  A  mage  is
               not really complete without an assortment of magical devices
               to use in addition to his spells.  He can master the  higher
               level  magical  devices far easier than anyone else, and has
               the best saving throw to resist effects of  spells  cast  at
               him.  Intelligence is his primary stat,  and determines his 
               spellcasting ability.  Wearing heavy armor, or most kinds of
               gloves,  will severly damage his spellcasting abilities,  so
               While there is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good 
               fighter, most mages will prefer to rely on their spells.
 
***** <Spellsword>
         Spellsword
               As indicated by his name,  the spellsword can both fight and
               cast mage spells.  He has similar (though slightly inferior)
               fighting and shooting skills to the paladin,  and unlike the
               ranger can access the full range of mage spellbooks,  though
               he starts receivnig them only at level 5.  He is the slowest
               of all  classes to advance.  Like a paladin,  he has  lousey
               stealth, perception, and searching,  though his skills  with
               magical  devices and  alchemy are decent,  as is his  saving
               throw.  His primary stats  are Strength,  which  he uses for 
               fighting, and Intelligence, which he uses for spellcasting. 

***** <Ranger>
          Ranger
               A Ranger is a warrior/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  the
               best  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.
               The ranger learns spells much more slowly than a  mage,  but
               is  capable  of  learning all  but the most powerful spells.
               Because a ranger is really  a  dual  class  character,  more
               experience  is  required for him to advance.  A ranger has a
               good stealth, good perception, good searching, a good saving
               throw,  and is good with magical devices.  His primary stats
               are Intelligence (which determines his spellcasting ability)
               and Dexterity.

***** <Priest>
          Priest
               A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  the
               dungeon  only  to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
               treasure just happens to fall into  their  packs,  well,  so
               much  more  to  the  glory of their church!  Priests receive
               their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose which
               spells they will learn.  They are familiar with magical dev-
               ices, preferring to call them instruments of  god,  but  are
               not  as good as a mage in their use.  Priests have good sav-
               ing throws,  and  make  decent  fighters,  preferring  blunt
               weapons  over  edged  ones.  Wisdom  is the priest's primary
               stat, determining spellcasting ability.
 
***** <Paladin>
          Paladin
               A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,
               second  only to the warrior class, but not very good at mis-
               sile weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace then the
               priest,  but  can receive even the  most  powerful  prayers.
               Because a paladin is  really  a  dual  class  character,  it
               requires  more  experience  to advance him.  A paladin lacks
               much in the way of abilities.  He is poor at  stealth,  per-
               ception,  searching,  and  magical devices.  He has a decent
               saving throw due to his divine alliance.  His primary  stats
               are Wisom , which determines his magic ability, and Strength
               which he uses for melee.
 

***** <Mystic>
          Mystic
               A Mystic  learns both  the holy  prayers of priests  and the 
               magic of mages.  While he is the  weakest fighter of all the 
               classes, he gains spells the fastest, and has the most mana.
               A mystic  relies almost only on his spells,  and is not very 
               good at activating magical items.  He is, however, moderatly
               skilled at throwing weapons at his enemies from afar.  There 
               are said to be rare spellbooks in the dungeon that teach him
               discplines  that lie beyond the scope of other classes.  His 
               primary stats are Wisdom and Intelligence,  which combine to 
               determine his spellcasting power.

***** <Bard>
          Bard
               A bard is an artist. He adventures neither for gold nor fame
               but for the value of the experience. His fighting skills are
               decent, and he can use  a variety of musical  instruments to
               play magic tunes. As he delves deeper in the dungeon, better
               quality instruments can be  found which  he can  use to play
               more powerful melodies. The bard is a  master of lore  -  he
               knows many legends of powerful artifacts and were he to find
               one of these, simple knowledge of the artifact's name can be
               sufficient for him to know all of its abilities.  The bard's
               primary stat is Charisma, which his musical abilities depend
               on, and he can also use good Dexterity and Intelligence.

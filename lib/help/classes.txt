=== Classes ===

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. For the first 
few adventures it is suggested that you run a warrior. Spell casting 
generally requires a more experienced player that is familiar with survival
techniques. Note that the class stat bonuses only affect character generation.
 
          Warrior
               A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
               his  problems  by cutting them to pieces, but will occasion-
               ally fall back  on the help of a magical device.  His  prime
               stats  are  Strength  and Constitution, and a good Dexterity
               can really help at times.  A Warrior will be good at  Fight-
               ing and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.
 
          Mage
               A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
               his  way  through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his
               magic to defeat,  deceive, confuse, and escape.  A  mage  is
               not really complete without an assortment of magical devices
               to use in addition to his spells.  He can master the  higher
               level  magical  devices far easier than anyone else, and has
               the best saving throw to resist effects of  spells  cast  at
               him.  Intelligence is his primary stat, and determines his 
               spellcasting ability. There is no rule that says a mage 
               cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.
 
          Priest
               A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  the
               dungeon  only  to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if
               treasure just happens to fall into  their  packs,  well,  so
               much  more  to  the  glory of their church!  Priests receive
               their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose which
               spells they will learn.  They are familiar with magical dev-
               ices, preferring to call them instruments of  god,  but  are
               not  as good as a mage in their use.  Priests have good sav-
               ing throws,  and  make  decent  fighters,  preferring  blunt
               weapons  over  edged  ones.  Wisdom  is the priest's primary
               stat, determining spellcasting ability.
 
          Ranger
               A Ranger is a warrior/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  the
               best  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.
               The ranger learns spells much more slowly than a  mage,  but
               is  capable  of  learning all  but the most powerful spells.
               Because a ranger is really  a  dual  class  character,  more
               experience  is  required for him to advance.  A ranger has a
               good stealth, good perception, good searching, a good saving
               throw,  and is good with magical devices.  His primary stats
               are Intelligence (which determines his spellcasting ability)
               and Dexterity.
 
          Paladin
               A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,
               second  only to the warrior class, but not very good at mis-
               sile weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace then the
               priest,  but  can receive even the  most  powerful  prayers.
               Because a paladin is  really  a  dual  class  character,  it
               requires  more  experience  to advance him.  A paladin lacks
               much in the way of abilities.  He is poor at  stealth,  per-
               ception,  searching,  and  magical devices.  He has a decent
               saving throw due to his divine alliance.  His primary  stats
               are Wisom and Charisma, which combine to determine his magic
               ability, and Strength which he uses for melee.
 

          Mystic
               A Mystic learns both the holy prayers of priests and the 
               magic of mages. While he is the weakest fighter among all the 
               classes, he gains spells the quickest, and has the most mana.
               A mystic relies almost only on his spells, and is not very 
               good at activating magical items. He is, however, moderatly
               skilled at throwing weapons at his enemies from afar. There 
               are said to be rare spellbooks in the dungeon that teach the
               mystic discplines that lie beyond the scope of other classes.
               His primary stats are Wisdom and Intelligence, which combine
               to determine his spellcasting power.

          Bard
               A bard is an artist. He adventures not for the riches or fame
               but for the value of the experience. His fighting skills are 
               decent, and he can use a variety of musical instruments to play
               magic tunes. The deeper into the dungeon he delves, better 
               quality instruments can be found which will enable him to play
               more powerful melodies. The bard is a master of lore - he knows
               many legends of powerful artifacts, and were he to find one of 
               these, simple knowledge of the artifacts name will be sufficient
               for him to know all its abilities. The bard's primary stat is
               Charisma, which his musical abilities depend on, and he also 
               benefits from good Dexterity and Intelligence.

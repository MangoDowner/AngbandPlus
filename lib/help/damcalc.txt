DAMAGES CALCULATIONS FORMULAS
-------------------------------

This document explains how damages are calculated. This will
help you build a better character out of these formulas. Note
that these explains the basic weapons formulas, and that using
certains abilities or item powers, you may get higher or lower
damages.

MELEE WEAPONS:

(((Base damages roll * 3) * weapon skill) + weapon to_d) * multiplier

So a character with 30 Strength(multiplier = 2), 50 sword skill
and using a Long Sword(+0, +0) will do at least 1000 damages, and can
do up to 5000. Note that this is the base weapon damages, and that
melee attacks also add your natural to_d and branded weapons bonuses
to these damages. When looking for a good melee weapon, try finding
one with the highest base damages for maximum damages!

RANGED WEAPONS:

(Base ammo damages roll + ammo's to_d + launcher's to_d) * (shooting
skill + launcher's mult) * shooters multiplier.

A character with 30 dexterity(shooters multiplier = 2), 50 shooting
skill using a long bow(x3, +0, +0) and arrows(1d4, +0, +0) will do
at least 106 damages and can do up to 424. However, if the character
uses a long bow(x3, +15, +15) and arrows(1d4, +10, +10), he/she can do
at least 2756 and up to 3074. Unlike melee weapons, the to_d bonus
is very important when using ranged weapons!

ATTACK SPELLS

(Spell's power/level) + 6% damages per spellcraft points.

This formula apply to all magic attack abilities as well. So a level 40
character casting a spell that does 20 damages/level with a spellcraft
skill of 0 will do 800 damages. With a spellcraft skill of 50, the
character will do 3200 damages. If you use a lot of magical damages
abilities or spells, have a high spellcraft skill.

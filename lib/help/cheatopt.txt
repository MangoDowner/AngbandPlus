=== Cheating options ===

Cheating options are there for those players who feel that the game is too 
difficulty, or for those who want to know more about the internal machinations
behind the game. Using any of these options marks the savefile, and will 
prevent the character from ever achieving a high-score - even if the option
is later turned off. So use these options with caution.

Shamanism
=========

The power of shamanism is that of the spirits. The shaman makes pacts
with various spirits and then calls on them for aid. The spirits will
perform favours for the shaman when asked, as this is their side of the
pact. However, they will only co-operate when calm. Asking for favours
too often will anger them and they may even take retribution on the
shaman who annoys them.

Shamans must give the spirits time to calm down after each favour is
granted - and the more powerful the favour, the longer the spirit will
take to calm down. However, having more knowledge in the ways of the
spirits will allow the shaman to anger spirits less. Being charismatic
will also help keep the spirits calm.

Requirements
============

Before a shaman can ask favours from a spirit, he or she must first form
a ritual pact with the spirit. This can be done at any temple, although
the prospective shaman must be aware that the rituals involved can be
very gruelling - especially for the more powerful spirits.

However, once the pact is in place, the shaman can call upon the spirit
at any time unless confused. There are no limitations from equipment or
reading ability.

Usage
=====

You can call upon a spirit at any time except when in a shop or
confused. To do so, press the 'p' key, then select which spirit you wish
to call upon and which favour you wish from it.

Abilities
=========

Whilst there are many spirits, they can be broken down easily into the
type of spirit (Spirits of Life or Spirits of The Wild) and the power of
the spirit (minor, lesser, greater or major). The spirits and the
favours that they grant are listed below (as well as the minimum skill
needed to persuade the spirit to grant each favour).

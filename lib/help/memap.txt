=================== "Map" of Middle Earth =======================

Below is a rough diagram of the linkages between the regions of Middle
Earth which your character can visit.  Dungeons are shown in brackets under
the region where their entrance lies (Nan Dungortheb is not strictly a dungeon,
but acts like one in some ways).  Some towns are clearly marked; for the
others and for a description of towns, see "town.txt".  For more information
about wilderness and dungeons, see "wild-dun.txt".  Note that the routes
marked with *s are only available in the compressed_map (default) option.

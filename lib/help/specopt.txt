=== Special options ===

In addition to the regular, birth, and cheating options, there exist special 
options that can be used to modify the game to your liking.

The "hitpoint_warn" value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints
at which the player is warned that he may die.  It is also used as the cut-off
for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.

The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects used
for missile, bolt, beam, and ball attacks.  The actual time delay is equal to
"delay_factor" cubed, in milliseconds.

=== Item squelch ===

The item squelch menu allows you to define what you view as junk.  It makes
the game more enjoyable by reducing the amount of time the you spend 
sifting through large piles of mostly useless items.

There are three ways in which items may be squelched. The first is called
squelch-by-type. In order to use this option, first you must choose one
of the object type menus available. Once the appropriate menu has been 
reached, you may toggle a bit that tells whether the object type is to 
be squelched or not. Note that, In order to prevent (as much as possible) 
the squelch menus from giving away too much information about the game the 
actual name of an object will not appear until the character (or a different 
character on the same savefile) has seen and identified at least one example
of the object.  

The second way in which items may be squelched occurs after the item is 
(pseudo)-identified.  Once you are aware of an item's quality, 
the item may be squelched if the quality isn't good enough.  This type 
of squelching is called squelch-by-quality. The squelch-by-quality menu
is reached by pressing 'Q' from the main item squelch menu. 

The third way is squelching junk.  You can turn squelching junk on by pressing
'J' on the main squelch menu.  If it is on, all junk (items that can't be sold
in the stores) will be squelched.

Once an item is squelched, it will be inscribed with "squelch".  Pressing 'k'
and then '!' will destroy all squelched items you are carrying and that are
on the floor below you.  If you want to automate this, turn on automatic 
squelching by pressing 'A' in the main squelch menu - this will cause the 
game to automatically destroy any squelched item.  This destruction is 
irreversible, so take care.

=== Window flags ===

Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which can be used to
display useful information generally available through other means.  The best
thing about these windows is that they are updated automatically (usually) to
reflect the current state of the world.  The "window options" can be used to
specify what should be displayed in each window.  The possible choices should
be pretty obvious.

Display inven/equip
    Display the player inventory (and sometimes the equipment).

Display equip/inven
    Display the player equipment (and sometimes the inventory).

Display player (basic info)
    Display a brief description of the character, including a breakdown
    of the current player "skills" (including attacks/shots per round).

Display player (flags & resists)
    Display a brief description of the character's special abilities,
	including a breakdown of the contributions of each equipment item 
	to the various resistances and other abilities.

Display current player condition
    Display a list of temporary effects such as poisoning and protection from 
	evil.

Display visible monsters
    Displays a color-coded list of all monsters in LOS. "Unknown" (no similar
    monster has been killed) monsters are grey, "known" monsters are violet
    if out-of-depth or white otherwise. Uniques are always light red. Note
    that using this display makes the game somewhat easier, and makes monsters
    that are disguised as objects/floors somewhat pointless, so use it at
    your own discretion.
    
Display messages
    Display the most recently generated "messages".

Display overhead view
    Display an overhead view of the entire dungeon.  This is very slow
    and does not even look very good.

Display monster recall
    Display a description of the most monster which has been most recently
    attacked, targetted, or examined in some way.

Display object recall
    Display a description of the most recently selected object.  This window 
	flag may be usefully combined with others, such as "monster recall".

Display room descriptions
    Whenever you enter a room, a short description of it will appear in this
	window. It has no real game effect, though it can provide you with some
	hints of the room's contents.

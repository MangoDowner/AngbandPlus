=== Attacking and Being Attacked ===
 
Attacking is simple in Angband.  If you move into a creature, you attack it.
You can attack from a distance by firing a missile or by magical means (such
as aiming a wand).  Creatures attack in the same way.  If they move into you,
they attack you.  Some creatures can also cast spells from a distance, and
others can use various breath weapons (such as fire) on you from a distance.

Creatures in walls can not be attacked by wands or other magic attacks
normally stopped by walls.  Tunneling into the wall (using the "tunnel"
or "alter" command) will allow you to attack any creature in the wall.

If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the weapon is used when you hit
a creature.  Otherwise you get a single punch which does minimal damage.

You may wield both a primary weapon for melee combat, and a bow or other
missile launcher for launching missiles at the same time (along with a
light, an amulet, two rings, a helmet, boots, gloves, a shield, a cloak, and
body armor).  Be sure not to try and kill a dragon with a shovel, it makes
you look silly and probably won't work...
 
Firing a missile (while wielding the appropriate launcher) is the only way to
get the "full" power out of the missile.  You may of course throw an arrow at
a monster without shooting it, but you will find the effects may not be what
you had hoped.

Hits and misses are determined by ability to hit versus armor class.  A "hit"
is a strike that does some damage: a "miss" may either have missed the target 
completely, or simply hit it but failed to do any damage, such as your sword
being deflected of a goblin's armor or your arrow rattling uselessly against
a dragon's hide. Higher armor classes make it harder to do damage, and so lead 
to more such "misses": they also reduce the damage from a successful "hit". 

=== Monster Memories ===

There are hundreds of different creatures in the pits of Angband, many of
which have the same letter symbol and color on the screen.  The exact species
of a creature can be discovered by looking at it.  It is also very difficult
to keep track of the capabilities of various creatures.  Luckily, Angband
automatically keeps track of your experiences with a particular creature.
This feature is called the monster memory.  You monster memory recalls the
particular attacks of each creature which you have faced, as well as recalling 
if you have observed them to multiply or move erratically, or drop treasure, 
etc.  Otherwise you would simply have to take notes, which is an unnecessary 
bother. (It should be noted that the items known as a Staff or Rod of Probing
will tell you the hit points of a monster, and what it resists - and therefore
what attacks it does *not* resist, so you may use such an item on a dragon 
breathes fire and be told - if you did not already guess - that it resists
fire, but does not resist frost attacks, so you know to use a cold attack.)

If you have killed enough of a particular creature, or suffered enough
attacks, recalling the monster memory may also provide you with information
not otherwise available, such as a armor class or hit dice.  These are not
explained, but may be useful to give the relative danger of each creature.
This memory can be passed on to a new character even after you die, by means
of a reduced save file.
 

=== Your Weapon ===

Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you no good.  You must wield a weapon 
before it can be used in a fight.  A secondary weapon can be kept by keeping
it in the backpack, and switching it with the primary weapon when needed.

Weapons have two main magical characteristics, their enchanted ability to hit
and their enchanted ability to do damage, expressed as `(+#,+#)'.  A normal
weapon would be `(+0,+0)'.  Many weapons in Angband have bonuses to hit
and/or do damage.  Some weapons are cursed, and have penalties that hurt the
player.  Cursed weapons cannot be unwielded until the curse is lifted.
Identifying a weapon will inform you of the magical bonuses and penalties
and whether or not it is cursed.

Angband assumes that your youth in the rough environment near the dungeons
has taught you the relative merits of different weapons, and displays as
part of their description the damage dice which define their capabilities.
Any damage enchantment is added to the dice roll for that weapon.  The dice
used for a given  weapon is displayed as "#d#".  The first number indicates
how many dice to roll, and the second indicates how many sides they have.  A
"2d6" weapon will give damage from 2 to 12, plus any damage bonus.  The
weight of a weapon is also a consideration.  Heavy weapons may hit harder,
but they are also harder to use.  Depending on your strength, dexterity,
character class, and weapon weight, you may get several attacks per turn: 
warriors may get 6, mages are limited to 4, other classes are allowed up to
5, and having a weapon that provides extra attacks increases this limit.

Missile booster weapons, such as bows, have their characteristics added to
those of the missile used, if the proper weapon/missile combination is used, 
i.e. rounded pebbles or iron shots from a Sling, arrows or seeker arrows from
a Short or Long Bow, bolts or seeker bolts from a Light or Heavy Crossbow. If 
you are wielding the wrong launcher or no launcher, you will find that throwing
arrows simply doesn't work very well. Rangers may get more than one shot per
turn with Bows, but not Slings or Crossbows: any class may also get extra shots
with a missile launcher of Extra Shots. (You do not fire two arrows at once
in this manner: what happens is that the shot takes half the time that it 
would normally take, so if you are firing arrows with 1 extra shot per turn,
against a monster which moves at twice your speed, it will move *one* space in 
between each arrow fired.)

Although you receive any magical bonuses an unidentified weapon may possess
when you wield it, those bonuses will not be added in to the displayed
values of to-hit and to-dam on your character sheet.  You must identify the
weapon before the displayed values reflect the real values used.

Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities.  These are called ego
weapons, and are feared by great and meek.  An ego weapon must be wielded
to receive the benefit of its abilities.

Ego weapons are denoted by the following "names":  

(Defender)
     A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder defend himself, thus
     increasing his/her armour class, and protecting him/her against damage
     from fire, cold, acid, lightning, and falls.  This weapon also will
     increase your stealth, let you see invisible creatures, protect you
     from paralyzation and some slowing attacks, and help you regenerate hit
     points and mana faster.  As a result of the regeneration ability, you
     will use up food somewhat faster than normal while wielding such a
     weapon.  These powerful weapons also will sustain one stat, though this
     stat will vary from weapon to weapon.

(Holy Avenger)
     A Holy Avenger is one of the more powerful of weapons.  A Holy Avenger
     will increase your wisdom and your armour class.  This weapon will do
     extra damage when used against evil, demonic and undead creatures, and
     will also give you the ability to see invisible creatures.  These
     weapons are basically extremely powerful versions of Blessed Blades
     and can be wielded by priests with no penalty. These weapons will make
     the character fearless and also sustain one random stat.

(Blessed Blade)
     A blessed blade will increase your wisdom.  If you are a priest,
     wielding a non-blessed sword or polearm causes a small penalty while
     attacking and may infuriate your god, decreasing the chances that he
     will accept your prayers: but a priest may wield a blessed weapon 
     without penalty. Blessed blades also have one other random power, which
     may be telepathy, see invisible, free action, slow digestion, hold 
     life, regeneration, or in general anything that is not a resistance,
     elemental brand or a power of slaying certain types of creature.

Weapon of Westernesse
     A Weapon of Westernesse is one of the more powerful weapons.  It slays
     orcs, trolls, and giants, while increasing your strength, dexterity, 
     and constitution.  It also lets you see invisible creatures and protects 
     from paralyzation and some slowing attacks.  These blades were made by 
     the Dunedain.

Weapon of Extra Attacks.
     A weapon of extra attacks will allow the wielder to deliver extra
     attacks during each round.

Elemental Branded Weapons.
     Each of the four "elemental" attacks of acid, lightning, fire and cold
     has a corresponding weapon which will do treble damage against creatures 
     not resistant to that element. These weapons are labelled as being of 
     "Acid", "Flame", "Frost" and "Lightning". 
     
     It should be noted that only the base weapon damage is multiplied 
     against non-resistant creatures, not the magical damage bonus. 
     So a Long Sword of Flame (2d5) (+6,+7) does 2d5+7 points of damage to 
     fire-resistant creatures, and 6d5+7 points to creatures which do not 
     resist fire: NOT 6d5+21.

Weapons of Slaying.
     There are eight types of this: Slay Orc, Slay Dragon, Slay Undead, 
     Slay Demon, Slay Giant, Slay Dragon, Slay Evil and Slay Animal.
     "Slay Evil" and "Slay Animal" affect more creatures than the rest do,
     but these only do double damage: the other "slaying" weapons do 
     triple damage to the right kind of monster. As with elemental 
     brands, only the base weapon damage is doubled, not the magical
     damage bonus.

     Another important fact is that only the highest modifier applies, 
     in the case of a weapon with more than one slay or elemental brand:
     a weapon that has frost brand (x3 against creatures that do not resist
     cold) and slay evil (x2 against evil creatures) will do x3 damage 
     against an evil creature that does not resist cold, not x6 damage.
     Likewise, a Holy Avenger weapon used against an evil demon will only 
     get the x3 bonus for slay demon, not the x2 bonus for slay evil as well.
     
Weapons of *Slaying*
     These provide the standard slaying bonuses, plus something extra, 
     as follows:
     *Slay Dragon* - does FIVE times base damage against dragonkind, and
        boosts constitution.
     *Slay Evil* - boosts your wisdom, and is blessed, so priests may use it.
     *Slay Animal* - boosts intelligence, and allows faster regeneration.
     *Slay Undead* - boosts your wisdom and allows you to see invisible 
        monsters: because many undead are invisible.
     *Slay Orc* - will boost the wielder's dexterity.
     *Slay Troll* - will boost your strength.
     *Slay Giant* - will boost your strength.
     *Slay Demon* - will boost your intelligence and give you resistance to
        fire, which is the main weapon of many demons.
 
Weapon of Morgul.
     This blade is made with the sorcery of the undead. It is foully 
     cursed with evil, with a greater curse than standard scrolls of 
     Remove Curse can dispel. It has power over the undead, to the extent
     of permitting you to see invisible (which many undead creatures are), 
     slaying undead, and protecting you against most forms of having your
     experience drained: there is no other non-artifact source that gives
     resistance to nether forces. However, there is a terrible price: the 
     weapon itself will drain your very soul and experience - slowly, but
     permanently. And as if that were not enough, use of one will alert 
     the denizens of the netherworld to your presence.

Shovels of Digging.
     These powerful diggers are branded with acid, all the better for 
     digging through the walls of the dungeon.

Ego Missile Launchers and Ammo:
-------------------------------
Launchers of Accuracy.
    These launchers have an unnaturally high to-hit number, making them 
    extremely accurate.

Launchers of Power.
    These launchers do an unnaturally high amount of damage due to their 
    high to-damage number.

Launchers of Extra Shots.
    These launchers allow the wielder to shoot more times per round than 
    normal.

Launchers of Extra Might.
    These launchers have a higher damage multiplier than normally made 
    launchers of their type: the bonus in brackets (+1 or +2) is added 
    to the multiplier of the weapon. So a Heavy Crossbow of Extra Might
    (x4)(+1) is actually a Heavy Crossbow (x5). 
    
    It should be noted here that the damage multiplier for the bow, unlike 
    any slaying or elemental brand bonuses or any to-dam bonus, is applied 
    after all the damage has been added together. To clarify, consider this:

       Seeker arrows of Flame (4d4) (+9,+8) fired from a Long Bow of
       Extra Might (x3)(+11,+12) (+2)...

       Each arrow does 4d4=4-16 points of damage normally, average 10.
       If fired against a non-fire-resistant monster, triple damage: 
         12d4=12-48, average 30.

       You have a to-hit bonus adjusted by both the launcher and the
         missile, to give both +9 and +11 = +20 to-hit, plus any bonus
         you have from your dexterity. All in all, that's a pretty good
         chance of hitting...

       Add the damage bonus of the weapon, and the damage bonus of the 
         bow - +8 and +12, to give a total of +20. 
            Running total: 24-36 against fire-resistant, 32-68 against
            other monsters, average 30 and 50 respectively.
       Multiply by the bow multiplier: this is (x5) as the normal (x3)
         has a (+2) bonus,
            Final total: 120-180 against fire-resistant monsters, 
            160-340 otherwise, average 150 and 250 respectively, 
            considering a successful hit.

    It can be seen that missile weapons can be pretty powerful. But arrows
    may break, whether they miss or hit their target, so not every arrow can 
    be recovered. You also need a clear line of sight to the creature you are
    shooting, and many monsters are not considerate enough to provide this, 
    preferring to summon their minions to surround the player.

Ammo of Slay Animal, Undead, Dragon, Giant, Demon, Evil.
    This ammo has the same bonuses as a melee weapon - double base damage for 
    Slay Animal against animals or Slay Evil against evil monsters, treble
    damage otherwise against the specified type of monster. Unlike melee
    weapons, there is no more powerful *slaying* ammo.

Ammo of Flame, Frost, Acid, Lightning
    This ammo, as with melee weapons, trebles the damage against monsters
    not resistant to the attack.

Ammo of Wounding.
    This ammo has an unnaturally good chance to hit, and does extra damage
    even compared to normal magical ammo.

Apart from these there are some very rare and well made blades in the
dungeon with not necessarily any special abilities. These include Blades
of Chaos, Maces of Disruption, and Scythes of Slicing.  They can also be
ego weapons like the ones above.  For example, a Blade of Chaos (Holy
Avenger) is much more powerful than many artifact weapons!

There are rumors of incredibly rare "artifact" weapons which are even
more powerful than ego weapons. Some are, of course, bound to be overrated...


=== Your Armor Class ===

Your armor class (or AC) is a number that describes the amount and the
quality of armor being worn. Armor class will generally run from about 0 to
150, but could become negative or greater than 150 with rarer armour or by
magical means.
 
The larger your armor class, the more protective it is.  A negative armor
class would actually help get you hit.  Armor protects you in three manners.
One, it makes you harder to be hit for damage.  A hit for no damage is the
same as a miss.  Two, good armor will absorb some of the damage that your
character would have taken from normal attacks.  Three, acid damage is
reduced by wearing body armor (but the armor will be damaged instead).  It
is obvious that a high armor class is a must for surviving the deeper levels
of Angband.

Each piece of armour has a base armor value, which, like the damage from
weapons, is assumed known by the player, and a magic bonus, which will not
be displayed unless the armor has been identified or was bought in a store.

Armor class values are always displayed between a set of brackets as "[#]"
or "[#,+#]".  The first value is the armor class of the item.  The second
number is the magical bonus of the item which is only displayed if known,
and will always have a sign preceding the value.  Note that a few rings,
amulets, and weapons also have the "[+#]" notation, indicating that they
provide an armor bonus.  Many pieces of heavy body armor will also have a
"(-#)" before the "[#,+#]", which indicates that the weight of the armor
decreases your chances of hitting monsters.  This can range from nonexistent
for very light armor to (-8) for the very heaviest armor!

Some pieces of armor will possess special abilities denoted by the following
names:

Ego Armors and Shields:
-----------------------
of Resist Acid.
     A character using such an object will take only one third normal damage
     from any acid thrown upon him.  In addition, armor so enchanted will
     resist the acid's effects and not be damaged by it.
 
of Resist Lightning.
     A character using a resist lightning object will take only one third
     damage from electrical attacks.
 
of Resist Fire.
     A character using a resist fire object will take only one third damage
     from heat and fire. 
 
of Resist Cold.
     A character using a resist cold object will take only one third damage
     from frost and cold.
 
of Resistance.
     A character wearing armor with this ability will have resistance to
     Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained in each part above.

     *A note on Resistances*
        The character may get resistance to a number of different attacks.
     However, having more than one permanent source of resistance is no
     better than having one source: a character with both Armor and Shield 
     of Resist Fire is no better off than if only one of these items provided
     the resistance.
        However, having a temporary source of resistance to fire, cold, 
     lightning, acid or poison *is* useful (this may be obtained by a potion
     or spell, or the activation of certain rare items.) A character who has 
     both permanent and temporary resistance to an attack form will take only
     1/9 of the damage he would take normally. Of course, temporary resistance 
     will run out eventually, so beware of relying on it...
 
of Elvenkind.
     This is the same as Resistance armour, only generally better enchanted.
     It will make you more stealthy.  This armor also possesses one extra 
     resistance beyond the four basic elemental ones found on armor of 
     Resistance (i.e. fire, acid, lightning, cold), and a more certain means
     of identification than the standard scroll of Identify will be needed to
     find out which resistance it is. It will come from the following list:
     poison, light, dark, blindness, confusion, nexus, fear, nether, chaos,
     disenchantment, shards, sound.
 
Robes of Permanence.
     These robes are designed especially for wizards.  Just like Elvenkind
     armor, they provide resistance to fire, cold, acid, and electricity and
     cannot be damaged by acid.  They sustain all of your stats and protect
     you from a good deal of all experience draining.  Also like Elvenkind
     armor, they have an additional special resistances  These robes are
     so good that their owners are rarely killed, perhaps explaining the
     incredible rarity.

Dragon Scale Mails.
     These extremely rare pieces of armour come in many different colors,
     each protecting you against the relevent dragons.  Naturally they are
     all resistant to acid damage.  They also occasionally allow you to
     breathe as a dragon would!

Ego Helms:
----------
Stat Boosting Helms.
     There are magical helms found in the dungeon that have the ability
     to boost the wearer's intelligence, wisdom, or charisma.  Helms of 
     Beauty are the ones that boost charisma.  In addition to boosting 
     the relevant stat these helms will also prevent that stat from being 
     drained.

Helm of the Magi.
     This is the great helm of the wizards.  The wearer will have an
     increased (and sustained) intelligence, and will also be given 
     resistance against fire, frost, acid, and lightning.  These valuable
     helms may also have additional properties.

Helm of Might.
     This is the great helm of the warriors.  The wearer will have an
     increased and sustained strength, dexterity, and constitution, 
     and will also be immune to any foe's attempt to slow, paralyze or 
     scare them.

Helm of Lordliness.
     This is the great helm of the priests.  The wearer will have an
     increased and sustained wisdom and charisma.

Helm of Seeing.
     This is the great helm of the rogues.  The wearer will be able to see
     even invisible creatures, and will have an increased ability to locate
     traps and secret doors.  It is also rumored that the wearer of such a
     helm will not be able to be blinded, and can see in the dark by seeing
     the heat given off by enemies - infravision.

Helm of Serenity.
     This helm grants the wearer the chance to keep his mind clear of all 
     distractions, noises and confusions of life, whether natural or 
     magical. In practical terms, this translates into resistance to sound,
     fear and confusion.

Helm of Light.
     In addition to providing a permanent light source for the wearer, this 
     helm also provides resistance against light-based attacks.

Helm of Telepathy.
     This helm grants the wearer the power of telepathy.

Helm of Regeneration.
     This helm will help you regenerate hit points and mana more quickly
     than normal, allowing you to fight longer before needing to rest.  You
     will use food faster than normal while wearing this helm because of
     the regenerative effects.
 
Ego Cloaks:
-----------
Cloak of Protection.
     This finely made cloak will come with an unnaturally high enchantment
     and is not affected by elemental based attacks. It is also fairly well
     woven and will protect the wearer from blasts of crystal shards.

Cloak of Stealth.
     This cloak will increase the wearer's stealth, making the wearer less
     likely to wake up sleeping monsters.

Cloak of Aman.
     These exceptionally rare cloaks have an extremely high armor bonus, 
     a bonus to stealth and provide an extra random resistance!

Ego Gloves:
-----------
Gloves of Free Action.
     The wearer of these gloves will find himself resistant to paralyzing
     attacks as well as some slowing attacks.  Because of the special 
     nature of these gloves, magic users may wear these gloves without
     incurring a mana penalty.   

Gloves of Slaying.
     These gloves will increase the wearer's fighting ability by boosting
     the wearer's to-hit and to-dam values.

Gloves of Agility.
     These gloves will increase the wearer's dexterity.  Because of the 
     special nature of these gloves, magic users may wear these gloves 
     without incurring a mana penalty.   

Gloves of Power.
     These gloves will boost the wearer's strength as well as the wearer's
     to-hit and to-dam numbers.

Ego Boots:
----------
Boots of Slow Descent.
     These boots protect the wearer from the effects of small falls.

Boots of Stealth.
     These boots increase the wearer's stealth, like a Cloak of Stealth.

Boots of Free Action.
     The wearer of these boots will find himself resistant to paralyzing
     attacks as well as some slowing attacks.

Boots of Speed.
     The wearer of these boots will become unnaturally quick!

Apart from these there are some very rare, and well made armours in the
dungeon with not necessarily any special abilities. These include Shields of
Deflection, Adamantite Plate Mail, Mithril Plate Mail, Mithril Chain Mail,
and Shadow Cloaks.  The first four cannot be damaged by acid because of the
quality metals they contain.

There are rumors of incredibly rare "artifact" armor which are even
more powerful than ego armor. Again, some of these are great: others may be 
less powerful and somewhat overrated, but are still made well enough that it 
is beyond mortal efforts to actually destroy them.

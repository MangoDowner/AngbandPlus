The Great Outdoors
=== ===== ========

Cthangband has a collection of towns, towers, and dungeons set in a wilderness map, which must be traversed to get from one to another. Each dungeon and tower has at least one guardian, and the sewers of several towns also have guardians.  In order to win the game, all guardians must be defeated.

Shops
=====

Shops are found in towns.  Most of them have a variety of items to sell, already fully identified and ready to examine, and will buy such items from players (although they insist on making a profit).  Shopkeepers are of various races, and have various levels of racial tolerance and greed. All shopkeepers have a maximum amount they will pay for any one item sold by the player.  Shopkeepers are sometimes replaced by other shopkeepers, especially if somebody buys out all of their stock.

Most shops have other functions as well.

General Store (1): Buys and sells food, cloaks, light sources, ammunition,  and other minor items.

Armoury (2): Buys and sells all sorts of armor and shields.  Will enchant armor for a price.

Weapon Smiths (3): Buys and sells all sorts of weapons and ammunition. Will enchant a weapon for a price.

Temple (4):  Buys and sells blunt weapons, potions, scrolls, and sometimes prayer books.  Will initiate a player with a spirit, or restore that player's skills, for a price.

Alchemy Shop (5):  Buys and sells potions and scrolls.  Will identify all inventory items for a price.

Magic Shop (6):  Buys and sells charms, wands, staves, amulets, and will buy potions and scrolls.  Will cast the ritual of Recall for a very high price.  This ritual will bring you back to the town at the moment of death, completely healed, without your items and with very little money.

Black Market (7):  Buys most things at low prices, sells most things at high.  They can get things that the other shops can't, and they charge for them.

Home (8):  A house a player may buy to rest at, and store things in.

Bookstore (9):  Buys and sells all sorts of magical books.  All bookstores have quiet study rooms to learn hermetic spells in.

Inn (white 'I'):  Has food available, and rooms to rent for the night (or for the day, for nocturnal folk).

Pawnbrokers (green 'P'): Will purchase items.

Town Hall (yellow 'H'):  Will show records of other players, and will sell you a house if one is available in town.


Towns
=====

Towns have dungeon areas known as sewers, and most have some sort of shop.  Some of them are unusually well-populated with one sort of creature or another, and some of them have guardians at the bottom of their sewers, which must be defeated.

Different towns have different collections of shops, and different depths to their sewers.

The Beautiful City of Celephais:  Lacks a black market, but has all other shops, including two temples.  The sewers go down to 150'.

The Picturesque Town of Ulthar:  Also lacks a black market.  The sewers go down to 350', and have the Champion of Cats as a guardian.

The Unwholesome City of Dyath-Leen:  Has no Temple, Alchemy Shop, or Magic Shop, but three black markets make it a great place to shop for players with lots of money.  The sewers go down to 450', and are populated as if they were 50' deeper than they are.

Kadath, Home of the Gods:  Well, the relatively mild gods of Earth, but they usually flee the approach of sufficiently strong mortals and call for the Outer Gods to protect them.  Kadath is actually a mountain, and has no shops.  It is crawling with Cthulhoid entities.  The dungeon goes down to 3750', act as if they were 2500' deeper, and are guarded by Nyarlathotep and Azathoth.  Wise adventurers avoid Kadath until they are tremendously strong.

Dungeons and Towers
======== === ======

These are in the wilderness, and are reached by walking from the towns. Dungeons can be full-sized, and down staircases go away from the surface and towards more dangerous levels.  Towers always have small levels, and up staircases go away from the surface and towards more dangerous levels. As a visual cue, the depth/height indicator in dungeons and sewers is in parentheses (e.g., "(50 ft.)"), whereas it is different in towers (e.g., "/50 ft.\").  All dungeons and towers have guardians.

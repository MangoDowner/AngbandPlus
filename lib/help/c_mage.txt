#####R=== Mages ===

#####GDescription
A Mage must live by his wits. He cannot hope to simply hack his way 
through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat, 
deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without an
assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. He can
master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, 
and has the best saving throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.
 
There is no reason a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are 
their true realm. 

#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (spellcasting stat)
Dexterity.

#####GMagic Usage
A mage can choose up to two realms of magic to master.

The [[[[[Bfirst realm] can be a choice of:
*****m_magery.txt*0[Magery], *****m_shadow.txt*0[Shadow], *****m_nether.txt*0[Nether] or *****m_magic.txt*0[Magic].

The [[[[[Bsecond realm] is determined by which realm you chose as your 
first realm of magic. 
- If you chose Magery or Nether, your second realm will be *****m_sigald.txt*0[Sigaldry]
- If you chose Shadow your second realm will be *****m_spirit.txt*0[Spirit].
- If you chose Magic, you will not have a second realm.

Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning spells. Even
then, they are still bound in certain ways. Mages can learn up to 64 
spells, thus having to choose which spells to learn.

#####GStarting Equipment
A mage begins the game with:
    L1 spellbooks of chosen realms
    A dagger
    A wand of fire bolts
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:
    A L2 spellbook of one of the chosen realms

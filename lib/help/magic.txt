=== STangband Magic System ===

In the official releases of Angband there are only two types magic
spells: Magic spells and priestly prayers. If the character is a mage,
ranger or a rogue (s)he can learn magic spells; if (s)he is a priest or
a paladin, (s)he can learn prayers. All mages can learn the same spells
and all priests can learn the same spells.

The magic system in STangband uses 10 realms of magic. 
There are 4 Arcane realms: Life, Death, Order and Chaos. 
	4 Elemental realms: Fire, Water, Earthand Air. 
	Plus 2 metamagic realms: Astral and Wizardry.

If you paly a spellcasting class you can select either one or two 
realms from those available. Note that certain realms may be prohibited
for some classes. Since a character can have (at most) two realms of 
magic, and the old spells have been split between the existing realms,
on the first glance it may seem that this system makes spell-users less
powerful. However, the opposite holds true. While a given realm of
magic typically includes spells of a certain type, new ultra powerful
rare high-level spells have been added to many realms.

As the spells have been separated into their different types, Magic 
should not be relied upon with this system if you are using one realm.
One realm only covers a few damage types. For example how do you kill 
a fire elemental when you only have Fire attack spells?

Any spell realm should have enough high-level spells even for the later
stages of the game. The main difference lies in how they support your
playing strategy: all offer "weapon" spells which let you directly
hurt your enemy, but spells for protection, healing and gathering 
information differ with each realm.

In standard Angband, there were 9 spellbooks for all spellcasters. In
STangband, there are 4 spellbooks per realm. Two of them 
can be bought in the town stores and the remaining two must be found 
in the dungeon (although they may occasionally appear in the Black 
Market or a rare book store). The exception to this rule is the Astral
realm since all  Astral spellbooks can be found in the magic shop or 
book store. Just  as one might expect, Astral magic lacks the really 
powerful high level spells.

A character with two realms of magic will thus need to carry a maximum
of 8 spellbooks while a character with only one realm of magic will
only need to carry a maximum of 4 spellbooks. All realms have 32
spells, and each book contains 8 spells.


***** <ClassSpellAbil>
=== Main Class Spell Ability ===
This covers your major D&D player types.

Warriors
     Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they even gain
     experience for destroying high level spellbooks.

Mages
     Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning spells.
     They can freely choose any realm when a character is created:
     in the current version, all ten realms are available to them,
     although their natural inclination makes Arcane magic fairly hard
     for them. Otherwise, a mage tends to learn and cast all the spells
     in his / her realms better than any other character.

Clerics
     Clerics can choose two realms just like Mages but they use prayer
     instead. They can learn Elemental magic even if not as efficiently 
     as mages. However, when learning spells, priests cannot voluntarily 
     decide which spells to study: they are rewarded with new prayers by 
     their patron deities, with no money-back satisfaction guarantee. 

Rogues
     A Rogue only gets Astral magic in STangband but they will discover	
     this gives them magic missile, resistance and detection spells.

Half Classes:
    There are a lot of half classes available and note that it is not 
    possible to combine Mage and Cleric.

Warrior
     Still gives no magic.

Rogue
     When in half class they do not give magic.

Mage
     Mage give one spell realm and makes the method casting.

Cleric
     Cleric gives one spell ream and makes the method prayer.


***** <MagicRealms>
=== The Realms of Magic ===

<<< Elemental Realms >>>
    The four elemental realms are Fire, Water, Earth and Air. They
    all have equal attack, defense and utility spells. Each realm
    contains a few sub-realms and will be almost useless for fighting
    the wrong elemental. Each realm starts with a resistance for its
    self and will get a resistance spell for its opposite later.

 ^^ Fire ^^
     The Fire realm covers Flame, Sun and Volcano magic with the common
     spellbooks being mostly Flame and the rare spellbooks being Sun
     and Volcano.
     Most of the Fire spells are destructive and has lots of powerful
     attack spells. A lot of the Utility spells are Energy based and can 
     recharge and improve weapons. Fire has almost no Defencive spells
     but they do not really need it.

 ~~ Water ~~
     The Water realm covers Water, Ice and Acid magic with the three
     mixed in all books. 
     Because of Water's wide choice getting around a resistance is 
     not usually a problem. Water has several Defencive and Healing
     spells. Most of the Utility spells are Detection.

 ** Earth **
     The Earth realm covers Earth, Gravity and Crystal magic. It has a
     lot of detection and enemy disruption. Earth has the best 
     defencive spells and some very powerful attack. Earth's main
     Utility is digging. Which is not available to others.

 () Air ()
     The Air realm covers Wind, Lightning and Sound magic. Air is 
     the best realm for speed and has lost of spells to avoid some 
     bad situations. It has lots of attack spells and not all can
     be resisted. Air is a bit low on defence but it does have lots
     of escape spells.

>>> Arcane Realms <<<
    The 4 Arcane realms are Life, Death, Order and Chaos. They
    vary greatly from the elemental realms as they have less attack
    spells and they work on different resistances. This is balanced
    by the defence and utility spells.

 ++ Life ++
     Life is magic is 'good' magic; it relies mostly on its excellent
     healing and protective spells. Its sub-realms are Holy and Nature.
     It does have a few attack spells as well, but these are mostly 
     used for harming and banishing foul minions of evil and will
     have litle effect on others. For that they will need to use the
     potent nature spells.

 \/ Death \/
     There is no fouler nor more evil category of spells than the
     necromantic black spells of Death Magic. These spells are relatively
     hard to learn, but at higher levels the spells give the caster
     power over living and the (un)dead. Poison, vampirism, death
     spells and even hellfire can be directed by the caster, but the
     most powerful spells need his / her own blood as the focus, often
     hurting the caster in the process of casting. Should a Death
     caster find the legendary tome Necronomicon, he can expect to gain
     very great powers indeed, but at a cost: few that have studied the
     accursed tome have retained their sanity.

 ## Order ##
     Order has a lot of spells that give or take a small amount.
     It has the best detection and identify spells. In the rare books, 
     there are spells with which you can enchant your items or turn 
     unwanted items to gold. However, Order has one weakness: it has only 
     five attack spells to deal direct damage to your enemies.
     But these spells are good at getting past resistance.

 && Chaos &&
     The Chaos realm is split into Logrus and Trump spells.
     Trump is very powerful but it has the potential to do anything.
     Sounds good? Maybe you did not want to Identify in front of that 
     Dragon? Do not be put off by the strangeness of these spells. 
     Having to recast the spell next turn is usually worth it since it
     really counts as multiple spells.
     Logrus is pure Chaos and is usually liquid. It is very destructive
     and is the most powerful and bizarre attack in the game.
     Chaos has a lot of Teleportation, Summoning and Polymorphing spells.

||| Meta Realms |||
    Meta realms are your basic D&D spells for people who love them.

 // Astral //
     Astral magic is a general purpose realm of magic. It is very basic
     and has Magic Missile for all you unimaginative people. This is the 
     downside of Astral magic: while Astral magic does have all the 
     necessary 'tool' spells for a dungeon delver, it has no ultra-powerful 
     high level spells. As a consequence, all Astral spellbooks can be 
     bought in town. It should also be noted that the 'specialized' realms 
     (i.e. other than Astral) usually offer the same spell at a lower level 
     and cost. Astral magic is therefore perhaps not recommendable as one's 
     only realm of magic (unless you don't get a choice), but it should be 
     a very nice addition to fill up the gaps in the selection of tools 
     spells in another realm.

 \\ Wizardry \\
     Here is a more powerful version of the Astral realm. It contains most 
     of your D&D spells and still has powerful, rare spellbooks. Do not think
     that because it is a Meta realm it is not powerful. It contains spells
     like Disintegrate and Magic Meteorite. It also has some powerful 
     defencive spells in it.

***** <CastingSpells>
=== On Casting Spells ... ===

Players who select spellcasting characters may notice a few unusual
phenomena during the course of the game. Here's a few helps and
hints on what may be happening.

--- Armor and Spell Casting ---

All spellcasting classes are penalized for wielding armor above a
certain total combined weight. The threshold varies between 30lbs
for a mage and 40lbs for a paladin. Typically, the more reliant on
spells/prayers your class is deemed to be, the lower your weight
allowance. If you exceed your weight limit, your mana will drop.
This penalty is fairly stiff for low level characters but can
generally be ignored by high level ones.

--- Mage-Types and Gloves ---

Spellcasters who use INT as the stat determining their spellcasting
ability will be penalized heavily for wielding armor on their
hands. The exception to this is that wielding gloves, gauntlets or
cesti which boost DEX or which grant Free Action will result in no
penalty. The rationale behind this is that the hands are needed to
perform intricate gestures that accompany the casting of the spell
and anything encumbering the hands would interfere with this. The
priest-type classes (priest, paladin and monk) do not have the same
restrictions as they are viewed as invoking the power of their
deity directly through prayer.

--- Casting Spells With Insufficient Mana ---

Occasionally, you may try (either by accident or in desperation) to
cast a spell when you have insufficient mana to do so. In these
circumstances you will be told by the game that you do not have
enough mana to cast the spell and then asked if you want to anyway.
Casting the spell under these conditions has a drastically reduced
chance of success and may also result in your constitution being
damaged. It may also cause you to faint from the effort which will
effectively paralyze you for several turns (even with free action).
The CON drain and the paralyzation may happen regardless of whether
the casting was successful or not.

--- Spell Durations ---

Some spells such as Haste-Self or Resistance grant an effect which
wears off after a certain period of time. With very few exceptions,
multiple castings of such spells are not cumulative in terms of the
duration of the spell. In other words, casting a spell which has a
duration of 20 turns three times will not result in a duration of
60 turns. Typically, the subsequent castings will add only a small
amount to the total duration.

***** <SpellTypes>
=== Spell Types ===

--- Bolts and Beams ---

A bolt spell is aimed in a direction or at a target but will hit
the first monster or obstruction in its targeted direction. This
may or may not be the intended target. Occasionally, you may note
that your bolt spell hits multiple targets along the line of fire.
This is because some bolt spells are granted a chance of 'beaming'
which may be either fixed or level-dependent. A beam will hit every
target within range along a 'straight' line in the direction in
which it was aimed.

--- Balls ---

There are two things to remember about ball spells. Firstly, unlike
bolt spells, they can be aimed at a specific target which allows
you to target a specific monster as opposed to the first one in the
direction you are aiming. Secondly, they have a radius (which
varies from spell to spell). A radius value of one or more will
result in the spell affecting monsters (and possibly objects, etc)
around the target in addition to the target itself. Lots of ball
spells are targeting the player hitting all around you.

--- Wave ---

This is the same shape as a monster breath and works like a ball.

--- Line-of-Sight ---

Line-of-sight spells affect all monsters that that are currently
in sight of your character. This includes monsters that may not
currently be visible due to darkness but would be if it was light.

--- Area ---

Area spells affect an area around the player. The size of the area
can vary considerably. For example, Light Area lights a single room
while Detect Traps affects a map panel and Genocide the entire
level.

***** <Hints>
=== Hints and Tips ===

If you miss the `old` magic user, try picking Astral and Wizardy magic
to get the most commonly used mage spells early on (Magic Missile,
Detect Monsters + Traps + etc, Identify).

It is generally a good idea to pick one defensive realm and one 
offensive realm. For example try using life or order with chaos or
death magic. Elementals are somewhat neutral: it has both offensive and
defensive spells.

If you pick the realms always in the same order (e.g. fire as your
first realm and life as your second realm, not the other way around)
you will be less confused when trying to pick the correct spellbook to
use in the game. If you still get confused trying to select the correct
spellbook, try using macros (either the 'full' macros or inscriptions).

If you are unsure about what a spell does, use the browse command to
examine a spell. This will give you a longer description and you can
use this before you can cast the spell. You can examine any spell that
has a level of at least one above yours.

#####R === PernAngband Magic System ===

In the official releases of Angband there are only two types magic
spells:  Magic spells and priestly Prayers.  If the character is a
mage, ranger or a rogue  (s)he can learn magic spells; if (s)he is
a priest  or  a paladin,  (s)he  can learn prayers.  All mages can 
learn the same spells and all priests can learn the same spells.

PernAngband uses a more complex  "realms of magic" system improved 
(or so we hope)  from ZAngband, which in turn was inspired  by the 
commercial  fantasy  strategy game  Master of Magic  (Microprose), 
which in turn supposedly borrowed it from the card game _Magic the 
Gathering_ (by Wizards of the Coast).  The magic system,  as it is 
implemented  in  PernAngband,  consists of  four major realms  and 
eight minor realms.  The major realms are Nether, Valarin, Shadow, 
and Magery. It may be convenient to think of the realms as being a 
wheel:  Nether stands opposite  of Valarin,  and Shadow of Magery. 
Between Nether and  Shadow lies  the subtle Illusion realm,  while 
the gap between Nether and Magery is bridged by the wizards' realm 
of Sigaldry.  The Crusade  realm lies  between Valarin and Magery, 
and the  harnessing  of  natural  energies of the  Tribal realm is 
between Shadow and Valarin. Aside from these, there are the realms 
of special magic,  utilized by select  classes such as  Harpers or 
Mimics.

=====================================

In standard Angband,  the type of a  character's spell ability was 
determined  solely by the  character class.  In PernAngband,  most 
spellcasting classes can select one  (or even two) types from the 
realms of magic available. 

The system of magic in  PernAngband is similar to that of standard 
Angband,  but with subtle,  underlying differences  that do make a 
significant difference.  Spellcasters choose their realms, but are 
allowed only a set allotment of them.

In standard Angband, there were 9 spellbooks for all spellcasters. 
In PernAngband,  there are 9 each  for the major realms and 4 each 
for the minor realms.  The first four  books of  a major realm and 
the first  two books  of a minor  realm  can be bought  in a store 
(Valarin and Crusade  spellbooks in the  town temple,  the rest in 
the bookshop; of course the Black Market may stock any spellbook.)
A character  with one major realm  and one minor realm  might thus 
be carrying a whopping 13 spellbooks,  while a character with only 
one  half-realm  of  magic  (rogues, rangers, paladins, and monks) 
will  only need  to carry four  at the maximum.  All major  realms 
have  64 spells,  dispersed  throughout  the books,  and all minor 
realms have 32 spells, 8 in each book.

It is important to note that the more spells studied in one realm, 
the more effective spells from  that realm will be for the caster.
This represents  the relative proficiency of  a  spellcaster  who 
specializes in one realm.


#####R=== Notes on Summoned / Charmed Creatures ===

A friendly creature can be a mixed blessing. At first sight,
one might  think that  they can  make the game  much easier.
It is of course highly satisfying to send your pet Hell Wyrm
into  a Troll pit and wait outside,  listening for the howls
of agony and terror,  the sounds of  guts splattering, bones
crunching and so on.  But one should not expect  to gain any
experience for such a combat:  you will only gain experience
for creatures  to whom you  deliver the death blow yourself.
New experiences require hazards,  nobody gains experience by
sitting home watching the TV.

Secondly,  friendly monsters  are often so eager  to destroy
your opponents  they may  forget all about you,  and you get
trampled under their feet as they charge at  your foe.  They
are not  as smart as  the regular monsters,  since they have
given  up their free will to serve you.  So don't stand next
to that Snaga when your pet Cyberdemon brandishes its rocket
launcher!  Pets are also  rather easily irritable.  Once you
do something  which causes the slightest discomfort to them,
they will revert  to their normal behaviour and consider you
their main target.  This is something to think about  before
lighting up a room  if you have  pet orcs.  Needless to say,
nobody wants to be your friend if you are aggravating them.
Finally,  it takes  a lot of  mental energy  to maintain the
control over the charmed monsters.  The first monster or the
first few are 'free', but after that maintaining the control
will start taxing your mana regain rate.  The higher the sum
of the levels of your pets the less mana you will be able to
regain. Keep this in mind if you have a pet which can summon
or otherwise produce more pets...

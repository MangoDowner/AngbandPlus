=== Hengband Magic System ===


The magic system of Hengband is a modified version of Zangband's, with many
new features added.  There are two kind of magic in Hengband:  Spellbook
magic, similar to the normal magic system of Zangband, and class-specific
magic, similar to Zangband's mindcrafting.

There are nine different realms of spellbook magic; Life, Sorcery,
Nature, Chaos, Death, Trump, Arcane, Craft, and Daemon.  Players of
each class can study and cast spells from spellbooks using one stat;
intelligence, wisdom, or charisma. For spellcasting, you must always
carry spellbooks which include spells which you want to cast.  You can
choose either one or two realms, depending on class. In Hengband, you can
change your second realm in the middle of the game (Simply study ('G') from 
a spellbook of the new magic realm).

There are eleven classes which use class specific magic (or techniques);
Mindcraft (Mindcrafter), 
Imitation (Imitator), 
Device-Eating-Magic (Magic-Eater), 
Music (Bard), 
Kendo (Samurai), 
The Force (ForceTrainer), 
Blue-Magic (Blue Mage), 
Rage (Berserker),
Smithery (Weaponsmith), 
Mirror-magic (Mirror Master), and 
Ninjutsu (Ninja)


In addition to the above, each class has one or two special techniques
called Class Powers, which may be used by typing ("U", or "O" in the 
roguelike keyset).  Class powers are different from magic, but are explained 
in this text together with magic.

You might not be able to understand the function of every magic spell
by reading its name or casting it a few times. In Hengband, spells have 
descriptions.  Use the browse command ("b"/"P") and choose a spell from 
the list to see its description.

=== Class Spell Ability ===

Warrior
     Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they even gain
     experience for destroying high level spellbooks.  They have a
     class power - 'Sword Dancing' - which allows them to conduct a melee
     attack in six random directions.

Mage
     Mages have the least restrictions in choosing and learning
     spells.  They can freely choose any two realms when a character
     is created:  in the current version, all seven realms are
     available, although their natural inclination makes Life
     magic fairly hard to learn. Otherwise, a mage tends to learn and
     cast all the spells in his or her realms better than any other
     character.  The ability to choose second realm of magic has a
     special meaning in Hengband; only second realm can be changed in
     the middle of the game. You can change second realm by studying
     ("G") from a spellbook of new realm.  They have a class power
     - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.
     Intelligence determines their spellcasting ability.


Priest
     Priest can select from Life, Death, or Daemon as a first realm, and
     choose second realm almost freely. But two kinds of pair selection
      - Life/Death and Life/Daemon - are not allowed.  Priests can learn
     all spells in the selected realms, even if not as efficiently as
     mages. However, when learning spells, priests cannot voluntarily
     decide which spells to study: they are rewarded with new prayers
     by their patron deities, with no money-back satisfaction
     guarantee. Priests which select the Life realm have a class power
     - 'Bless Weapon' - which blesses any edged weapon to be suitable
     for priests to wield.  Every priest which select Death or Daemon
     realms have a class power - 'Evocation' - which damages, scares and
     banish all monsters in sight.
     Wisdom determines a priest's success at praying to his or her deity.

Rogue
     Rogues can select one realm from Sorcery, Death, Trump, Arcane, or
     Craft.  All Rogues have certain limitations on which spells they
     can learn, and they do not learn new spells very quickly. Rogues
     are very good at both melee and shooting and, for them, magic is
     secondary.  They have a class power - 'Hit and Away' - which allows
     them to attack in melee and teleport away from there at once.
     Intelligence determines a Rogue's spellcasting ability.

Ranger
     All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all Nature spells
     are available to them. They even learn these spells almost as
     fast as mages. They can also select a secondary realm (from
     Sorcery, Chaos, Death, Trump, Arcane, and Daemon), but they are
     slow learners here, and may find themselves unable to learn
     some of the highest level spells.  They have a class power -
     'Probe Monster' - which allows them to know a monster's HP,
     speed, and experience required to evolve.
     Intelligence determines a Ranger's spellcasting ability.

Paladin
     Paladins can select a realm from Life and Death.  Like priests,
     they cannot select which prayers to learn, but are rewarded with
     new prayers by their deities. They can learn all spells, but not
     as fast as priests. They detest paganism so strongly that they
     will even gain experience for destroying high-level pagan spell-
     books: 'pagan' means Life spellbooks for a Death Paladin and
     all spellbooks other than Life for a Life Paladin.  Depending on 
     their realm, they have a class power - 'Holy Lance' or 'Hell Lance'.  
     Wisdom determines a Paladin's success at praying to his or her deity.

Warrior-Mage
     Warrior-mages begin the game with Arcane magic, and they can
     freely select another realm of magic. Although they do not gain
     new spells as fast as regular mages, they will eventually learn
     every spell in both realms, thus making them a very competitive
     choice for players who appreciate Arcane magic.  They have two class
     powers - 'Convert HP to SP' and 'Convert SP to HP' -  which allow
     them to heal HP using mana or gain mana using HP.  Intelligence
     determines a Warrior-Mage's spellcasting ability.

Chaos-Warrior
     Chaos Warriors can select a realm from Chaos and Daemon.  They
     are not interested in any other form of magic. They can learn
     every spell.  They have a class power - 'Confusing Light' - which
     stuns, confuses, and scares all monsters in sight.  
     Intelligence determines a Chaos-Warrior's spellcasting ability.

Monk
     The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of
     magic. They select a realm from Life, Nature, Craft, and Death.
     They will eventually learn all prayers in the discipline of their
     choice.  They have two class powers - 'Assume a Posture' and
     'Double Attack'. They can choose different forms of postures in
     different situations, and use powerful combinations of attacks 
     for the finishing blow.
     Wisdom determines a Monk's spellcasting ability.

Mindcrafter
     Although the powers of a Mindcrafter may seem like magic, this is
     not -- strictly speaking -- the case. They are mental powers,
     independent of the ordinary sources of magic. Consequently,
     Mindcrafters are not interested in spellbooks. They gain new mind-
     crafting powers and their existing ones become stronger as they
     gain levels. They can use their power even when blinded.  They
     have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which allows them to rapidly
     regenerate their mana.  
     Wisdom determines a Mindcrafter's ability to use his or her powers.

High-Mage
     High-mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of
     magic and learn it very well -- much better than the ordinary
     mage. For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, they
     gain substantial benefits in the mana costs, minimum levels, and
     failure rates of the spells in their speciality realm. They
     have a class power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands,
     staves, or rods.
     Intelligence determines a High-Mage's spellcasting ability.

Tourist
     Tourists are always seeing more of the world to add to their stock 
     of information; no other class can compete with their identification 
     skills.  They have two class powers - 'Take a Photograph' and 
     'Identify True'.  Their magic is based on Arcane, and - aside from 
     identify - is very weak indeed.
     Intelligence determines a Tourist's spellcasting ability.

Imitator
     Imitators use a unique technique - 'Imitation' - which imitates
     monster spells/techniques include whose damage/duration value.
     When monsters in view use spells, they are added to a temporary
     spell list which the imitator can choose among. Spells should
     be imitated quickly, because timing and situation are everything.
     An imitator can only repeat a spell once each time he observes
     it. They only have a small long-term memory for spells, which
     ranges from one to three, depending on their level.  When they
     memorize more spells than this, they will forget the oldest
     spell in the list.  They have a class power - 'Double Revenge' -
     which allows them to imitate spells at double damage or duration.
     Dexterity determines an Imitator's general imitation ability, but 
     a stat related to the specific action is often also taken into 
     account.

BeastMaster
     Beastmasters use Trump magic to make good use of their monster
     domination and riding abilities.  They are very good at summoning
     living creatures, and they learn summoning spells quicker than
     Mages. However, they cannot summon non-living creatures.  They 
     have two class powers - 'Dominate a Living Thing' and 'Dominate 
     Living Things'.  
     Charisma determines a Beastmaster's spellcasting ability.

Sorcerer
     Sorcerers are the all-around best magicians, being able to cast
     any spell from most magic realms without having to learn it. On
     the downside, they are the worst fighters in the dungeon, being
     unable to use any weapon but a Wizardstaff.  They have a class
     power - 'Eat Magic' - which absorbs mana from wands, staves or rods.
     Intelligence determines a Sorcerer's spellcasting ability.

Archer
     Archers are to archery what a warrior is to melee.  They learn no 
     spells.  Archers have a class power - 'Create Ammo' - which creates 
     stones or shots from pile of rubble, and arrows and crossbow bolts 
     from bones.

Magic-Eater
     Magic-Eaters can absorb the energy of wands, staffs, and rods, and
     can then use these magics as if they were carrying all of these
     absorbed devices. Mana and changes of absorbed devices are
     regenerated naturally by a Magic-Eater's power, and speed of
     regeneration is influenced by their intelligence.  They have a
     class power - 'Absorb Magic' - which is used to absorb magic devices.
     A Magic-Eater's prime statistic is intelligence.

Bard
     Bards use music rather than magic.  Songs are found in four songbooks, 
     of which two are sold in town.  There is a special feature of music; 
     many songs continue to be sung until either the Bard chooses to stop, 
     or he runs out of the energy required to sing that type of song.  
     Bards have a class power - 'Stop Singing'.  
     Charisma determines a Bard's singing ability.

Red-Mage
     Red Mages are similar to Warrior-Mage; they are decent fighters and
     spellcasters.  Red-Mages can use almost all spells from lower rank
     spellbooks of all realms:  first and second spellbooks of all
     realms and third and fourth Arcane spellbooks, without having to
     learn it, but they cannot cast spells from higher rank spellbooks;
     third and fourth spellbooks for all realms other than Arcane.
     Since they use all realms at once, they are extremely slow learners 
     in them, and spells cost more mana to cast.  They have a class power
     - 'Double Magic' - which allows them to cast two spells at once.  
     Intelligence determines a Red-Mage's spellcasting ability.

Samurai
     Samurai use the art of the blade called Kendo (or Bugei).  Books
     of Kendo are similar to spellbooks, but Samurai don't need to carry
     them around; the books are needed only when they study new combat
     techniques. Samurai need a weapon wielded to use the techniques of
     Kendo, and most techniques will add powerful special properties to
     their blows; such as flaming, poisoning, vampiric, etc...  Their 
     maximum spellpoints don't depend on their level but solely on 
     wisdom, and they can use the class power 'Concentration' to tempo-
     rarily increase SP beyond its usual maximum value.  They have one 
     more class power - 'Assume a Posture'.  They can choose different 
     forms of posture in different situations.  
     Wisdom determines a Samurai's ability to use the special combat 
     techniques available to him.

ForceTrainer
     ForceTrainer use both spellbook magic and the special spiritual
     power called the Force. They can select a realm from Life, Nature,
     Craft, and Death, just like Monks. To use The Force, you select
     it just as if it were spellbook 'w'; which means you need to
     press 'm' and then 'w' to select the Force.  The most important
     spell of the Force is 'Improve Force'; each time a ForceTrainer
     activates it, their Force power becomes more powerful, and
     their attack power in bare-handed melee fighting is increased
     temporarily. The strengthened Force can be released at one stroke
     when a ForceTrainer activates some other Force spell, typically
     an attack spell. They prefer fighting with neither weapon nor
     armor, and wielding weapons or wearing heavy armor disturbs use
     of the Force.  They have a class power - 'Clear Mind' - which
     allows them to rapidly regenerate their mana.
     Wisdom is a ForceTrainer's primary stat.

Blue-Mage
     A Blue-Mage can learn and cast monster spells/techniques as
     their own spell; this technique is called Blue magic. Unlike
     Imitators, Blue-Mages remember their spells permanently, but they
     must learn spells from monsters by activating their class power
     'Learning', and they can learn only attack and summoning spells.
     Intelligence determines a Blue-Mage's spellcasting ability.

Cavalry
     Like Warriors and Archers, the cavalry don't use magic.  Since 
     they are very good at riding, they have a class power - 'Rodeo' - 
     which allows them to forcibly saddle and tame wild monsters.

Berserker
     Berserkers use a unique system of techniques called 'Rage'. They 
     gain more techniques as they gain levels. They use no magic: 
     indeed, they cannot use any magic devices or activate any artifacts,
     and cannot read scrolls. To offset these great disadvantages, 
     Berserkers are allowed to have two important class powers - 
     'Satisfy Hunger' and 'Recall'.

Weaponsmith
     A Weaponsmith can improve weapons and armors. They extract the essen-
     ces of special effects from weapons or armors which have various 
     special abilities, and can add these essences to another weapon or 
     armor. Normally, each equipment can be improved only once, but they 
     can remove a previously added essence from improved equipment to 
     improve it with another essence. To-hit, to-damage bonus, and AC can
     be improved freely up to a maximum value depending on level.
     Weaponsmiths have a class power - 'Judgment' - which allows them to 
     identify (later *identify*) weapons and armor.

Mirror-Master
     Mirror-Masters can create magical mirrors, and employ them in the
     casting of Mirror-Magic spells. They gain more spells and each
     spell becomes more powerful as they gain levels. They can use
     their spells even when blinded.  For Mirror-Masters, the arrange-
     ment of mirrors is very important:  Some attack spells reflect from
     mirrors, and some other spells are effective only against monsters
     standing on a mirror.  A Mirror-Master standing on a mirror has
     greater ability and, for example, can perform quick teleports.
     The maximum number of magical Mirrors which can be controlled
     simultaneously depends on the level, and breaking unnecessary
     mirrors is important work for them.  They have two class powers
     - 'Break Mirrors', which breaks all mirrors in current dungeon level
     and 'Mirror Concentration', which allows them to rapidly regenerate
     their mana on a mirror.
     Intelligence determines a Mirror-Master's spellcasting ability.

Ninja
     A Ninja can use Ninjutsu for lurking and surprise attacks.
     They gain more Ninjutsu techniques as they gain levels.  They
     have a class power - 'Quick Walk' - which makes their walking
     speed very fast.
     Dexterity determines a Ninja's ability to use Ninjutsu.



***** <MagicRealms>
=== The Realms of Magic ===

Life
     Life magic is 'good' magic; it relies mostly on healing and
     protective spells. It does have a few attack spells as well, but
     these are mostly used for harming and banishing foul minions of
     evil, especially undead monsters.  The fail rate of Life spells 
     goes up if the caster's alignment tends towards evil.

Sorcery
     Sorcery is a `meta` realm, including enchantment and general
     spells. It provides superb protection spells (such as Teleport
     spells for fleeing and even Globe of Invulnerability), spells to
     enhance your odds in combat (Slow Monster, Haste Self, Confuse
     Monster) and, most importantly, a vast selection of spells for
     gathering information: in addition to the usual detection and
     identify spells, one of the standard spellbooks has a spell called
     Identify True, which gives you full knowledge of a given object!
     In the rare books, there are spells with which you can enchant
     your items or turn unwanted items to gold. However, Sorcery has
     one weakness: it has no spells to deal direct damage to your
     enemies.

Nature
     Nature magic makes you a master of the elements; it provides
     protection, detection, curing and attack spells, and most
     importantly, spells that change surrounding geographical features.
     Nature also has offers Herbal Healing, which is the only
     powerful healing spell outside the realm of Life magic.  Fail
     rate of Nature spells goes up when the caster's alignment becomes 
     very good or evil.

Chaos
     Chaos is the very element of unmaking, and Chaos spells are
     the most terrible weapons of destruction imaginable. From Magic
     Missile and Acid Bolt to the medium level Fire Ball and Doom
     Bolt, and finally to the awesome spells of Invoke Logrus, Mana
     Storm and Call the Void, Chaos offers an unsurpassable arsenal of
     attack spells. Chaos is the only realm which provides the
     *Destruction* spell. The caster can also call on the primal
     forces of Chaos to induce mutations in his/her opponents and even
     him/herself, but otherwise, Chaos has no protective spells.
     Beware!  Chaos spells are known to backfire easily and produce
     undesired effects.

Death
     There is no fouler nor more evil category of spells than the
     necromantic spells of Death Magic. These spells are relatively
     hard to learn, but at higher levels the spells give the caster
     power over living and the (un)dead. Poison, vampirism, death
     spells, and even hellfire can be directed by the caster, but the
     most powerful spells need his/her own blood as the focus, often
     hurting the caster in the process of casting. Should a Death
     wizard find the legendary tome Necronomicon, he can expect to
     gain very great powers indeed, but at a cost: few that have
     studied that accursed tome have retained their sanity.  The Fail 
     rate of Death spells goes up for casters aligned to good.

Trump
     Trump magic seems an independent source of power, although its
     supposed association with Chaos magic has been mentioned in
     several places. Although it lacks the unpredictable chaotic
     side-effects of Chaos magic, it has a few spells whose exact
     effects seem more or less random. One such spell is Shuffle: the
     Trump spellbooks actually consist of decks of trumps, and the
     Shuffle spell allows the caster to shuffle the deck and pick one
     card at random. The effect depends on the card picked, and is not
     always pleasant. In the Amber universe, the Trump gateways are
     also a major method of transportation: Trump magic has an
     admirable selection of teleportation spells. Since the Trump
     gateways can also be used to summon other creatures, Trump magic
     has an equally impressive selection of summoning spells. However,
     not all monsters appreciate being drawn to another place by a Trump
     user. The only summoned creatures whose loyalty is guaranteed are
     the Phantasmal Servants, who lack a will of their own (but can
     develop one, if you treat them badly).

Arcane
     Even more than Sorcery, Arcane magic is a general purpose realm of
     magic. It attempts to encompass all 'useful' spells from all 
     realms, and almost succeeds, with the probable exception of
     *Identify*. This is the downside of Arcane magic: while Arcane 
     does have all the necessary 'tool' spells for a dungeon delver, it
     has no ultra-powerful high level spells. As a consequence, all
     Arcane spellbooks can be bought in town. It should also be noted
     that the 'specialized' realms (i.e. other than Arcane) usually
     offer the same spell at a lower level and cost. Arcane magic is
     therefore not usually recommended as one's only realm of magic,
     but it should be a very nice addition to fill up the gaps in the
     selection of utility spells in another realm.

Craft
     Craft magic is an original realm in Hengband. It provides spells
     which reinforce the casters physical abilities, including offensive
     power, defensive power, speed, regeneration, infravision, etc..
     The 'Regeneration' and 'Walk through Wall' spells are especially
     powerful for their spell levels.  Craft magic doesn't provide
     detection spells, but does offer a temporary telepathy spell.

Daemon
     Daemon magic is an original realm in Hengband. It offers powerful
     attack spells with the properties of Fire or Nether. There are a
     few detection spells which provide a map of the nearby area or 
     temporary telepathy.  Daemon magic also provides temporary trans-
     formation spells which allow caster to become a Demon or a Demon 
     Lord.  The fail rate of Daemon spells goes up for casters aligned 
     towards good.



***** <CastingSpells>
=== On Casting Spells ... ===

Players who select spellcasting characters may notice a few unusual
phenomena during the course of the game. Here are a few hints and
hints on what may be happening.

--- Armor and Spell Casting ---

All spellcasting classes are penalized for wielding armor above a
certain total combined weight. The threshold varies between 30lbs
for a mage and 40lbs for a paladin. Typically, the more reliant on
spells/prayers your class is deemed to be, the lower your weight
allowance. If you exceed your weight limit, your mana will drop.
This penalty is fairly stiff for low level characters but can
generally be ignored by high level ones.

--- Mage-Types and Gloves ---

Spellcasters who cast spells from spellbooks using INT as the stat
determining their spellcasting ability, or Blue-Mages, will be penalized
heavily for wielding armor on their hands.  The exception to this is
that wielding gloves, gauntlets or cesti which boost DEX or which
grant Free Action will result in no penalty. The rationale behind this
is that the hands are needed to perform intricate gestures that
accompany the casting of the spell and anything encumbering the hands
would interfere with this. The priest-type classes (priest, paladin
and monk) do not have the same restrictions as they are viewed as
invoking the power of their deity directly through prayer.

--- Casting Spells With Insufficient Mana ---

Occasionally, you may try (either by accident or in desperation) to
cast a spell when you have insufficient mana to do so. In these
circumstances you will be told by the game that you do not have
enough mana to cast the spell and then asked if you want to anyway.
Casting the spell under these conditions has a drastically reduced
chance of success and may also result in your constitution being
damaged. It may also cause you to faint from the effort which will
effectively paralyze you for several turns (even with free action).
The CON drain and the paralyzation may happen regardless of whether
the casting was successful or not.

--- Spell Durations ---

Some spells such as Haste-Self or Resistance grant an effect which
wears off after a certain period of time. With very few exceptions,
multiple castings of such spells are not cumulative in terms of the
duration of the spell. In other words, casting a spell which has a
duration of 20 turns three times will not result in a duration of 60
turns. Typically, subsequent castings will add only a small amount
to the total duration. 

***** <SpellTypes>
=== Spell Types ===

--- Bolts and Beams ---

A bolt spell is aimed in a direction or at a target but will hit the
first monster or obstruction in its targeted direction. This may or
may not be the intended target. Occasionally, you may note that your
bolt spell hits multiple targets along the line of fire.  This is
because some bolt spells are granted a chance of 'beaming' which may
be either fixed or level-dependent. A beam will hit every target
within range along a 'straight' line in the direction in which it was
aimed.

--- Balls ---

There are two things to remember about ball spells. Firstly, unlike
bolt spells, they can be aimed at a specific target which allows you
to target a specific monster as opposed to the first one in the
direction you are aiming. Secondly, they have a radius (which varies
from spell to spell). A radius value of one or more will result in the
spell affecting monsters (and possibly objects, etc) around the target
in addition to the target itself. When ball spells are directed at 
monsters in walls, the ball will blow up at the front of the wall, and 
the monster will take only half damage.

--- Line-of-Sight ---

Line-of-sight spells affect all monsters that that are currently in
sight of your character. This includes monsters that may not currently
be visible due to darkness but would be if it was light.

--- Area ---

Area spells affect an area around the player. The size of the area can
vary considerably. For example, Light Area lights a single room while
Detect Traps and Mass Genocide affects within a circle of a specific
radius and normal Genocide affects the entire level.



***** <Hints>
=== Hints and Tips ===

If you miss the `old` magic user, try picking Sorcery and Chaos magic
to get the most commonly used mage spells early on (Magic Missile,
Detect Monsters + Traps + etc, Identify).

It is generally a good idea to pick one defensive realm and one
offensive realm. For example try using life or sorcery with chaos or
death magic. Nature is somewhat neutral: it has both offensive and
defensive spells, but is not very generous with either, not at least
early in the game. Nature should work best with characters who can use
other means to survive until they get the more powerful high level
spells.

If you pick the realms always in the same order (e.g. nature as your
first realm and chaos as your second realm, not the other way around)
you will be less confused when trying to pick the correct spellbook to
use in the game. If you still get confused trying to select the
correct spellbook, try using macros (either the 'full' macros or
inscriptions).

=== Introduction to the PernAngband (4.x.x) Magic System ===

In the official releases of Angband there are only two types magic
spells:  Magic spells and priestly prayers.  If the character is a
mage, ranger or a rogue  (s)he can learn magic spells; if (s)he is
a priest  or  a paladin,  (s)he  can learn prayers.  All mages can 
learn the same spells and all priests can learn the same spells.

PernAngband uses a more complex  "realms of magic" system improved 
(or so we hope)  from ZAngband, which in turn was inspired  by the 
commercial  fantasy  strategy game  Master of Magic  (Microprose), 
which in turn supposedly borrowed it from the card game _Magic the 
Gathering_ (by Wizards of the Coast).  The magic system,  as it is 
implemented  in  PernAngband,  consists of  four major realms  and 
eight minor realms.  The major realms are Nether, Valarin, Shadow, 
and Magery. It may be convenient to think of the realms as being a 
wheel:  Nether stands opposite  of Valarin,  and Shadow of Magery. 
Between Nether and  Shadow lies  the subtle Illusion realm,  while 
the gap between Nether and Magery is bridged by the wizards' realm 
of Sigaldry.  The Crusade  realm lies  between Valarin and Magery, 
and the  harnessing  of  natural  energies of the  Tribal realm is 
between Shadow and Valarin. Aside from these, there are the realms 
of special magic,  utilized by select  classes such as  Harpers or 
Mimics.

In standard Angband,  the type of a  character's spell ability was 
determined  solely by the  character class.  In PernAngband,  most 
spellcasting classes can select one  (or even two) types from the 
realms of magic available. (See later for available realms/class.)

The system of magic in  PernAngband is similar to that of standard 
Angband,  but with subtle,  underlying differences  that do make a 
significant difference.  Spellcasters choose their realms, but are 
allowed only a set allotment of them.

In standard Angband, there were 9 spellbooks for all spellcasters. 
In PernAngband,  there are 9 each  for the major realms and 4 each 
for the minor realms.  The first four  books of  a major realm and 
the first  two books  of a minor  realm  can be bought  in a store 
(Valarin and Crusade  spellbooks in the  town temple,  the rest in 
the bookshop; of course the Black Market may stock any spellbook.)
A character  with one major realm  and one minor realm  might thus 
be carrying a whopping 13 spellbooks,  while a character with only 
one  half-realm  of  magic  (rogues, rangers, paladins, and monks) 
will  only need  to carry four  at the maximum.  All major  realms 
have  64 spells,  dispersed  throughout  the books,  and all minor 
realms have 32 spells, 8 in each book.

It is important to note that the more spells studied in one realm, 
the more effective spells from  that realm will be for the caster.
This represents  the relative proficiency of  a  spellcaster  who 
specializes in one realm.

=== Character Classes and Spell Ability  ===

WARRIORS: Warriors cast no spells. They hate magic. In fact, they
even gain experience for destroying high level spellbooks.

MAGES: Mages have the least restrictions  in choosing and learning
spells. Even then, they are still bound in certain ways. All eight 
realms are available to them, but the realms cannot be chosen upon 
a  whim.  Mages can learn  up to 64  spells thus  having to choose
which spells tp learn.

PRIESTS: Priests choose  one or two  related disciplines.  If they 
opt for a major realm, they may take any except Magery.  For minor 
realms, they may choose from the realms Illusion, Tribal, Crusade, 
and Tribal.  Priests can learn up to 64 spells.  However,  they do 
not choose which spells they learn,  but the spells are granted to 
them by greater powers (without a money-back guarantee).

ROGUES: Rogues are not expert spellcrafters,  but may nevertheless 
learn some minor magicks. They may choose any realm except Valarin 
but  can  only  use the  first four  books. Rogues  can  learn  24
spells.

RANGERS: At one with the wilderness,  rangers may choose among the 
realms of Valarin, Illusion, and Tribal.  They have no limitations 
as to which books they  are allowed to use,  but can learn only up 
to 32 spells no matter they realm choice.

PALADINS: Paladins are holy warriors,  and as such they may choose 
one devotion from among Nether,  Valarin, and Crusade.  The Nether 
Paladin is one of sinister aspect, wielding power over the undead. 
His counterpart,  the Valarin Paladin,  focuses on  harnessing the 
powers of good to aid him.  The Crusade Paladin  is a more warlike 
fighter, using his spells to enhance his skill in battle. Paladins 
may learn up to 32 spells.

WARLOCKS: Warmages begin the game with Sigaldry, and they can 
freely select any other minor realm of magic.  They can eventually 
learn 48 spells.

CHAOS WARRIORS: Chaos Warriors are, as one might expect,trained in 
Chaos magic.  They are not interested in  any other form of magic. 
They can learn every Chaos spell.

MONKS: The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas 
of magic.  The typical monk utilizes his internal powers, and uses 
the Tribal realm.  A monk who serves the greater powers can choose 
the Valarin realm,  while monks who  deal with the  phantasmal can 
take the realms of Shadow or Illusion.  Nativist  monks could take 
the Tribal realm.  Monks who take one of the major realms can only 
learn from the first four books.  Monks can learn up to 24 spells.

MINDCRAFTER: Although the powers of a Mindcrafter may seem like
magic, this is not -- strictly speaking --  the case.  They are
mental powers,  independent of  the ordinary sources  of magic.
Consequently,  Mindcrafters are not  interested in 'magic'  and
learn no spells.

HIGH MAGES: High  mages can learn  only 48  spells  but they learn
them better than the normal mages. They can chose a Major realm or
two Minor realms.

BEASTMASTER: They use no realms of  magic. Instead they  have  a
powerfull summoning ability that allow them to call for help some
pets and to gain experience from their kills.

WIZARD: This is the old mage from Angband. They don't use realms
of magic. They have their own realm and 9 books.

PRIOR: This is the old priest from Angband. They don't use realms
of magic. They have their own realm and 9 books.

SORCERER: The Sorcerer can't fight with a weapon unless it's a Mage Staff.
But they can use every spell of every magic realm(that mean they can't use
the harper's books for exemple since those are songs).

ALCHEMIST:
     Alchemists are extremely proficient with all kinds of magical
devices, and have made a fine art of extracting, storing, and using
these objects' magical energies.  Because they neither fight well nor
cast powerful spells, alchemists rely on their craftsmenship to cope
with the dangers of the dungeons.  They will quickly learn to create
damage-dealing wands, rods, and staffs, forge powerful weapons and
armour, make highly useful objects of other kinds, and eventually will
understand the perilous art of artifact creation itself.

     The alchemaic techniques are accessed using the 'm' key.  An
alchemist may then 'E'xtract power, 'A'dd power, or (when sufficiently
experienced) 'C'reate an artifact.

     Many (but not all) potions, scrolls, wands, staffs, rods, rings,
and amulets contain useable magical energies.  An alchemist taps that
energy, using the technique "'E'xtract power" to create one or more
essences of a type appropriate to the original object.
     The drained object itself is now called "of nothing".  Unlike any
other kind of object, it can have new magics added to it.
     An alchemist can add power to such items by using essences
he made or found.  He does this with the technique "'A'dd power".  He
can then select a kind of essence, then the object he wishes to
restore magic to.  If he has enough essences, and the object does
not already have magics in it, the alchemy succeeds.

     A few pointers:
     -Recipies are - usually - logical. Acid essences don't make Dragon 
      Weapons.
     -Not all objects or ego-item types can be made using alchemy.
     -Alchemy is partially reversible.  Anything but weapons and armour 
      that can be enchanted using essences will also create them 
      if drained, but extra wand and staff charges have no effect.

     Some Recipies:
          Any alchemist worth his salt knows lots of recipes.  Here are 
     some to get the beginner started, and others may be discovered by 
     trial and error.

          essences of Acid:
          8 essences + any ordinary weapon = acid branding
          8 essences + Ring of Nothing = Ring of Acid
          2 essences + Wand of Nothing = Wand of Acid Bolts
          2 essences + Wand of Acid Bolts = one additional charge
          5 essences + Rod of Nothing = Rod of Acid Bolts
          1 essence  + Scroll of Nothing = Scroll of Curse Armour
          2 essences + Amulet of Nothing = Amulet of Resist Acid



HARPER:
     While any class can use musical instruments, only harpers can tap
the power of voice to aid themselves and hinder, dismay, and kill their
foes.  Unlike the spells of other classes, some songs can be persistant
- if the harper is prepared to continue making the considerable effort
needed to keep some tunes going.  This means that a low-level harper can
have a lulling song playing in the background while he uses beams of
concentrated sound to slay the critters he slows down.

     Harpers have four spellbooks, and play songs the same way as other
classes cast spells.  The most important song in any book is the second
one they learn:  "Stop Singing".

     A harper will also appreciate a collection of musical instruments. 
All instruments activate for songs, which allows the harper to spend his
precious energies on music that can only be found in spellbooks.  Some
rarer instruments increase Charisma (a harper's spell stat) and grant
various resistances.  Artifact instruments exist; they possess unique
powers.



POSSESSOR:
     The strange art of reanimating the corpse of a monster and making
it one's own can be of extreme benefit to those skilled in it.  The body
the player possesses can grant powerful abilities, such as increased
speed, summoning, healing, breathing, and various resistances, and often
gives the player a large number of hit points.  Possessing uniques is
especially neat.  

     Possessors leave their own body by using the 'm' command, and
choosing "[I]incarnating powers".  They then become a very vulnerable
ghostly being which travels to where another corpse is lying on the
floor, and possesses it by again using the 'm' command.  Once possessed,
many monster corpses allow the player to perform various special actions
(such as blinking or summoning) by using the option "[U]se your race
powers".

     All corpses alter the player's melee attacks.  The player always
gets one normal blow, but the next four (if present) are altered to
those of the monster whose corpse the player is now possessing.  While
the player always has access to all of the monster blows, he will still
lose four normal blows if the monster only has one.  These modified
attacks may be very powerful, and do various nasty things to your foes,
but do not take advantage of plusses to hit or to damage.



POWER-MAGE:
     Power-Mages can wreak an amazing amount of destruction, and they
don't even need spellbooks to do it.  As they gain levels (up to 40),
they memorize new, randomly generated, attack spells.  Note that they
possess no guaranteed utility or alteration magics, and can never alter
themselves.  Power-Mages just kill.

     They use their magics through the 'm' key.  They then select a
general group of spells, followed by a specific spell.  Power Mages can
learn more about a specific spell by browsing it; this is very useful
for chooosing the perfect spell for the occasion.

     Power-Magely spells can take the form of a bolt, a beam, a ball
(either centered on the caster or targettable), a meteor shower
(multiple balls in the vicinity of the caster), or an area (effects all
monsters in line of sight).



RUNECRAFTER:
     No other spellcaster can fine-tune magics quite like the
Runecrafter, who combine runes that control magical type and effects,
and then decides just how much effort the spell needs.  Runecrafters can
envoke the most powerful magics of any class, but are always desperately
hungry for mana.  They can get more mana by increasing Dexterity (their
spell stat), and by wielding special Mage Staffs.

     Runecrafters combine runes using the 'm' command.  They first
select a rune that controls magic type, then apply one or more runes to
fine-tune effects, (pressing ESC when done), and then input the amount
of mana they wish to expend on the spell.

     Spell Types (Some kinds are not listed, and are left for the reader 
     to discover...):

     Knowledge:  Identify all objects in affected grids, Self-knowledge 
          if Self rune is used.
     Life:  Heals monsters in affected grids, heals player if Self rune 
          is used.
     Fire, Cold, Lightning, Acid:  Casts magics of that element.
     Elements:  Unresistable damage.
     Mind:  A mind blast that badly effects intelligent monsters.  
          Temporary ESP if Self rune is used.
     Gravity:  A gravity spell that both does damage and wisks affected 
          creatures around.

     Spell Effects (all are listed):

     Self:  Effects the caster.  This rune can be used with any other;
          if used alone, only the caster's grid is affected.
     Arrow:  Spell will include a bolt effect.  This allows aiming.
     Ray:  Spell will include a beam effect.  This allows aiming.  
          Increases difficulty slightly.
     Sphere:  Spell will end with a circular explosion.  Increases 
          difficulty a bit.  Can be used alone, or with Self, Arrow, or 
          Ray.
     Power Surge:  Not currently recommended for use.  Increases
          difficulty 
          a lot.
     Armageddon:  Hurls down meteors of the magical type in the vicinity
          of 
          the caster.  Increases difficulty noticably, but can do a
          great 
          deal of damage.



SYMBIANT:
     Symbiants rely on the partnerships they form, hypnotizing creatures
and then "wearing" them:  "I get by with a little help from my
friends.".  Depending on the monster, this does nothing except protect
the player slightly (the worn monster takes some of the damage the
player would otherwise) or grant some very powerful attacks and
summons.  Symbiants only have two spellbooks, one found deep in the
dungeon, but have more than enough spells to keep their symbiotic
relationships strong.

     They cast spells normally, and can hypnotize adjacent creatures
that cannot move by using the 'U' command ('O' for roguelike commands). 
The monster becomes an object, and can be worn.  Symbiants, unlike any
other class, don't have to worry about being attacked by the monster
they are wearing.

WIZARD & PRIOR
        They are just the old mage & priest from vanilla Angband

ILLUSIONNIST
        Illusionnists focus on the strange Illusion realm and can't use
any other realms, but they can use ALL the illusion spells(other class
can only use the ones of the normal books)

DRUID
        A druid is in communion with the nature and the primal mana flow
of the earth which he can channel to it's own use.

NECROMANCER
        Necromancers have very special powers(actived by 'U') and can use
the nether realm. But their most special ability is that they can survive
to their own death. A necromancer when killed become an undead, slowly rotting
away and must kill a certain amount of monsters to drain life from them to
come back to life. If he/she dies in the undead form he/she realy dies.

DAEMONOLOGIST
        Daemonologists are trained in Chaos and Daemon magic, and they can
	learn every spells from these two realms.

=== Realms Description ===

CRUSADE: Drawing power  from  both  divine and  sorcerous sources,
the Crusade realm seeks to  aid the warrior in battle.  Its spells
are aimed at enhancement of fighting abilities as well as directly
dealing damage to the enemy.  Wielded by holy warriors,  it is not
as powerful  as the  major realms,  but one  who uses it  can be a
formidable threat to any monster.

SIGALDRY: Employed by minor wizards and dabblers in the alchemical
arts,  Sigaldry focuses on  drawing out relatively weak  elemental
and inner  powers  to both strike  enemies and infuse  energy into
immobile objects.  Associated strongly with the more potent magics
of Wizardry, it serves adequately as an all-purpose spells school.

VALARIN: The Valar, stewards of Eru, possess the inherent power of
the world itself.  Drawing out the  enchantments of earth,  water,
and air,  the Valarin realm  harnesses light  and life to  aid its
devotees.  Having the fullest  complement of  healing spells,  the
primeval powers of the universe can also be unleashed in lightning
and earthquake  and even  the rain of  falling stars.  The highest
power given to followers  allows them to become  equal in power to
the Valar themselves, albeit for a limited time.

NETHER: The dominion of Morgoth has permanently altered the infra-
structure of the earth,  imbuing it with his  native power that is
the  Nether realm.  The powers of  the undead  and corrupted  life
are at the call  of a Nether adept,  as well as the invocations of
haunting fear  and eternal darkness.  The lifeblood  of the caster
must sometimes  be sacrificed to  harness the  awesome destructive
potentials of the realm.


=== Notes on Summoned / Charmed Creatures ===

A friendly creature can be a mixed blessing. At first sight,
one might  think that  they can  make the game  much easier.
It is of course highly satisfying to send your pet Hell Wyrm
into  a Troll pit and wait outside,  listening for the howls
of agony and terror,  the sounds of  guts splattering, bones
crunching and so on.  But one should not expect  to gain any
experience for such a combat:  you will only gain experience
for creatures  to whom you  deliver the death blow yourself.
New experiences require hazards,  nobody gains experience by
sitting home watching the TV.
Secondly,  friendly monsters  are often so eager  to destroy
your opponents  they may  forget all about you,  and you get
trampled under their feet as they charge at  your foe.  They
are not  as smart as  the regular monsters,  since they have
given  up their free will to serve you.  So don't stand next
to that Snaga when your pet Cyberdemon brandishes its rocket
launcher!  Pets are also  rather easily irritable.  Once you
do something  which causes the slightest discomfort to them,
they will revert  to their normal behaviour and consider you
their main target.  This is something to think about  before
lighting up a room  if you have  pet orcs.  Needless to say,
nobody wants to be your friend if you are aggravating them.
Finally,  it takes  a lot of  mental energy  to maintain the
control over the charmed monsters.  The first monster or the
first few are 'free', but after that maintaining the control
will start taxing your mana regain rate.  The higher the sum
of the levels of your pets the less mana you will be able to
regain. Keep this in mind if you have a pet which can summon
or otherwise produce more pets...

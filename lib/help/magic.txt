
====== Magic ======


--- Spellcasting ---

     Spells are collected in nine books of magic. One you begin with, the
rest you can find in the dungeon.

Getting spell information:
      Press 'I' to look at the spells in a book.

Gaining new spells:
     You do not need to 'G'ain new spells in Ironband. You can potentially
cast any spell in a book you hold - though if you are not high enough level
and/or not intelligent enough, your fail rate may be high (even 100%).

Casting spells:
     You may cast any previously learnt spell of your level or less.  You cast
spells by typing 'm' or 'p', choosing a spellbook, and then a spell.  Casting a
spell takes a full turn.  
     If you don't have enough mana to cast that spell, you cannot cast it at all.

Mana:
     Your mana depends on your level and your Wisdom.
     You will notice that, unlike in other *bands, your mana (SP) do not naturally
regenerate as you move around or rest. You only recover Mana when you go deeper in
the dungeon. So use your mana wisely and retreat to the stairs if you run out.
     
Spell failure chance:
     Your spell failure chance depends on the spell itself (some spells are
inherently hard to cast), your level, and your Intelligence.  When stunned, all spells are harder
to cast.  

Wands and talismans:
     Wands let you cast a particular spell, just as if you were casting it from a spellbook.
The spell can still fail and still costs mana, but the failure chance is reduced and the
mana cost is 1 less than usual.
     Talismans don't give you any new spells, but they let you cast some spells cheaper.
The cost of all spells in a group is reduced by up to a quarter (e.g. healing spells, or 
fire spells). Talismans do not stack with wands, or with other Talismans of the same type.
     Some weapons, armor and other equipment can convey the powers of a Talisman if wielded.
For example, an Amulet of Regeneration, once worn, makes your healing spells cheaper.
     If you have enough magic objects, the cost of a spell can drop below 1.


--- Hindering your foes ---

     If it looks too tough to kill, perhaps you can knock it down a bit.  Monsters 
can be hindered in some way if you work hard enough at it.

     - Sleep : Sleeping monsters can't hurt you - until they wake up again.
     - Slow : If you can slow a monster, you are well on the way to killing it.
     - Stun : Sound blasts and ice can stun monsters, reducing their danger 
       to you.
     - Confuse : Monsters may be confused by bright light (blinding), confusion
       attacks, or spells of confuse monster.  They move randomly about and
       cannot cast any spells until the effects wear off.
     - Fear : Most monsters can be frightened.  Those that are will attempt to
       teleport away (if they have such a spell) or run.


--- Spell projection types ---

     The names of spells and magical devices sometimes give you information
about what areas they affect, and what shapes they take.

"Bolt", "Missile"
     Fires a magical bolt in a direction or at your chosen target.  Bolts are
stopped by the first monster or wall in their way.  Some also "Beam" upon
occasion.

"Beam", "Spear", "Lance", "Line", "Spark", "Cone"
     Fires a beam of magic in the direction you choose, or towards your target.
They are quite useful because they do full damage to every monster in a straight
line.  

"Ball", "Orb", "Storm"  (storms have a larger radius)
     If you target a specific monster, such spells explode centered at that
location.  Otherwise, they travel in the direction you choose, and explode as
soon they hit a monster or wall, or reach their maximum range.  These spells
only do full damage to the single grid at the center of the explosion, but can
affect monsters that can't see you.

"Dispel", "Confuse/Slow/Frighten/etc. Monsters"
     A fair number of spells affect all monsters in line of sight (no walls or
rubble between you and them, up to a range of 20).

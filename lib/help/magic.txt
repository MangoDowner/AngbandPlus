Magic
=====

sCthangband has several types of magic the player may learn:

Hermetic magic allows a clever character with an appropriate book to cast a wide variety of spells using SP to power them.
Hedge magic allows a character with an appropriate charm to cast a more limited set of spells using the charm's internal power to cast spells for as long as the charm remains.
Shamanism allows a charismatic player who has been properly introduced to a spirit by a high priest to call on it for a variety of favours.
Mindcraft allows a wise character to use his internal energy (called Chi) to cause a variety of increasingly powerful effects.

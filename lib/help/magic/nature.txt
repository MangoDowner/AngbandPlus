=== Nature Magic ===

NATURE: Early levels may be  rather difficult  for  a spellcaster
relying on Nature magic, as the early spells offer  only  limited
protection,  detection  and  curing  capabilities.   However,  at 
higher levels there are very useful offensive  spells  available,
especially should the  spellcaster  be  lucky  enough  to find an
extremely rare spellbook  called  "Nature`s Wrath".  Nature  also 
has a spell of Herbal Healing, which is the only powerful healing
spell outside the realm of Life magic.

=== Arcane Magic ===

ARCANE: Even more than Sorcery, Arcane magic is a general purpose
realm of magic. It attempts to encompass all 'useful' spells from
all realms, and almost succeeds,  with the probable exception  of
*Identify*.  This is  the downside of Arcane magic:  while Arcane
does have all the necessary  'tool' spells for  a dungeon delver,
it has no ultra-powerful high level spells. As a consequence, all
Arcane spellbooks can be bought in town.  It should also be noted
that  the  'specialized' realms  (i.e. other than Arcane) usually
offer  the same spell at a lower level and cost.  Arcane magic is
therefore perhaps not recommendable as one's only realm of magic,
but it should be a very nice addition to fill up the gaps  in the
selection of tools spells in another realm.

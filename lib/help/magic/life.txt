=== Life Magic ===

LIFE: Life is magic is 'good' magic; it relies mostly on healing
and protective spells. It does have a few attack spells as well,
but these are mostly used for harming and banishing foul minions
of evil.  It is rumoured that there is a secret high level prayer
which will make the  priest (or paladin) completely impervious
to all forms of hostile action.

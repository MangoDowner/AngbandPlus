=== Sorcery  ===

SORCERY:  Sorcery is a  `meta`  realm, including enchantment and
general spells.  It provides  superb protection spells  (such as
Teleport spells for fleeing and even  Globe of Invulnerability),
spells to enhance your odds in combat (Slow Monster, Haste Self,
Confuse  Monster) and,  most  importantly,  a vast selection  of
spells for  gathering information:  in  addition  to  the  usual
detection and identify spells, one of  the  standard  spellbooks
has a spell called Identify True, which gives you full knowledge
of a given object!  In  the  rare  books,  there are spells with
which  you  can  enchant  your  items  or turn unwanted items to
gold.  However,  Sorcery  has  one  weakness:  it  has no spells 
to deal direct damage to your enemies.

The four magic books available to Sorcery practitioners are: 

  1) Beginner's Handbook 
  2) Master Sorceror's Handbook 
  3) Pattern Sorcery  [RARE]
  4) Grimoire of Power  [RARE]

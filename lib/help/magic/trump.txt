=== Trump  Magic ===

TRUMP: Trump magic seems an independent source of power, although
its supposed association  with Chaos magic  has been mentioned in
several places. Although it lacks the unpredictable chaotic side-
effects of Chaos magic,  it has  a few spells whose exact  effets
seem  more or less random.  One such spell is Shuffle:  the Trump
spellbooks actually consist  of decks of trumps,  and the Shuffle
spell allows the caster to shuffle the deck and pick one card  at
random.  The effect depends on the card picked, and is not always
pleasant.  In the Amber universe,  the Trump gateways are  also a
major  method  of  transportation:  Trump  magic has,  indeed, an
admirable selection  of  teleportation spells.  Since  the  Trump
gateways can also be used to summon other creatures,  Trump magic
has an equally impressive selection of summoning spells. However,
not all monsters appreciate being drawn to another place by Trump
user. The only summoned creatures whose loyalty is guaranteed are
the Phantasmal Servants,  who lack  a will of their own  (but can
develop one, if you treat them badly).

The four magic books available to the Trump practitioner are: 

  1) Conjuring and Tricks 
  2) Deck of Many Things 
  3) Trumps of Doom  [RARE]
  4) Five Aces  [RARE]

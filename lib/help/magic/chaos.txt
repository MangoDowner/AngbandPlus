=== Chaos Magic ===

CHAOS: There are few types of magic more unpredictable and
difficult to control than  Chaos magic.  Chaos is the very 
element of unmaking,  and  the Chaos  spells are  the most 
terrible  weapons  of destruction  imaginable.  From Magic
Missile  and  Acid Bolt to the medium level  Fire Ball and
and Doom Bolt,  and  finally  to  the  awesome  spells  of 
Invoke Logrus, Mana Storm and Call the Void, Chaos  offers 
an unsurpassable arsenal of attack spells.  The caster can 
also  call  on  the  primal  forces  of  Chaos  to  induce 
mutations in his / her opponents and even him/herself, but 
otherwise, Chaos has no protective spells. Beware, though, 
Chaos spells  are  known  to backfire easily  and  product 
undesired effects. This is especially true in the  version
2.1.0 of Zangband and later, where the forces of Chaos can
easily  twist  the  hapless individual  foolish enough  to
invoke them, turning them horrendous spawns of Chaos.

The four magic books available to Chaos practitioners are: 

  1) Sign of Chaos 
  2) Chaos Mastery 
  3) Chaos Channels  [RARE]
  4) Armageddon Tome  [RARE]

=== Death  Magic ===

DEATH: There is no fouler nor more evil category of spells
than  the necromantic spells of Death Magic.  These spells 
are  relatively hard to learn,  but  at higher levels  the
spells give the caster power over living and the (un)dead.
Poison, vampirism, death spells  and  even hellfire can be
directed by the caster,  but the most powerful spells need
his / her own blood as the focus, often hurting the caster
in the process of casting.  Should a Death wizard find the
legendary tome Necronomicon,  he can  expect to gain  very
great powers indeed,  but at a cost: few that have studied
the accursed tome have retained their sanity.

The four magic books available to Death magic practioners are: 

  1) Black Prayers 
  2) Black Mass 
  3) Black Channels  [RARE]
  4) Necronomicon  [RARE]

BACKFIRING:

Casting Death spells can be hazardous to your health. If you fail to
get the spell off, and 1d100 is less than the number of the spell,
you will lose 1, 2, 3, or 4d6 HP and have a 1 in 6 chance of losing
spell number*250 XP if the spell was from Black Channels or the
Necronomicon. Hold Life prevents XP loss. If the miscast spell was
from the Necronomicon, you have a 50% chance of having your sanity
blasted instead.

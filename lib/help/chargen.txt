Characters
==========

Your character in Cthangband is defined by a series of statistics (usually abbreviated to 'stats').

The main stats of a character, and what they represent are listed below.

Character creation
==================

The method by which characters' stats are chosen depends on two options, use_autoroller and spend_points.

If neither is set, you should press 'a' to roll for stats until your stats are acceptable. Pressing escape will then start the game.

If use_autoroller is set, you should set the stats to the minimum values for each stat you would be happy with and then press 'a' to roll them. Higher values increase the time it takes to create a character like this.

If spend_points is set, you can simply press escape if the number of points listed at the bottom of the screen is at least 0.

If both are set, you may use either method. The game will indicate a rolled
character which has fewer than 0 points left for spend_points by displaying the
total in blue. You can accept this rolled character, but modifying it further
willl cause it to be treated as a character which has had points spent on it.

There are a number of keys which are used during character creation as follows:

s, i, w, d, c, h: Increase the specified stat for the purposes above.
S, I, W, D, C, H: Decrease the specified stat.
               a: Roll a character, repeatedly with minima if allowed.
               N: Set the character's name.
               G: Change the character's sex.
            R, r: Change the character's race.
            T, t: Change the character's template.
               /: Change from one birth display to the other.
               f: Save the current set of stats to a file.
               l: Load a saved set of stats for this race and template.
               =: Modify the birth options (see *****option=B*[custom.txt] for details).
               ?: Display help.

Primary Stats
=============

These are the basic defining features of your character. Each one is listed on a scale that normally ranges from 3-18. If one of your primary stats is on the very edge of human limits, it will be given a 'percentile' after it. For example, after 18 comes 18/01. These percentiles go up to 100, and then the stat is beyond the normal human limits and carries on counting normally (19, 20 etc.).

In general, a starting character may have one or two stats in the percentile range, but is unlikely to have any above that.

Your primary stats are determined both by your race and by the template that you start with.

STR (Strength)
This is a measure of your character's raw muscle power. It determines how much equipment you can carry without being slowed, and also gives a bonus in combat. With a high strength, you can penetrate an opponents armour more easily and do more damage.

INT (Intelligence)
This is a measure of your character's ability to think logically and work things out methodically. The main use of intelligence is in the learning of both hedge magic and hermetic magic. With a low intelligence, learning either of these will be severely hampered.

WIS (Wisdom)
This is a measure both of the amount of knowledge your character has, and the amount of common sense they possess. It is used mainly by mindcrafters, as only knowledge of the world will allow its Chi flows to be harnessed.

DEX (Dexterity)
This is a measure of how quick and agile your character is. Its main use is in combat, both to help you hit an opponent and to help you avoid being hit yourself.

CON (Constitution)
This is a measure of how tough your character is. A high constitution will give a bonus to the amount of damage you can take before falling unconscious.

CHR (Charisma)
This is a measure of how well you can get on with people. It is partly determined by looks, but mainly involved with personality. This stat is vitally important to shamans as they need to be able to persuade spirits without angering them.

Secondary Stats

As well as your six primary stats, you also have three secondary stats. These are determined both by your primary stats and by your skills. Each of these has both a 'Current' and 'Maximum' score, and the current score slowly regenerates until it reaches the maximum.

HP (Hit Points)
This score is based on the level of your Toughness skill, although you get a bonus based on your CON. It determines how much damage you can take in combat before falling unconscious and dying. Most attacks do damage rated in hit points, and when you run out you die.

SP (Spell Points - also known as 'Mana')
This score is based on the level of your Mana Channeling skill and on your INT. Casting hermetic spells costs SP, and when you are drained you need to rest before casting more. It is possible to cast a spell without having enough mana - although it is dangerous and is not recommended.

CH (Chi)
This score is based on the level of your Chi Balance skill and on your WIS. It is used up by using mindcrafting powers. Like hermetic magic, it is possible to use powers when you have run out of Chi, although risky.

RACES
=====

There are 30 races available for you to play in Cthangband. Each of them has its own advantages. Each race also has an 'EXP Factor' which determines how quickly that race learns. This is based on the human rate, and is a percentage (so, for example, an exp factor of 200 means that the race in question takes twice as long to learn as humans do). Each race also has a hit die size, so that a Barbarian (say) will get from 1 to 11 extra hit points per level (plus any for constitution). Each race also has modifications to the base stats for a character.

Barbarian (EXP Factor 120%, HD 11)
{STR:+3 INT:-2 WIS:-1 DEX:+1 CON:+2 CHR:-2}
Barbarians are the humans from the land of Cimmeria. This is a harsh land and its inhabitants, while being tough, have little time for learning.  Barbarians do not know the meaning of fear (or quite a few other words).  Wise barbarians can go into a fearsome berserk rage.

Broo (EXP Factor 140%, HD 11)
{STR:+2 INT:-2 WIS:-1 DEX:-1 CON:+2 CHR:-4}
Broo are a type of beastman, twisted by the dark gods that the race worships. The more they gain power, the more they are twisted.  Broo have seen too much chaos to be confused by anything, and are resistant to all forms of sound.  Clever Broo can use a fearsome growl to frighten anybody nearby.

Cyclops (EXP Factor 130%, HD 13)
{STR:+4 INT:-3 WIS:-3 DEX:-3 CON:+4 CHR:-6}
Immense humanoids with only one eye in their heads, cyclopes are resistant to the effects of all sorts of sounds.  Strong cyclopes can tear up large boulders and hurl them to deadly effect.

Dark Elf (EXP Factor 150%, HD 9)
{STR:-1 INT:+3 WIS:+2 DEX:-2 CON:-2 CHR:+1}
Elves that succumbed to the blandishments of great caverns, dark elves take little damage from darkness, and can learn to see invisible beings.  Clever dark elves can fire magic missiles.

Draconian (EXP Factor 250%, HD 11)
{STR:+2 INT:+1 WIS:+1 DEX:+1 CON:+2 CHR:-3}
The children of dragons that assumed human form, draconians always fall lightly, and gain resistance to various common forms of attack as they become more powerful.  Tough draconians can breathe out with devastating effect.

Golem (EXP Factor 200%, HD 12)
{STR:+4 INT:-5 WIS:-5 DEX:+0 CON:+4 CHR:-4}
Golems are not born, but made by arcane rituals that give them words instead of brains.  They are resistant to poison, magical slowing and paralysis, and can see the invisible.  They need but little sustenance, but normal food helps little.  Sufficently powerful golems gain a tenacious hold on their artificial life force.  Their skins are hard to the point of armor, and tough golems can make them even harder with concentration.

Great One (EXP Factor 225%, HD 10)
{STR:+1 INT:+2 WIS:+2 DEX:+2 CON:+3 CHR:+2}
Great Ones live in the north, where the Gods come down to disport with local maidens.  Their constitution never falters, and they heal and regain mana and chi quickly.

Klackon (EXP Factor 135%, HD 12)
{STR:+2 INT:-1 WIS:-1 DEX:+1 CON:+2 CHR:-2}
Insectile but larger than men, klackon brains cannot be confused, and the chitin is resistant to acid.  Nimble klackons can spit acid, and they move faster and faster as they become more powerful.

Kobold (EXP Factor 125%, HD 9)
{STR:+1 INT:-1 WIS:+0 DEX:+1 CON:+2 CHR:-2}
Ugly and below average height, kobolds resist poison and can throw poison darts if they are nimble enough.

Mind Flayer (EXP Factor 140%, HD 9)
{STR:-3 INT:+4 WIS:+4 DEX:+0 CON:-2 CHR:-5}
Tentacled monstrosities, mind flayers never become less intelligent or wise.  They can learn to see the invisible, and even to sense the minds around them.  Clever mind flayers can blast the minds of their enemies.

Nibelung (EXP Factor 135%, HD 11)

Skeleton (EXP Factor 145%, HD 10)
{STR:+0 INT:-2 WIS:-2 DEX:+0 CON:+1 CHR:-4}
Skeletons are the bones of humanoids, enlivened by necromancy.  Skeletons are resistant to poison and their (missing) eyes can see the invisible. Their bones take little damage from shards, and they have a tenacious hold on their borrowed life force, which wise skeletons can even regenerate by concentrating.  They become resistant to great cold as they gain experience.  They cannot eat human food, as it falls through their jaws, and potions they drink sometimes splash on neighboring beings.  They are not often taken aback by eldritch horrors.

Spectre (EXP Factor 180%, HD 7)
{STR:-5 INT:+4 WIS:+4 DEX:+2 CON:-3 CHR:-6}
Spectres have died, but have not left the Earth, perhaps on a quest. They need little food, but gain little benefit from it, and are not easily poisoned.  They see the invisible perhaps plainer than the visible, and their undead nature holds what life force they have strongly, and love nether.  Being immaterial, they are little affected by cold that is not extreme.  As they grow in power, they perceive the minds around them.  They can walk through walls, and clever spectres can howl to frighten those around them. They are only sometimes shocked by horrors from beyond.  Cuts in their insubstantial skin heal instantly.

Sprite (EXP Factor 175%, HD 7)
{STR:-4 INT:+3 WIS:+3 DEX:+3 CON:-2 CHR:+2}
Of faery blood, sprites fall lightly on their feet and are resistant to bright light.  Clever sprites can throw sleeping dust, and they gain speed as they become more powerful.

Vampire (EXP Factor 200%, HD 11)
{STR:+3 INT:+3 WIS:-1 DEX:-1 CON:+1 CHR:+2}
Vampires gain little sustenance from ordinary food, but tough vampires can feed and heal themselves with the blood of their foes.  They are creatures of darkness, and are immune to its effects.  Their unhallowed nature holds their life force close, resists nether effects, and protects them somewhat from cold and poison.  Vampires do need to avoid the light of the Sun, which scorches their flesh.  They are not often affected by eldritch horrors.

Yeek (EXP Factor 100%, HD 7)
{STR:-2 INT:+1 WIS:+1 DEX:+1 CON:-2 CHR:-7}
Unimpressive looking humanoids, but yeeks take little damage from strong acid, and can eventually become totally immune to the stuff. The shriek of a wise yeek can terrorize their foes.

Zombie (EXP Factor 135%, HD 13)
{STR:+2 INT:-6 WIS:-6 DEX:+1 CON:+4 CHR:=5}
Corpses that rise through unholy rites, zombies need little food, but have difficulty tolerating the food of the living, and can withstand most poison.  Their life force is closely bound to their bodies, and wise zombies can recover it with concentration.  Being animated by nether forces, they are resistant to them. Their eyes can see both the visible and invisible.  A zombie long out of its grave develops a resistance to cold, and cuts on its dead skin heal instantly.  They are partly immune to the dismay of eldritch horrors.

Templates
=========

Although all characters can learn any skill, a beginning character will start with a given set of skills depending on what template they choose. The template will also alter the values of their primary stats. It is important to note that once the game has started, the template of a character has little further effect.  The stat modifiers remain in force (if the character is playing in maximize mode), and the skills learned will be able to be raised in safer places than other skills.

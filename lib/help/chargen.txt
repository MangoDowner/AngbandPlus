Generating a Character
======================

Before you can play Hellband, you must generate a character. You have the choice 
of using 'quick start' (which will generate you a random character 
automatically) or manually creating one.

This help file explains the manual creation of a character. A quick-started 
random character is identical in all respects, except that the decisions are all 
made for you.

Sex
===

The first choice you must make is the choice of sex for your character. Sex has 
no impact on game play whatsoever. It is merely a matter of personal choice.

Race
====

There are 30 possible races to choose from. The race you choose will give you 
certain bonuses and penalties to your abilities. It may also provide you with 
certain special powers - or even limitations. You are advised to make your fist 
few characters human - since this is the simplest race to play (the human race 
is the 'default' race with no special rules or modifiers).

Each race has a 'Hit dice'. This values is added to a similar value provided by 
class to provide a number. Each time you go up a level, you will receive a 
randomised number of extra hit points between one and this total.

Each race also has an 'Experience Factor'. This will range from 100 to 255. This 
is added to a similar factor provided by class to provide a total experience 
factor. This factor is used as a percentage modifier on all amounts of 
experience needed to increase your level - for example, if you have an 
experience factor of 150, then you will need 150% of the 'normal' experience in 
order to go up levels.

Each race is listed below, along with its ability modifiers, hit dice and 
experience factor.

*Barbarian*
Barbarians are rugged humans from the north. Although technically the same race 
as other humans, their tough upbringing - with emphasis on physical prowess 
rather than on more academic learning - leaves them different enough to 'normal' 
humans to warrant them being described as a different race. Barbarians are 
immune to fear, and can fly into a berserk rage (min lev = 8).
Str: +3, Int: -2, Wis: -1, Dex: +1, Con: +2, Cha: -2
Hit dice: 11
Experience Factor: 120

*Cyclops*
Cyclopes are one eyed giants. Although large and strong, they tend to be 
somewhat clumsy and have limited intellect. Their one eye makes them look 
somewhat strange to other races, who often see them as 'freaks', and this 
somewhat hampers their social skills. Cyclopes can learn to use their great 
strength to throw massive boulders (min lev = 20). In addition, since their 
eyesight is not great, they have very well developed hearing - and are resistant 
to sonic attacks.
Str: +4, Int: -3, Wis: -3, Dex: -3, Con: +4, Cha: -6
Hit dice: 13
Experience Factor: 130

*Dark Elf*
Dark elves are underground dwelling elves who have a relationship to fungi in 
the same way that surface elves have a relationship to trees. They tend to be 
physically weak, but make powerful mages. Dark elves are naturally accustomed to 
darkness, to the point of being resistant to magical darkness attacks. Their 
innate magical nature enables them to learn to fire magical missiles at will 
(min lev = 2).
Str: -1, Int: +3, Wis: +2, Dex: +2, Con: -1, Cha: +1
Hit dice: 9
Experience Factor: 150

*Devilspawn*
Devilspawn are the progeny of mortals and demons. As such, they inherit some of 
the raw strength of their demonic parentage, but their mixed race tends to leave 
their thoughts confused and their forms misshapen. Devilspawn are remembered by 
their demonic anscestors, and as such they always get a demonic patron, 
regardless of what class they take. If they choose to follow the path of 
Diabolist or Demonologist, then their patron will take particular note of them 
and pay them far more attention. Whether this is a good thing or not is, of 
course, rather subjective. Their association with the pandemonium of hell allows 
them to resist both confusion and sound attacks.
Str: +2, Int: -1, Wis: -1, Dex, -1, Con: +2, Cha: -4
Hit dice: 11
Experience Factor: 140

*Draconian*
Draconians are - as the name would suggest - related to dragons. They are scaled 
and winged. Apart from their somewhat off-putting arrogance, they are superior 
to humans in almost every way, including many special abilities. Draconians' 
wings enable them to avoid all poison damage, and as they grow more experienced 
they can resist elemental damage. Firstly fire (min lev = 5), then cold (min lev 
= 10), acid (min lev = 15), electricity (min lev = 20) and finally poison (min 
lev = 35). Draconians can also breathe elemental effects in the same way that 
dragons can.
Str: +2, Int: +1, Wis: +1, Dex: +1, Con: +2, Cha: -3
Hit dice: 11
Experience Factor: 250

*Dwarf*
Dwarves are a short, stocky race. Although they are not noted for their 
intelligence, they are very pious and make good priests. If only they could 
reign in their loud boisterous in-your-face nature; they wouldn't get into so 
many fights. Used to feeling their way around in the dark, dwarves resist 
blinding attacks and magics. They are also master miners, and can easily detect 
secret doors and traps (min lev = 5).
Str: +2, Int: -2, Wis: +2, Dex: -2, Con +2, Cha -3
Hit dice: 11
Experience Factor: 125,

*Elf*
Elves are people of the forest. Tall and lithe, they make up in poise what they 
lack in physical strength. Elves excel at any mental discipline. Being partially 
photosynthetic, elves resist light based attacks.
Str: -1, Int: +2, Wis: +2, Dex: +1, Con: -2, Cha: +2
Hit dice: 8
Experience Factor: 120

*Gnome*
Gnomes are a small, playful folk. Whilst being very intelligent, they suffer 
from an almost chronic inability to take anything seriously. Gnomes are 
constantly on the move, and are impossible to paralyse or slow. In fact, with 
practice, gnomes can even teleport from place to place (min lev = 5).
Str: -1, Int: +2, Wis: +0, Dex: +2, Con: +1, Cha: -2
Hit dice: 8
Experience Factor: 135

*Golem*
Golems are not actually alive, as such. They are animated statues, carved to 
represent male or female figures. Their animating magics give them some 
semblance of intelligence, but they remain very slow and stupid. Luckily, their 
incredibly tough bodies make up for this. Being non-living, golems cannot digest 
food properly - and consequently need to rely on magical forms of sustenance to 
keep their energy levels topped up. Similarly, their non-living status gives 
them awesome defences. They naturally have a higher armour class than most 
people, and the do not get stunned or bleed. They are very resistant to poison, 
and they can naturally see invisible creatures. At higher levels, they can boost 
their armour class even further (min lev = 20) and hold on to their animating 
life force to resist life draining attacks (min lev = 35).
Str: +4, Int: -5, Wis: -5, Dex: +0, Con: +4, Cha: -4

*Half-Elf*
Half-elves are fairly close to humanity, just inheriting a portion of their 
elven parent's gracefulness.
Str: -1, Int: +1, Wis: +1, Dex +1, Con: -1, Cha: +1
Hit dice: 9
Experience Factor: 110

*Half-Giant*
Half-giants are not known for their subtlety. They are big and dumb brutes. 
Half-giants are so solidly built that they resist all attempts to drain their 
strength and they are resistant to shard based attacks. They can also use their 
affinity with the earth to learn how to transmute rock into soft mud (min lev = 
20).
Str: +4, Int: -2, Wis: -2, Dex: -2, Con: +3, Cha: -3
Hit dice: 13
Experience Factor: 150

*Half-Ogre*
Half-ogres are very similar to their larger cousins - half-giants. They have a 
slightly better chance of passing for human, though, since they don't quite have 
the size of a half-giant. Their strength resists damage, and their cave-living 
ways have given them a resistance to darkness based attacks. They are expert at 
setting traps, and can place magical runes that explode when touched (min lev = 
25).
Str: +3, Int: -1, Wis: -1, Dex: -1, Con: +3, Cha: -3
Hit dice: 12
Experience Factor: 130

*Half-Orc*
Half-orcs appear very similar to humans, until they open their mouths. They seem 
to have absolutely no control of their emotions and will rant and rave - with 
the strength of their orcish ancestry behind them. This ferocity doesn't seem to 
hamper their development as priests, though, as what they lack in brains they 
make up for in emotional fanaticism. Like their larger cousins, they resist 
darkness based attacks, and - whilst they do not resist fear - they can rally 
themselves into bravery (min lev 3).
Str: +2, Int: -1, Wis: +0, Dex: +0, Con: +1, Cha: -4
Hit dice: 10
Experience Factor: 110

*Half-Titan*
Half-titans are the largest of any of the races. Superior in almost every 
respect, only their bulk lets them down if they try to perform delicate actions. 
Their intelligence often comes as a shock to those who expect them to be dumb 
brutes  Half-titans are resistant to the effects of chaos based attacks, and are 
experts at spotting the weakness of other creatures (min lev = 35).
Str:  +5, Int: +1, Wis: +1, Dex: -2, Con: +3, Cha: +1
Hit dice: 14
Experience Factor: 255

*Half-Troll*
Half-trolls are the least intelligent of the giant races. In fact, many people 
consider them little more than beasts. Like the other giant races, they are 
strong but slow. Their bulk is such that their strength cannot be drained. 
Bigger half-trolls share the regenerating powers of their troll cousins (min lev 
= 15), and can learn to enter a frenzied state (min lev = 10).
Str: +4, Int: -4, Wis: -2, Dex: -4, Con: +3, Cha: -6
Hit dice: 12
Experience Factor: 137

*High-Elf*
High elves are the elves of the deepest forests. Being tied to the tallest and 
most noble trees, they are beautiful creatures who share none of the fragility 
of their lesser cousins. Like their brethren, they can resist light based 
attacks. Their senses are also magically attuned and they can see invisible 
creatures.
Str: +1, Int: +3, Wis: +2, Dex: +3, Con: +1, Cha: +5
Hit dice: 10
Experience Factor: 200

*Hobbit*
Hobbits are short, stocky humanoids who live in rolling hills and who love the 
fine things in life. Although small and lacking in strength, they are 
surprisingly tough and nimble - their dexterity being resistant to magical 
attempts to damage it. Being such connoisseurs of food, they have a widely 
varied diet. Even when adventuring, they seem to be able to find food to eat 
where no-one else would (min lev = 15).
Str: -2, Int: +2, Wis: +1, Dex: +3, Con: +2, Cha: +1
Hit dice: 7
Experience Factor: 110

*Human*
Humans are the basic race. They have no special abilities, and have no bonuses 
or penalties. Everyone else is considered to be good or bad at something 
compared to the human average. Their two big advantages are that they are their 
flexibility (although they have no bonuses, they have no penalties either - so 
they do not perform badly at any task) and the fact that they learn more quickly 
than any other race (they have the smallest Experience Factor).
Str: +0, Int: +0, Wis: +0, Dex: +0, Con: +0, Cha: +0
Hit dice: 10
Experience Factor: 100

*Imp*
Imps are small red-skinned fire demons. Although not terribly strong or smart, 
they are quite tough and quick. Imps are creatures of fire. They have a 
resistance to fire - and with repeated exposure this toughens up to a complete 
immunity to fire (min lev 20). As they grow, their senses also improve, allowing 
them to see invisible creatures (min lev = 10).They also learn how to toss bolts 
of flame around (min lev = 9), and even balls of flame (min lev = 30).
Str: -1, Int: -1, Wis: -1, Dex: +1, Con: +2, Cha: -3
Hit dice: 10
Experience Factor: 110

*Klackon*
Klackons are insectoid creatures. Physically they are better than humans in 
every way, although their insectoid brains are somewhat slower. Their tough 
chitin resists acid, and their ordered thoughts are impossible to confuse. 
Additionally, their wings help them to avoid any pit or fall. Klackons get 
faster as they get more experienced, and as they develop, they acquire the 
ability to spit acid (min lev = 9).
Str: +2, Int: -1, Wis: -1, Dex: +1, Con: +2, Cha: -2
Hit dice: 12
Experience Factor: 135

*Kobold*
Kobolds are small scaly humanoids somewhat related to both snakes and 
crocodilians. They are masters of poison, building up a resistance to it from an 
early age. They are also able to learn how to spit poison darts safely (min lev 
= 12).
Str: +1, Int: -1, Wis: +0, Dex: +1, Con: +0, Cha: -4
Hit dice: 9
Experience Factor: 125

*Mind-Flayer*
Mind-Flayers, also known as Illithids, are slimy monstrosities with tentacled 
faces. Physically, they are one of the weakest races, but they make up for this 
with their vast intelligence and mental powers. Both their intelligence and 
wisdom are resistant to damage. They can learn how to see invisible creatures 
(min lev = 15) and eventually they gain full ESP (min lev 30). They can also 
learn to project their mental energies in a direct attack on their opponent's 
mind (min lev = 15). Unfortunately, none of these mental powers can overcome the 
basic fact that most other races find them slimy and repugnant.
Str: -3, Int: +4, Wis: +4, Dex: +0, Con: -2, Cha: -5
Hit dice: 9
Experience Factor: 140

*Nephilim*
Nephilim are the offspring of angels. Their angelic ancestry makes them superior 
to humans in every way, and makes their constitution resist damage. They also 
heal more quickly. When Nephilim grow in stature, they can petition God directly 
for miracles (min lev = 30)
Str: +1, Int: +2, Wis: +2, Dex: +2, Con: +3, Cha: +2
Hit dice: 10
Experience Factor: 225

*Nibelung*
Nibelungen are an offshoot of the dwarven race. They tend to live deeper within 
mountains and study magic. As such, they are a bit more intelligent than most 
dwarves. Their magical nature lets them resist darkness attacks, and protect 
items that they carry from disenchantment. They share the dwarven ability to 
find secret doors and traps (min lev = 5).
Str: +1, Int: -1, Wis: +2, Dex: +0, Con: +2, Cha: -4
Hit dice: 11
Experience Factor: 135

*Skeleton*
Skeletons are undead creatures - former humanoids that now only exist as an 
animated set of bones. This status gives them both tremendous benefits and 
serious penalties. Because they don't have any flesh, they do not bleed. They 
are also resistant to attacks involving shards or poison. Their magically 
protected life force is harder to drain - and they can learn how to restore it 
(min lev = 30) - but this comes at a price. Most normal food simply slips 
through their bones and they need to find magical sources of sustenance. As 
skeletons get older, their bones get tougher and more resistant to cold (min lev 
= 10). Finally, skeletons lack eyes, but possess instead a magical sight that 
lets them see invisible creatures.
Str: +0, Int: -2, Wis: -2, Dex: +0, Con: +1, Cha: -4
Hit dice: 10
Experience Factor: 145

*Spectre*
Spectres are incorporeal undead spirits. As such, they can walk through walls. 
This disrupts them slightly, and whilst it cannot kill them it can leave them 
vulnerable. Their ectoplasmic form lacks strength and stamina, although it does 
not bleed. Having an unnatural lifeforce, spectres resist nether based, poison 
based, cold based and life draining attacks. In fact, nether based attacks heal 
them. They can see invisible creatures, and can learn to twist their form into a 
horrific visage (min lev = 5) and detect nearby creatures with ESP (min lev = 
35). Like most undead, they struggle to obtain nourishment from normal food. 
They must rely on magical means of sustenance instead. Spectres need never fear 
being without a light source, since their glowing ectoplasmic form emits as much 
light as a torch.
Str: -5, Int: +4, Wis: +4, Dex: +2, Con: -3, Cha: -6
Hit dice: 7
Experience Factor: 180

*Sprite*
Sprites are the smaller cousins of elves. Whereas elves are the spirits of 
trees, sprites are the spirits of smaller plants and flowers. Being basically 
elven, sprites resist light based attacks in the same way that their larger 
cousins do - although they are much smaller and more delicate. One advantage of 
this small delicate frame is that they can fly on insect wings over pits and 
trapdoors. Sprites get faster as they get more experienced, and can learn how to 
make a magical sleeping dust (min lev = 12). Sprites are extremely intelligent 
and make good magicians.
Str: -4, Int: +3, Wis: +3, Dex: +3, Con: -2, Cha: +2
Hit dice: 7
Experience Factor: 175,

*Vampire*
Vampires are undead bloodsuckers. They quite quickly learn how to drain the life 
force of their victims (min lev = 2) and this is the main way that they feed, 
since mortal food does them little good. Vampires must avoid light based attacks 
and sunlight, since unless they can find some kind of magical protection, both 
these will do them great harm. Vampires can see in the dark, to a limited 
extent, so they can still get around without a life source. Their undead form is 
resistant to nether, cold, poison, bleeding and life draining attacks.
Str: +3, Int: +3, Wis: -1, Dex: -1, Con: +1, Cha: +2
Hit dice: 11
Experience Factor: 200

*Yeek*
Yeeks are small furry humanoids with large bat-like ears. Although smarter than 
the average human, yeeks have a lot of trouble communicating because they can't 
speak any language than their own. To other races, their language is an 
unintelligible series of "Yeek! Yeek! Yeek!" sounds - hence the name that others 
have given their race. Their furry bodies are very resistant to acid, and with 
experience can become completely immune (min lev = 20). Yeeks can develop the 
ability to screech loudly at opponents whilst fluffing up their fur to make 
themselves look bigger and more frightening (min lev = 15).
Str: -2, Int: +1, Wis: +1, Dex: +1, Con: -2, Cha: -7
Hit dice: 7
Experience Factor: 100

*Zombie*
Zombies are one of the tougher types of undead. Unfortunately, the zombification 
process leaves them in a permanent state of semi-consciousness and anything 
mental is a severe struggle for them. Like most undead, zombies resist attacks 
based on nether, poison or life draining. They can also see invisible creatures. 
With experience, zombie flesh toughens up, and they get both resistant to 
bleeding (min lev = 12) and resistant to cold (min lev = 5). Like all undead, 
food does little good to zombies, and they need to find magical sources of 
sustenance. Contrary to popular rumour, zombies are actually quite dexterous. 
Their slow shuffling gait is from a lack of urgency and motivation rather than 
from a lack of capability.

Class
=====

Once you have chosen your race, you must choose your class. There are 13 classes 
to choose from.

Like races, classes provide a bonus or penalty to each ability and provide an 
experience factor and a hit dice. These are all added to those provided by race.

You are advised to make your first couple of characters warriors, as the warrior 
class is the simplest to play - not receiving spells or special abilities like 
the other classes.

*Demonologist*
Demonologists are people who have studied the magical arts of Chaos magic with 
the aid of an infernal patron. They are an arcane spell user, getting the Chaos 
realm and the choice of any other realm. They are better at Chaos magic than any 
other class. Demonologists have an infernal patron who may bestow gifts upon 
them, and they can learn how to resist the effects of chaos (min lev = 20). 
Demonologists have great difficulty wielding any weapon that is not a weapon of 
chaos, since their pact with their patron involves only using the power of 
chaos.
Str: -5, Int: +4, Wis: +0, Dex: +0, Con: -2, Cha: +1

Experience Factor: 30

*Diabolist*
Diabolists have made pacts with an infernal patron in exchange for physical 
prowess. As such, they are primarily warriors. Their patrons give them a small 
amount of divine magic from the chaos realm, and occasionally give them other 
rewards too. Diabolists can learn to resist the effects of chaos (min lev = 30) 
and fear (min lev = 40).
Str: +2, Int: +1, Wis: +0, Dex: +1, Con: +2, Cha: -2
Hit dice: 6
Experience Factor: 35

*Druid*
Druids are nature worshippers. As such, they use divine magic from the realm of 
Nature. They are better at nature magic than any other class. Like priests, 
druids are not allowed to use edged weapons unless those weapons are blessed. 
Str: -1, Int: -3, Wis: +4, Dex: -2, Con: +0, Cha: +3
Hit dice: 2
Experience Factor: 20

*High-Mage*
High mages study arcane magic from a single realm to the exclusion of any other 
magic. As such, their magical abilities are purer than most other classes, and 
they get more spell points than other classes do. However, their intense study 
leaves them weak in combat when not using spells. High mages of different realms 
have different names: Vivimancer, Sorceror, Naturist, Warlock, Necromancer, 
Summoner, Hedge Wizard or Zen Master.
Str: -5, Int: +4, Wis: +0, Dex: +0, Con: -2, Cha: +1
Hit dice: 0

*Mage*
Mages study arcane magic, but do not specialize as strongly as high-mages do. 
Mages receive two realms of magic of their choice. Mages struggle with combat 
when not using spells.
Str: -5, Int: +3, Wis: +0, Dex: +1, Con: -2, Cha: +1

*Mindcrafter*
Mindcrafters rely on the supernatural powers that their mind is capable of 
producing. Many of their powers are similar to spells and are used in the same 
way. Some powers, however, are simply passive, not requiring active use. 
Mindcrafters can resist fear (min lev = 10), protect their wisdom from damage 
(min lev = 20), resist confusion (min lev = 30) and even develop ESP (min lev = 
40). When not using their powers, mindcrafters can manage in combat, but are not 
as good as classes dedicated to fighting.

*Mystic*
Mystics are martial artists. As such they are masters of unarmed combat and 
increase their speed as they gain experience. However, they are severely 
hampered by wearing heavy armour. With experience, they can shrug off slowing 
and paralyzing attacks (min lev = 25). As part of their meditations, mystics 
learn divine magic from the Corporeal realm.

*Paladin*
Paladins are holy warriors. There are two types - true Paladins and Death 
Knights. True paladins get divine magic from the Life realm, whereas death 
knights get divine magic from the Death realm. In either case, their magic is 
not as strong as that of a priest, but they make up for this by fighting almost 
as well as a warrior does. Paladins can learn to resist the effects of fear (min 
lev = 40).
Str: +3, Int: -3, Wis: +1, Dex: +0, Con: +2, Cha: +2

*Priest*
Priests are divine magic specialists. Whilst not as good at combat as paladins, 
they are better at magic. Priests get divine magic from either the Life realm or 
the Death realm plus one other realm (although they can't take life and death 
magic). Priests who learn death magic are called Cultists. Priests take 
religious vows which prevent them from using edged weapons unless those weapons 
are blessed.

*Ranger*
Rangers are reasonable fighters, although they specialize in missile weapons. 
Like druids, they use divine magic from the Nature realm. They are not as good 
as druids at nature magic, but make up for it by also learning a second realm.

*Rogue*
Rogues are masters of stealth. Although they are not as good as warriors in a 
straight fight, they can backstab sleeping or fleeing opponents doing large 
amounts of damage. Rogues also learn a very small amount of arcane magic from 
either the Death, Planar or Folk realm. Rogues who learn death magic are called 
Assassins. Rogues who learn Planar magic are called Card Sharps and rogues who 
learn Folk magic are called Thieves.

*Warrior*
Warriors are the simplest class. They get no magic or special abilities, other 
than learning to resist fear (min lev = 30). They simply fight. However, they 
are tougher and better at fighting than any other class.
Str: +5, Int: -2, Wis: -2, Dex: +2, Con: +2, Cha: -1

*Warrior-Mage*
Warrior mages combine reasonable combat skills with two realms of arcane magic. 
One of their realms of magic must be Folk, but the other can be any. They are 
not quite as good at fighting as warriors, and not quite as good at magic as 
true mages, but they make up for their lack of strength by combining it with a 
lack of weakness.

Abilities
=========

Your character has six primary abilities: Strength (abbreviated to 'str'), 
Intelligence ('int'); Wisdom ('wis'), Dexterity ('dex'), Constitution ('con') 
and Charisma ('cha').

Each of these is normally measured on a 3-18 scale for a normal human. 
Exceptional humans (or people of other races) may have ability scores higher 
than 18. Scores that are 29+ are not possible for a normal person to attain 
except via magical enhancements.

Abilities that are above average give you bonuses on certain actions. Abilities 
below average give you penalties on the same actions.

*Strength*
Your strength score indicates how much raw strength your character has. Strength 
bonuses apply to bashing down doors, the distance that items can be thrown, the 
size of weapon that can be wielded, the amount of equipment that can be carried 
without encumbering you, how easily your melee attacks hit, how much damage your 
melee attacks do and how quickly you can dig.

*Intelligence*
Your intelligence score shows how smart your character is. It is a reflection of 
their thinking power, not knowledge and common sense. Intelligence bonuses apply 
to number of spell points (for some classes), number of spells known (for some 
classes), failure chance of spells (for some classes), disarming traps and using 
magical devices.

*Wisdom*
Your wisdom shows your knowledge and common sense. Wisdom bonuses apply to 
number of spell points (for some classes), number of spells known (for some 
classes), failure chance of spells (for some classes) and resisting enemy magic, 

*Dexterity*
Your dexterity is a measure of your speed and agility. Dexterity bonuses apply 
to avoiding theft, avoiding damage when falling, avoiding being hit, how easily 
your attacks hit and disarming traps.

*Constitution*
Your constitution is a measure of how generally healthy you are. Constitution 
bonuses apply to recovering from poison, recovering from bleeding, recovering 
from stunning and number of hit points.

*Charisma*
Charisma is a measure of the impression your character makes on people. As such, 
it reflects poise, looks and force of personality. Your charisma bonus affects 
the prices that you are charged for various services in stores.

In addition, various mutations or racial powers may be affected by the bonus of 
any of the six abilities.

During character generation, starting ability scores are either bought with 
points or rolled randomly (depending on which option you have selected).

Realm(s)
========

Once you have generated the ability scores for your character, you will be asked 
to choose which realm or realms of magic they will use. Some classes give you a 
free choice of realms, but others restrict your choice. In some cases, this 
choice will be automatic and this stage of character creation will be skipped 
completely.

Characters
==========

Your character in Cthangband is defined by a series of statistics
(usually abbreviated to 'stats').

The main stats of a character, and what they represent are listed below.

Primary Stats
=============

These are the basic defining features of your character. Each one is
listed on a scale that normally ranges from 3-18. If one of your primary
stats is on the very edge of human limits, it will be given a
'percentile' after it. For example, after 18 comes 18/01. These
percentiles go up to 100, and then the stat is beyond the normal human
limits and carries on counting normally (19, 20 etc.).

In general, a starting character may have one or two stats in the
percentile range, but is unlikely to have any above that.

Your primary stats are determined both by your race and by the template
that you start with.

STR (Strength)
This is a measure of your character's raw muscle power. It determines
how much equipment you can carry without being slowed, and also gives a
bonus in combat. With a high strength, you can penetrate an opponents
armour more easily and do more damage.

INT (Intelligence)
This is a measure of your character's ability to think logically and
work things out methodically. The main use of intelligence is in the
learning of both hedge magic and hermetic magic. With a low
intelligence, learning either of these will be severely hampered.

WIS (Wisdom)
This is a measure both of the amount of knowledge your character has,
and the amount of common sense they possess. It is used mainly by
mindcrafters, as only knowledge of the world will allow its Chi flows to
be harnessed.

DEX (Dexterity)
This is a measure of how quick and agile your character is. Its main use
is in combat, both to help you hit an opponent and to help you avoid
being hit yourself.

CON (Constitution)
This is a measure of how tough your character is. A high constitution
will give a bonus to the amount of damage you can take before falling
unconscious.

CHR (Charisma)
This is a measure of how well you can get on with people. It is partly
determined by looks, but mainly involved with personality. This stat is
vitally important to shamans as they need to be able to persuade spirits
without angering them.

Secondary Stats

As well as your six primary stats, you also have three secondary stats.
These are determined both by your primary stats and by your skills. Each
of these has both a 'Current' and 'Maximum' score, and the current score
slowly regenerates until it reaches the maximum.

HP (Hit Points)
This score is based on the level of your Toughness skill, although you
get a bonus based on your CON. It determines how much damage you can
take in combat before falling unconscious and dying. Most attacks do
damage rated in hit points, and when you run out you die.

SP (Spell Points - also known as 'Mana')
This score is based on the level of your Mana Channeling skill and on
your INT. Casting hermetic spells costs SP, and when you are drained you
need to rest before casting more. It is possible to cast a spell without
having enough mana - although it is dangerous and is not recommended.

CH (Chi)
This score is based on the level of your Chi Balance skill and on your
WIS. It is used up by using mindcrafting powers. Like hermetic magic, it
is possible to use powers when you have run out of Chi, although risky.

RACES
=====

There are 30 races available for you to play in Cthangband. Each of them
has its own advantages. Each race also has an 'EXP Factor' which
determines how quickly that race learns. This is based on the human
rate, and is a percentage (so, for example, an exp factor of 200 means
that the race in question takes twice as long to learn as humans do).
Each race also has a hit die size, so that a Barbarian (say) will get
from 1 to 11 extra hit points per level (plus any for constitution).
Each race also has modifications to the base stats for a character.

Barbarian (EXP Factor 120%, HD 11)
{STR:+3 INT:-2 WIS:-1 DEX:+1 CON:+2 CHR:-2}
Barbarians are the humans from the land of Cimmeria. This is a harsh
land and its inhabitants, while being tough, have little time for
learning.  Barbarians do not know the meaning of fear (or quite a
few other words).  They can go into a fearsome berserk rage.

{STR:+2 INT:-2 WIS:-1 DEX:-1 CON:+2 CHR:-4}
Broo are a type of beastman, twisted by the dark gods that the race
worships. The more they gain power, the more they are twisted.  Broo

to all forms of sound.  They have a fearsome growl that can frighten
anybody nearby.

Golems are not born, but made by arcane rituals that give them words
instead of brains.  They are resistant to poison, magical slowing
and paralyzation, and can see the invisible.  They need but little
sustenance, but normal food helps little.  As they age, 
they gain a tenacious hold on their artificial life force.  Their
skins are hard to the point of armor, and can become harder with
concentration.

{STR:+1 INT:+2 WIS:+2 DEX:+2 CON:+3 CHR:+2}
Great Ones live in the north, where the Gods come down to disport with

by earthly means.

{STR:+2 INT:-1 WIS:-1 DEX:+1 CON:+2 CHR:-2}

darts.

{STR:+0 INT:-2 WIS:-2 DEX:+0 CON:+1 CHR:-4}
Skeletons are the bones of humanoids, enlivened by necromancy.  Skeletons
are resistant to poison and their (missing) eyes can see the invisible.
Their bones take little damage from shards, and they have a tenacious
hold on their borrowed life force, which they can even regenerate by
concentrating.  They become resistant to great cold
as they gain experience.  They cannot eat human food, as it falls
through their jaws, and potions they drink sometimes splash on
neighboring beings.  They are often not taken aback by eldritch
horrors.

Spectre (EXP Factor 180%, HD 7)
{STR:-5 INT:+4 WIS:+4 DEX:+2 CON:-3 CHR:-6}
Spectres have died, but have not left the Earth, perhaps on a quest.
They need little food, but gain little benefit from it, and are not 
easily poisoned.  They see the invisible perhaps plainer than the visible, 
and their undead nature holds what life force they have strongly, and love 
nether.  Being immaterial, they are little affected by cold that is not 
extreme.  As they grow in power, they perceive the minds around them.  
They can walk through walls, and howl to frighten those around them.
They are only sometimes shocked by horrors from beyond.  Cuts in
their insubstantial skin heal instantly.

Sprite (EXP Factor 175%, HD 7)

age.

Vampire (EXP Factor 200%, HD 11)
{STR:+3 INT:+3 WIS:-1 DEX:-1 CON:+1 CHR:+2}
Vampires can feed and heal themselves with the blood of their foes, and
gain little sustenance from ordinary food.  They are creatures of darkness,
and are immune to its effects.  Their unhallowed nature holds their
life force close, resists nether effects, and protects them somewhat from
cold and poison.  Vampires do need to avoid the light of the Sun, which
scorches their flesh.  They are not often affected by eldritch horrors.

Yeek (EXP Factor 100%, HD 7)
{STR:-2 INT:+1 WIS:+1 DEX:+1 CON:-2 CHR:-7}
Unimpressive looking humanoids, but Yeeks take little damage from
strong acid, and as they age become totally immune to the stuff.
Their shriek can terrorize their foes.

Zombie (EXP Factor 135%, HD 13)
{STR:+2 INT:-6 WIS:-6 DEX:+1 CON:+4 CHR:=5}
Corpses that rise through unholy rites, Zombies need little food, but
have difficulty tolerating the food of the living, and can withstand 
most poison.  Their life force is closely bound to their bodies, and they
can recover it with concentration.  Being animated by nether forces, they 
are resistant to them. Their eyes can see both the visible and invisible.  
A zombie long out of its grave develops a resistance to cold, and cuts on
its dead skin heal instantly.  They are partly immune to the dismay of 
eldritch horrors.  

Templates
=========

Although all characters can learn any skill, a beginning character will
start with a given set of skills depending on what template they choose.
The template will also alter the values of their primary stats. It is
important to note that once the game has started, the template of a
character has little further effect.  The stat modifiers remain in force
(if the character is playing in maximize mode), and the skills learned will
be able to be raised in safer places than other skills.

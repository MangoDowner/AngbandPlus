PROLOGUE
----------

You are an adventurer, one of the many that lives in Portralis.
The world of Portralis is great, and with all the ancient temples,
dungeons, caves, and wonders of ancient times, an adventurer like
yourself has a lot to explore and learn. You decided to get your
gear, a basic set of adventurer equipment, as well as a licialhyd
in case something goes wrong, and to start your life as an
adventurer.

You walked on the roads of the kingdom of Jindar for several days.
So far, nothing special happened, and you are, in fact, starting to
get a little bored. Then, one day, you arrive in a small town. You
decide to ask some peoples around you about the town...

Peasant: "This? Well, this be the town of Udor! A small, rural town
in the middle of nowhere... I see you're an adventurer. Unfortunately,
other than maybe a few stores, you won't find much around here.
It's rather quiet. But we like it this way. At least it's quiet, not
like the giant city of Jindar... so much noise there! It's annoying,
we can't even take a little walk without hearing peoples, music,
merchants announcing their wares... Here, at least, you can sleep!"

"But, you know, perhaps you should go see the town's mayor. Maybe
he will have a few tasks for you. You know... perhaps hunt a few
animals or the like. I know, you probably wanted more than that.
Treasure hunts, exploring ancient tombs and temples... but we don't
have that around here. And that's a good thing!"

Disappointed, you hesitate between turning back, and going somewhere
else. Udor is definitly not what you're looking for. However, you
have walked in the wilderness for several days, and you need a place
where you can rest. So you decide to rent a small home, and spend
a few days here. Perhaps you should go speak with the mayor, and get
some easy work. Who knows, perhaps he will actually pay you well...

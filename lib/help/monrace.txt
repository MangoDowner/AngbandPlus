=== Monster races ===

| NOTE: This file contains exact information about various races abilities.
| This can be considered a spoiler by some.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all these races automatically get
"Monster" class.

Note that races tables still do not represent full information, as they lack
abilities table (they are extremely inconvenient to compare). So the charts
cannot show, for example, that a kobold archer shoots better that a large
kobold.

***** <Soul>
--> Soul

Lost soul is an especially unusual race. Their presence on the material plane
is very weak. They cannot use most of material equipment, though they can
take objects, dragging them into the ethereal plane, and pass through most of
walls (this, however, drains their hitpoints). They have huge penalties in
stats, and they have so few hitpoints that they can be instakilled by a mouse.
But, despite this, souls are one of the most powerful characters. A soul can
incarnate into *any* corpse of *any* monster, gaining hitpoints, powers etc.
of this monster, so that they spend few time in their natural form - typically
only to travel between dead bodies.

Souls always get a special class "Possessor".

Soul progression:

Possessor soul

Level 1-50: Possessor soul
	STR: -5  INT: -5  WIS: -5  DEX: -5  CON: -5  CHR: -5 
	Natural armor: 0
	Natural speed: +0
	Hit die: 1
	Infravision: 100 ft
	Equip: no weapons, no rings, no gloves, no armor/cloaks, no headgear, no footwear
	Innate attacks: none
	Innate properties:
		Immaterial

	Innate powers: none

This is attributes of the soul inself. Incarnating into any monster's corpse
inherits all monster's attributes.  For monsters from other racial
progressions, some data are present in this file; for others, you can easily
find it yourself.

Generally, it is a good strategy to develop one good body, instead of
changing them often. Note also that you can incarnate even in mushroom
patches, centipedes or equally pathetic bodies, but doing something in such
a body is, to say at least, somewhat difficult. Don't forget that bodies
that you deincarnate from rot away instantly! Also keep in mind that some
monsters may not leave any corpses, or may leave them very rarely.


***** <Ainu>
--> Ainu

Ainur are the demi-gods of Arda, the Holy Ones, created by Eru himself.
They created Arda with their Great Music. The most powerful of the Ainur
are called the Valar, the Powers of the World -- seven Kings and seven
Queens, the rulers of the Blessed Realm of Aman. Melkor Bauglir was one
of the Valar, but his name is not spoken anymore. He is now known as
Morgoth, the Black Foe of the World. It is Morgoth who you must slay
to accomplish your mission.

The lesser Ainur are called Maiar. They are much more numerous. The Istari,
or the Wizards, as the Men called them, were Maiar. The Balrogs were
corrupted Maiar. And Sauron himself was Maia as well.

Ainur powers are demi-godly. Apart from powerful magical attacks and
healings, they have the powers to change the world -- literally. They can
create clear lakes, hot lava pools, icy glaciers or dense forests with a
mere thought. They can also control many creatures of Arda, including the
lesser Maiar and the Ents, the incredibly strong tree shepherds of
Middle-earth.

Ainur are immortal, but their physical body can be destroyed -- and
disembodies Ainu is pretty impotent. Ainur can't be possessed.

***** <Ant>
--> Ant

Ants are strong and industrious insects, usually found in great hordes.
Despite their small size, their bite is very painful. They protect their
ant-heap so furiously that even men are sometimes driven away by them.

Giant ants are, thankfully, rare -- rare on the surface. But Morgoth delights
in breeding various abominations in his halls of Angband. Solitary giant ants
usually don't pose a particularly large problem for experienced adventurers,
but groups of them can be deadly.

The natural weapons of a giant ant is his jaws and acid. Some species may
use poison or, like the dreaded fire ants, other unpleasant elements.
Ants are well-armored against weapons, and resist acid, poison and shards.
They can summon their minions in much greater numbers than even the mages
can. Elder soldier ants can chew the passages in the walls.

Race king:     The Queen Ant
Race artifact: The Jaws of Queen Ant


***** <Basilisk>
--> Basilisk

Basilisks are rare but dreaded magical reptiles. Though they don't look
particularly scary, resembling large green lizards, they are deadly.
With a mere look basilisk turns his prey to stone -- forever. Therefore
sentient and non-sentient beings avoid basilisks at all costs. Basilisk,
unlike Medusa the Gorgon, is unharmed by his reflection in the mirror.
Non-living and/or non-seeing creatures are also unaffected by the gaze.

Basilisks are not particularly tough, but they are dextrous and rather
intelligent for lizards. They cannot eat organic food; they must feed on
their victims turned into stone. Their bite is rather poisonous, and they
learn to breathe poison rather quickly. Old basilisks can also breathe
nexus.

The most powerful kind of basilisk is a dracolisk -- not really related
to the dragons, but very similar in appearance and in his deadly fire
breath.

Race king:     The Werebasilisk
Race artifact: The Eye of Werebasilisk


***** <Beholder>
--> Beholder

Luckily, these horrible creatures usually only appear in the nightmares.
Meeting a beholder, even if you manage to leave unseen (rather hard, since
it has eleven eyes), can drive you crazy.

Beholders has one huge eye in the centre of its body, ten eyes on the stalks,
a big mouth with lots of sharp teeth, and not much else. It moves by
levitation -- rather fast, if it chooses so. Beholders are physically weak,
but their psychic and magical powers make up for it. With the gaze of its
central eye, beholder emits a very strong beam of disenchantment.
Other eyes can confuse, scare, sleep, slow, curse, mind-blast or cast
elemental bolts. Beholder's bite is painful, but not poisonous. All beholders
possess exceptional intelligence and telepathy.

Beholder relatives include the evil eye (larval form), the spectator, magic-
eating gauth, life-draining undead beholder and the master of beholder-kin,
beholder hive-mother.

Race king:     Omarax, the Eye Tyrant
Race artifact: The Eyeball of Omarax


***** <Dark Elf>
--> Dark Elf

Dark Elves are corrupted kind of Elven race. They prefer to live in deep
caverns, and hate bright sunlight. Their features are elven, but their jet
black skin and white hair make them easy to distinguish from High Elves.

There is no definite theory about Dark Elves origin. It is known that some
elves refused to come to Valinor at the beginning of the First Age, and
stayed in Middle-earth, and didn't see the Two Trees ever. These elves are
called Avari. Morgoth captured many elves at these days, but most of them
were corrupted into hideous Orcs. It is believed, though, that some of Avari
were seducted by Morgoth's promises, and remained elves, but fought on
Morgoth's side since then.

So, the Dark Elves are evil, and use evil magic. Young Dark Elves learn some
simple spells, but at certain age they must choose their career for the rest
of their life (they are immortal and don't die of diseases or old age, but
they can be slain).

Dark elven warriors and lords are brilliant warriors indeed. They can easily
master any weapon, and learn powerful attacks. They can strike their enemies
with extra force, hit an enemy who is several feet away with a spear, or
turn around and strike everyone near them. They are familiar with various
kinds of weapons and armor, and can estimate quality of unknown item very
quckly. Dark elves particularly favor poisoned darts as their weapons. Dark
elven lords learn some combat magic as well.

Dark elven mages and sorcerors specialise mostly in offensive magic spells.
They can cast elemental bolts and balls; ice and darkness storms are their
most powerful spells. They are also good at teleportation, knowledge and
summoning (elementals and demons) spells.

Dark elven priests and druids serve the goddess of the Dark Elves, Lol'th.
This deity is fond of living sacrifices, and priests and druids can curse
and sacrifice any creature to her pleasure. Like all good priests, they have 
excellent healing abilities. They can summon spiders (which are known as
"servants of Lol'th" among Dark Elves) or undeads to their aid.

=== Demonic races:

***** <Balrog>
--> Balrog

Valaraukar, the demons of terror, are among the most terrible creatures of
Middle-earth. Originally they were Maiar, the spirits of fire, but in the
early days of the First Age they were drawn by Morgoth. It were Balrogs who
saved Morgoth from the wrath of Ungoliant. The High Kings of Noldorin Elves,
Feanor and Fingon, were slain by Balrogs, and many other Elves and Men
perished in the battles with them. One of the last surviving Balrogs hid in
the Mines of Moria, and haunted them until the end of the Third Age. 

Balrogs look like huge humanoids cloaked in fire and darkness. The very sight
of a Balrog is enough to turn a weak-willed creature into an utter despair and
panic. Balrogs are exceptionally strong and still retain the wisdom of the
Maiar. They usually fight either with a flaming whip or with a huge red-hot
sword, and don't usually use magic (other than some summoning abilities). Some
Balrogs can breathe plasma.

Balrogs have some disadvantages in combat, though. The body of a Balrog is so
hot that it can burn even a fire elemental, let alone scrolls or staffs.
Balrogs are too large to use most weapons and armor efficiently. And their
heavy steps can be heard from a great distance. Last but not least, Balrogs
have no idea how to use ranged weapons -- their melee attack is more than
enough.

Balrogs are known to lead demonic armies, but they are not really related to
demons and should not be confused with them.

The question of whether Balrogs had wings remains opened at the moment. Since
no known legends ever mention a flying Balrog, and even imagining one is
difficult, PosBand assumes that Balrog "wings" are in fact just sort of
magical darkness, and doesn't grant Balrogs innate levitation.

***** <Demon (Baatezu)>
--> Demon (Baatezu)

Demons are creatures which inhabit one of the planes which are commonly known
as Hell to the mortals. It is untypical of them to enter the material plane,
but powerful spellcasters can summon them (although controlling a demon is
very hard). Demons appearance can differ, but they are easily distinguished
from other races. They have glowing bright red eyes, long claws and teeth,
sharp tails and typical devilish laughter. Demons greatly enjoy causing
physical or mental sufferings to other creatures.
 
There are two kinds of demons, Baatezu and Tanar'ri. Baatezu live in the Nine
Hells, and Tanar'ri inhabit the Abyss. For many centuries Baatezu and Tanar'ri
lead the Blood War, keeping each other busy (luckily for us). They look very
similar, though, and an adventurer who is unlucky enough to meet a demon is
unlikely to have the time to spot the differences.

Baatezu are better in spellcasting than in fighting (though they can make
formidable fighters too). Their spells can utilise fire, poison, nexus
or chaos. Greater Baatezu can summon lesser ones directly from the Nine
Hells.

Race king:     The Archdevil
Race artifact: The Horn of Archdevil


***** <Demon (Tanar'ri)>
--> Demon (Tanar'ri)

Demons are creatures which inhabit one of the planes which are commonly known
as Hell to the mortals. It is untypical of them to enter the material plane,
but powerful spellcasters can summon them (although controlling a demon is
very hard). Demons appearance can differ, but they are easily distinguished
from other races. They have glowing bright red eyes, long claws and teeth,
sharp tails and typical devilish laughter. Demons greatly enjoy causing
physical or mental sufferings to other creatures.
 
There are two kinds of demons, Baatezu and Tanar'ri. Baatezu live in the Nine
Hells, and Tanar'ri inhabit the Abyss. For many centuries Baatezu and Tanar'ri
lead the Blood War, keeping each other busy (luckily for us). They look very
similar, though, and an adventurer who is unlucky enough to meet a demon is
unlikely to have the time to spot the differences.

Tanar'ri are great fighters, and learn little magic. Lesser Tanar'ri,
such as torturers or quasits, usually fight by slashing their enemies
with long nasty claws, causing horrible wounds. Their larger brethren
are capable of wielding up to four weapons, and can be real killing
machines with them. They prefer whips and maces, but can master any
weapon. Ranged weapons are much less popular.

Magic abilities of Tanar'ri are limited to minor teleportation and dark
priestly magic, and single summons. Among the more interesting abilities
are weapon echanting and fire-branding of any non-artifact weapon.

Spellcasting stat is strength. Important stats are strength and constitution.

All Tanar'ri resist fire and nether (their existence differs from the mortal
beings' one); all but the lowest forms resist cold and poison. Chaos
resistance and fire immunity are gained later.

***** <Blue Dragon>
--> Blue Dragon

Legendary mystique reptiles, bred by Morgoth in the sinister halls of
Angband. Most of dragons naturally serve Morgoth, but it is said that some
were rebellious and escaped into the deep caves on the far East and South of
the Middle-Earth.  Blue Dragons, also known as Storm Dragons, breathe the
element of Air (usually in the form of electricity).

The youngest blue wyrmlings are pretty weak creatures. They cannot yet
breathe anything stronger than showers of sparks and must rely on their weak
clawing and biting attacks. They, however, grow quickly, and an Ancient Blue
Dragon or a Great Storm Wyrm is a terrible enemy, able to breathe electricity
and air massively, teleport or summon powerful electric discharges at will.

Like all dragons, Blue Dragons cannot use any weapons, or wear gloves or
boots on their large claws. However, they can put magical rings on six
different limbs.

Dragons' wings grant them speed bonus on high levels, up to +15. Also, their
scales provide excellent protection, up to AC 100 on level 50.

***** <Chaos Dragon>
--> Chaos Dragon

Legendary mystique reptiles, bred by Morgoth in the sinister halls of
Angband. Most of dragons naturally serve Morgoth, but it is said that some
were rebellious and escaped into the deep caves on the far East and South of
the Middle-Earth.

Chromatic elemental dragons, covered by scales with beautiful colors, are
known as chaotic part of dragonkind. They are evil and treacherous. But
sometimes a wyrmling is born, who has much greater affinity with the forces
of Chaos than just chaotic character. These horrible creatures are known as
Chaos Dragons.

Chaos Dragon's scales are glowing and shimmering with strange colors. Their
very shape is distorted by Chaos. It seems to one watching the Chaos Dragon
that its form will dissolve into writhing primal Chaos as soon as he turns
away from this visage.

The Chaos, the Logrus and the Void are the main forces called by the Chaos
Dragon. Although his form may seem somewhat fragile, their knowledge of
Chaos offers them wide range of powers, including chaos and disenchantment
breathes, calling the Chaos and the Void directly upon their foes, summoning
chaotic dragon, detection, identify and alter reality powers.

Like all dragons, Chaos Dragons cannot use any weapons, or wear gloves or
boots on their large claws. However, they can put magical rings on six
different limbs.

Dragons' wings grant them speed bonus on high levels, up to +10. Also, their
scales provide excellent protection, up to AC 100 on level 50.

The nameless Guardian of Courts of Chaos, a Great Chaos Wyrm, is the
mightiest Chaos Dragon alive. He uses a powerful chaotic artifact - the
Amulet of Chaos.

***** <Crystal Dragon>
--> Crystal Dragon

Yet another strange dragon-like creature. The body of a crystal dragon
consists entirely from crystal or precious gems. It is one of the most
beautiful creatures of Middle-earth. It is also very rare -- turning ordinary
dragon into the crystal one requires very powerful spells and lots of
crystal.


***** <Ethereal Dragon>
--> Ethereal Dragon

Legendary mystique reptiles, bred by Morgoth in the sinister halls of
Angband. Most of dragons naturally serve Morgoth, but it is said that some
were rebellious and escaped into the deep caves on the far East and South of
the Middle-Earth. Ethereal dragons, also known as pseudo-dragons, breathe
the Light and the Darkness.

Ethereal dragons are born on ethereal plane. They appear in our world as
either brightly shining or wrapped in darkness figures, with glowing red eyes.
Ethereal dragons are very clever. They have better intelligence and magical
device skills than most of other dragons. Their main weapon is their breath,
which sends strange light and unearthly darkness from ethereal to material
plane. Elder ethereal dragons can also breathe confusion on their opponents.
Among their other powers are abilities to use light to heal themselves, to
throw small but extremely powerful light spheres, to shift planes to
temporary become immaterial, and to call great storms of darkness.

Like all dragons, Ethereal Dragons cannot use any weapons, or wear gloves or
boots on their large claws. However, they can put magical rings on six
different limbs.

Dragons' wings grant them speed bonus on high levels, up to +15. Also, their
scales provide excellent protection, up to AC 100 on level 50.

The ultimate master of the Light and the Darkness is Antir, the Silver Wyrm.
He is known to hold the Crystal Orb, an artifact which gives even greater
powers of controlling ethereal light.

Angband. Most of dragons naturally serve Morgoth, but it is said that some
were rebellious and escaped into the deep caves on the far East and South of
the Middle-Earth.  Red Dragons, also known as Fire Dragons, breathe the
element of Fire.

The youngest red wyrmlings are pretty weak creatures. They cannot yet

Dragons' wings grant them speed bonus on high levels, up to +15. Also, their

***** <Shadow Dragon>
--> Shadow Dragon

The frightening shadows of Morgoth's dragons are perhaps one of the most
dangerous undead creatures. They are seen as gray mist, shaped like a
dragon, with glowing red eyes. Shadow drake is not as powerful physically as
alive dragons, but it is even more deadly. Its blows and breath can draw
even the mightiest warrior in his grave.

Creating an undead dragon is extremely hard and dangerous, and only the
powerful necromancers dare to do that. Baby and young dragons are not worth
that converting. The youngest shadow dragons were the mature dragons during
their life.

Shadow dragons' main stat is intelligence. Their constitution tends to be
pretty miserable.

Shadow drakes can breathe the clouds of fear and, later, nether and
darkness. (Nether breath is the most powerful but it doesn't affect most of
Angband inhabitants much.) Like all undeads, they are hurt by fire, light
and orbs of draining, but immune to cold, poison, nether, darkness and time
effects. Being essentially ghosts, they are immaterial.

Death drakes are more powerful undead dragonkind. They are much more
powerful physically. The gaze of the death drake is so terrible that it can
force sentient beings to obey its orders. The common undead equivalent is
phantom.

The dracoliches are sometimes also known as bone dragons. Unlike shadow and
death dragons, their body is fully material, and they cannot pass through
walls, but their powers are immense. When an ordinary lich would cast a mana
storm, the dracolich breathes the raw mana, and nothing can stand that
breath. They can summon lesser undead dragons as well.

The greatest shadow dragon in the history would be Glaurung -- if someone
manages to slay him, he will face his shadow.

***** <White Dragon>
--> White Dragon

Legendary mystique reptiles, bred by Morgoth in the sinister halls of
Angband. Most of dragons naturally serve Morgoth, but it is said that some
were rebellious and escaped into the deep caves on the far East and South of
the Middle-Earth.  White Dragons, also known as Cold Dragons, breathe the
element of Water (actually frozen to ice).

The youngest white wyrmlings are pretty weak creatures. They cannot yet
breathe anything stronger than mere snowflakes, and must rely on their weak
clawing and biting attacks. They, however, grow quickly, and an Ancient White
Dragon or a Great Ice Wyrm is a terrible enemy, able to breathe frost and
ice massively or teleport at will.

The unique ability of elder White Dragons is breathing extreme cold, which
affects their enemies' metabolism. Reptiles, insects, other dragons, hydras,
snakes and similar creatures move and act much slower, when exposed to such
cold air. By continuous breathing on them, White Dragon can bring them to
speed of about -40. Also, any non-unique creature has a small chance of
freezing solid and shattering. Unfortunately these very cold blasts of air
do less direct damage than simple frost or ice breath.

Like all dragons, White Dragons cannot use any weapons, or wear gloves or
boots on their large claws. However, they can put magical rings on six
different limbs.

Dragons' wings grant them speed bonus on high levels, up to +15. Also, their
scales provide excellent protection, up to AC 100 on level 50.

Scatha the Worm is the mightiest White Dragon still surviving in
Middle-earth. He carries a wonderful set of dragon scale mail.

=== End of draconic races


***** <Giant>
--> Giant

Giants and their elder cousins titans are noble immortal people, born at the
beginning of the world. Unfortunately Morgoth has corrupted almost all
giants, and they became evil and cruel. Still, sometimes a young noble giant
is found, eager to fight evil hordes.

Giants, as their name suggests, are very large. They cannot use small
weapons properly, and have large penalties to hit with them. Furthermore, it
is rather hard to find armour which fits on their bodies (brigandine,
plate and dragon armour do). They have huge strength and very good
constitution, but they are not particularly clever, wise or dextrous. Still,
they have good saving throws.

All giants have unique affinity with large boulders. Such boulders can be
created by tunneling granite walls (with digging instruments; stone-to-mud
spell won't leave anything). They are very heavy and rather difficult to
carry, but they cause very large damage when thrown.

Giants are always resistant to confusion. They quickly grow and gain more
resistances.

As anyone can easily imagine, the lord of giants and titans is a very tough
opponent. His name is Kronos. However, he carries a Rock of Kronos, an
excellent throwing weapon.

***** <Ghost>
--> Ghost

Ghosts are common lesser undeads, but, unlike zombies or skeletons, they
are fully sentient and retain their memories.  They usually occur
spontaneously, when a living creature dies in a particularly nasty way.
Its ghost will haunt the place of its death, attempting to revenge its death,
or, sometimes, demanding something from the living -- bury the body properly
or fulfill some old promises, for example.

Ghosts look like faint translucent apparitions of their former selves.
They float in the air, making absolutely no sound.  They are incorporeal and
can walk through walls, but this is not a very pleasant experience for the
ghost.  They are able to operate the material objects, but they remain
very weak physically (although their nature makes them dextrous).  Ghosts
fully retain their intelligence and wisdom; the latter is the spellcasting
stat.

Ghosts dislike the living, and often try to scare them.  However, ghosts
are weaker and rarely try to actually oppose them with force.  Some ghosts
can be quite friendly and even talkative, if they are not threatened.

Ghosts, like liches and vampires, are independent creatures and will not obey
anyone, unless forced.

The main strength of the ghost is its stealth.  It is absolutely silent,
invisible and immaterial, and could make a perfect thief or assassin.  Even
hobbit rogues cannot appoach such stealth.  Ghosts, being astral creatures,
can perform various teleportation powers, including Dimensional Door, easily.
And, as undeads, they can drain life force of living creatures and conjure
some nether attacks.  They don't have any really outstanding melee or magical
combat abilities, though.

Ghosts are sometimes confused with dreads, nasty pitch black spirits from
unknown plane, apparently trying to destroy everything and exterminate
everybody not originated on it.  Meeting a dread is usually deadly.

***** <Golem>
--> Golem

Golems are essentialy robots. They are conjured by mages from clay, stone,
flesh or other substance to aid them. Golems have no intelligence whatsoever.
They always obey the orders of their masters, if these orders are simple
enough. Typically the orders involve beating someone or something.

Golem looks like the tall man-like figure, but its face is absolutely
featureless. It is slow, and easily tricked. However, destroying the golem
is not an easy task. Its body is held by magical forces, and physical
attacks on it -- slashing the clay, crushing the stone, bending the steel,
or whatever -- simply have no effect. Only the appropriate spells can
stop the golem.

There are many kinds of golems. Some unusual golem-like creatures, like
pukelmen, colbrans and drolems, do not really belong to golem progression.
The final stages of golem evolution -- bone, bronze and diamond golems --
are capable of using counterspells on their foes.

***** <Hydra>
--> Hydra

Hydras are seldom encountered in northern regions. These ancient magical
reptiles are notorious for their extremely effective regeneration abilities.
If one of hydra's heads gets chopped off, it regerates completely in
minutes.

The youngest hydras have but two heads. As hydra ages, it grows more heads.
Mature hydra typically has 6-8 heads. Because of their native swamp
environment, hydras quickly become very poisonous. Hydra's venomous breath
can kill a young dragon. Elder hydras learn to use fire, and even summon
their kin.

The Lernaean Hydra, the only known 12-headed hydra, has the Crown of Hydras
on its largest head. This artifact can be useful for any other creature as
well.

Hydra progression:

***** <Kobold>
--> Kobold

The infamous kobold is a physically and spiritually weak humanoid with a
dog's head. Kobolds inhabit low levels of Angband. They like poisonous
dagggers, and all kinds of poison in general, as they are naturally
resistant to poison.

Most members of a typical kobold tribe are warriors. Still, their shamans
know some very rudimentary magic.

Kobold race is actually present as "normal" (not from "Monster" menu) race,
which can play with any normal class. The monster race of kobold is present
just in case you wish to know what do real kobolds feel.

The chief of largest kobold tribe is called Mughash, and all kobolds know
him and his poisonous dagger.

***** <Lich>
--> Lich

A horrible undead creature, lich is a wizard's skeleton, dressed in black
robes. Liches are among the most powerful undeads. They utilize dark
necromantic forces with one purpose: to eliminate all life. Naturally, liches
are among Morgoth's forces as well. But some of them decide that it would be
better to become rulers of the world themselves.

Liches are pathetic at melee combat, but their spells are fearsome. They
can use nether bolts and balls, healing and teleportation spells, powerful
dispellings, mind-affecting attacks and summoning undead slaves. Liches are
intelligent, but physically weak and not very wise. For obvious reasons,
they get very poor attitudes in town.

Elder liches eventually move into ethereal plane, becoming immaterial and
able to pass walls.

Like all undeads, liches do not suffer from cold, poison, darkness or
nether. Such attacks can even heal them somewhat. But any lich fears fire,
light and holy forces, as they deal extra damage to them. One of the
consequences of liches' necromancy is permanent -1 to light radius.

Vecna, the Emperor Lich, is the greatest of undeads; even gods feared him.
He possesses a great and perilous artifact - the Hand of Vecna.

***** <Naga>
--> Naga

Yet another kind of hybrid creature, nagas have woman torso and snake tail.
The woman part is beautiful, but it has bluish skin and speaks with hissing.
Most nagas are lawful and even noble, but evil. Most of nagas are employed as
guardians. Naga families sometimes also create large treasuries.

Nagas are strong and can easily bite or constrict their victims to death. If
that turns out to be insufficient

***** <Quylthulg>
--> Quylthulg

Quylthulgs are among the strangest creatures of Arda; very little is known
about them. They appeared in our world many years ago, but even Morgoth
himself doesn't know where did they come from.

Quylthulgs are small, pulsing mounds of glowing flesh. Most of them are
almost immobile; some of them can slowly move with pseudopods. Anyway,
quylthulgs' unequaled teleportation abilities compensate that. They have
absolutely free blinking power.

Quylthulgs are very bad in almost everything, except summoning and
controlling their minions. They get 1/2 experience from pet kills (as
opposed to 1/10 of all other races), and their pets can even attack unique
monsters. They learn to summon stronger creatures, ranging from yeeks
and orcs to Great Wyrms and Black Reavers.

Qlzqqlzuup is a master of quylthulg-kind. He carries a Ring of Ultimate
Domination, a powerful summoner's artifact.

***** <Skeleton>
--> Skeleton

Together with zombies, skeletons form the base of undead armies. Animating
the bones of a dead creature is a fairly easy task even for the apprentice
necromancer. The result is a scary-looking, but not particularly dangerous
undead creature.

Skeletons do not possess much intelligence; they are more like the machines.
Their bones are not as strong as zombie's rotting arms, but they are
more resistant to physical and magical damage. The unique ability of the
skeleton is adding the bones of its dead foes into its own body, replacing
the broken bones. Skeleton can heal inself that way very quickly if it finds
a large reserve of bones. (Generally, only bare bones -- for example, of
other skeletons or liches -- are suitable; extracting bones from the corpse
is too long and difficult)

Skeletons are not as good in fighting as alive warriors are, but their
stamina makes up for it. They are not affected by cold, poison, nether,
darkness, time and shards. They cannot be scared -- they have too little
intelligence to understand the danger. They have no eyes, and their magical
vision cannot be blinded or fooled by invisibility spells.

Skeletons are sometimes mistaken for liches -- another, much more dangerous
kind of skeletal undead. Liches have glowing eyes and black robes, and they
are much more capable in necromancy -- in fact, they are undead
necromancers. Skeletons have empty eye-sockets, and either put on rusty chain
mail and helmets, or don't wear anything at all.

The name of the king of the skeletons is Cantoras. He is found deep into
Angband halls.

***** <Spider>
--> Spider

One should never judge by appearance. Spiders are fine example. Although
they may seem puny and fragile, spiders' poison and webs can easily
prove this untrue.

Spiders are eight-legged and eight-eyed creatures. They are often called
insects, though in fact they are not. Spiders generally do not attack first;
instead, they weave webs and wait until some poor creature gets stuck in
them. Obviously, they are very stealthy. Their unique vision grants them
exceptional searching and perception abilities. Spiders are somewhat
fragile, but they are quick and dextrous, allowing them to overrun foes and
wait for them in safe place, with webs ready.

Spiders cannot use melee or missile weapons, biting and stinging instead.
They can wear four rings and four boots (two pairs) on their numerous legs.
They can also wear any armor, cloaks or headgear, although they accomplish
this in pretty funny way. Spiders have no suitable arms to wear gloves.

Spiders quickly grow. They eventually become very intelligent and magical,
growing into phase spiders or araneas. Phase spiders are extremely quick.
They are masters of teleportation, and though they remain weakly defended,
their almost free teleportation powers (including dimension door) together
with webbing, poisoning and deadly nexus attacks make them deadly killers.
Araneas are not so dextrous, instead growing large and powerful bodies.
They are masters of fire, mind-affecting and summoning magic.

The largest spider known is Shelob, Spider of Darkness, normally dwelling in
dark passages of Cirith Ungol. Her tough skin may make fine (though
terribly stinking) armor.

***** <Troll>
--> Troll

Trolls are generally regarded as one of the dumbest and the strongest races of
Middle-earth. It is often said that trolls were created by Morgoth in mockery
of ents; but the Wise say that Morgoth couldn't create any life at all, and
the trolls were actually just made from the rock of Thangorodrim. The trolls
must visit the surface only in the night; otherwise they will turn back to
stone forever. (The town level is an exception. It is so densely covered by
the smoke of Thangorodrim that even the vampires have no problem walking
there.)

The species of trolls include forest trolls, stone trolls, algroths, ice
trolls, cave trolls, water trolls, ologs, eldraks and ettins. The strongest
trolls are appointed to chieftains. Troll chieftains have considerable
influence in the Dark Lord's army, and are often accompanied by ancient
dragons.

Trolls are very strong and tough. They are nearly immune to pain, and it takes
quite a bit of hacking to kill one. Their regeneration abilities are matched
only by hydras. Troll can regenerate even its head (since there is not very
much to regenerate).

One of the greatest troll commanders is Rogrog the Black Troll, an
exceptionally strong creature, whose blow could kill a basilisk.

=== Elemental races:

***** <Air Elemental>
--> Air Elemental

Elementals are beings from the elemental planes. They appear on our material
plane as tall figures consisting entirely of their elements. They are good
warriors, often summoned by master sorcerors on the battle field. Elementals
can preserve their material shape good enough to handle any material
objects. However, their nature makes using certain objects very hard. Air
elementals, in particular, short-circuit some metal objects which they touch.

The unusual nature of all elementals helps they greatly. Their physical
stats cannot be lowered; they cannot be frightened, blinded, confused,
paralyzed or slowed by most of attacks.

Air elementals inhabit the Elemental Plane of Air. Their material form
consists of little tornados and cyclones, sometimes also clouds, lightnings
and rain. They are almost invisible with ordinary vision. By using magic, one
can see Air elemental as tall slim human figure. The only facial features
visible are large misty eyes.

Air elementals are not very strong, but few creatures can match their agility
and stealth. They can easily outrun their foes, hide somewhere, and then zap
them with a lightning bolt. Lightning bolts and magical cyclones are the main
weapons of an Air elemental.

One of the most useful abilities of Air elemental is absorbing the air to
increase their mana reserves. However, this is time-consuming, and requires
some open space.

Smoke elementals consist mainly of smoke (as opposed to air and steam). They
emanate loud crackling and are not as stealthy. Beside lightning bolts, they
can cast darkness (smoke) storms.

Race king:     Ariel, Queen of Air
Race artifact: The Ring of Elemental Air

***** <Fire Elemental>
--> Fire Elemental

Elementals are beings from the elemental planes. They appear on our material
plane as tall figures consisting entirely of their elements. They are good
warriors, often summoned by master sorcerors on the battle field. Elementals
can preserve their material shape good enough to handle any material
objects. However, their nature makes using certain objects very hard. Fire
Elementals, in particular, quckly burn any scrolls or staves that they are
carrying.

The unusual nature of all elementals helps they greatly. Their physical
stats cannot be lowered; they cannot be frightened, blinded, confused,
paralyzed or slowed by most of attacks.

Fire elementals are the inhabitants of the Elemental Plane of Fire. They
appear on the material plane as the tall humanoids, whose body consists
entirely of flames. The only facial features visible are bright eyes. Fire
elementals are more clever than most of other elementals, and can use
magical devices of our plane freely. They can conjure fire and plasma
attacks to defend themselves.

Magma elemental is a hybrid of Fire and Earth elementals. Young fire spirit
can become either a Fire elemental, or a Magma elemental. Magma elementals
consist of the hot lava. They are slower and clumsier than their cousins,
but they are also more tough. Magma elementals have to consume the walls
(melting them into their bodies) to sustain themselves. Greater Magma
elementals may learn how to heal themselves or to summon minions by melting
walls to magma. But anyway, melting walls is a very time-consuming activity!

The greatest Fire elemental who had ever arrived on the material plane is
Vargo, Tyrant of Fire. He carries the mysterious ring of Elemental Fire.

***** <Water Elemental>
--> Water Elemental

Elementals are beings from the elemental planes. They appear on our material
plane as tall figures consisting entirely of their elements. They are good
warriors, often summoned by master sorcerors on the battle field. Elementals
can preserve their material shape good enough to handle any material
objects. However, their nature makes using certain objects very hard.
Water Elementals, in particular, quckly shatter any potions or flasks that
they are carrying.

The unusual nature of all elementals helps they greatly. Their physical
stats cannot be lowered; they cannot be frightened, blinded, confused,
paralyzed or slowed by most of attacks.

Ice elementals are also in close relationship with water elementals.
A lesser water spirit must decide at one point whether it wants to be a
water or an ice elemental.

While elementals are not noted in great intelligence, Water Elementals
control all forms of water with ease, and therefore can cast cold, ice and
water bolts and balls. They can consume potions of water to increase their
health.

Water elementals' body can sustain fire attacks, but the clouds of steam
can limit their vision for some seconds.

The lord of water elementals is known as Waldern. Slay him, and you will get
the mysterious ring of Elemental Water.

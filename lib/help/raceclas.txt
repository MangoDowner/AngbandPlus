
====== Races ======

     There are eleven different races that you may choose among, representing
most of the speaking peoples found in Tolkien's books, plus Gnomes and Kobolds.
Races differ in vital statistics, and tend to be better at some abilities than
at others.
     Good races for new players are Dunedain and High-Elves (powerful but slow
at gaining levels), and Elves and Dwarves (good abilities, not too slow at
gaining levels).

***** <Human>
Human:
     A flexible and adaptive race, humans are found all over Middle-Earth, from
desert Harad to icy Horodwaith.  They have no special adjustments to stats, and
no special strengths or weaknesses.  This, combined with their solid hitpoints,
makes them flexible but not powerful adventurers.  Humans may choose any class.

***** <Half-Elf>
Half-Elf:
     A Half-Elf is a descendant of both kindreds; Elves and Men. They are rare
and very special individuals, and their steps are guided by destiny.
Half-elves have all-round good stats; their skills are better than Men (but not
as good as Elves). Their dexterity is sustained and they are native to forest.
(A half-elf will find more artifacts, vaults, excellent items and special levels,
but will also find dangerous out-of-depth monsters, which will probably kill
them eventually. You have been warned.)

***** <Elf>
Elf:
     Known as the Elder Race, and as the First-Born, Elves are famed for their
knowledge and craftsmanship.  They are somewhat weaker and less robust than 
humans, but have superior wisdom and intelligence and strong magical abilities.
They are fond of bows, somewhat weak in melee, and have some infravision.  They
sustain dexterity and resist light inherently. They are native to forest.
(Once an Elf pseudo-IDs a bow or arrows, they fully identify it.)

***** <Hobbit>
Hobbit:
     Hobbits are shy, retiring folk with enough good sense to share.  They live
in homes with circular entranceways built partially underground, and are the
smallest of all the races.  Although they are weak, have perilously few
hitpoints, and are very poor at melee, all of their other abilities are
extraordinary.  Hobbits are highly intelligent, dexterous, and hardy, have
innate infravision, and resist attacks on their life force.  
(Once a Hobbit pseudo-IDs a sling or shots, they fully identify it.)

***** <Gnome>
Gnome:
     Gnomes are the pudgy pranksters of the dungeon; if they can kill something
in a humorous way, so much the better.  They may be small and ugly, but can
outbargain and outwit just about anyone.  They are among the frailer races, and
not powerful in combat, but have solid basic abilities, are highly intelligent
and dexterous, have innate infravision, and -- most importantly -- are immune to
paralyzation.
(Once an Gnome zaps a wand, they fully identify it.)

***** <Dwarf>
Dwarf:
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  They are strong,
wise, tough, and have pretty good basic skills; although not very good at
casting spells, they make excellent priests.  Dwarves are quite good at melee
combat, have innate infravision, and -- a major advantage -- can never be
blinded.  They do have one big drawback, though:  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason,
screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a
miserable stealth.
(Once an Dwarf pseudo-IDs a helmet or heavy armor, they fully identify it.)

***** <Half-Orc>
Half-Orc:
     The bastard offspring of humans and orcs, half-orcs are ugly, strong, and
have very bad attitudes.  Their magic is a little suspect, as are most of their
skills, but they know how to fight and can take as much damage as they dish out.
Most other races dislike them and so they have a hard time in stores.  Half-orcs
have innate infravision and, like orcs themselves, resist darkness and its
effects.

***** <Half-Troll>
Half-Troll:
     Half-trolls are built like blocks of granite; no other race can match their
strength or recover hitpoints as quickly.  Their hand-to-hand combat prowess is
fearsome and they are amazingly tough.  Unfortunately, they do poorly at almost
everything else, are very noisy, need to eat a lot, and have a hard time in
stores.  Half-trolls will be bad at anything that requires heavy thinking.  They
have innate infravision and always have their strength sustained.  
(Half-Troll spell casters can wear heavier equipment than other races without 
losing SP.)

***** <Dunadan>
Dunadan:
	Dunedain are the descendants of the people of Numenor, who have
long lived among the shorter lived peoples of Middle Earth.
At first they may appear ordinary, and they are disliked by many
because of their nomadic existence. However, they have the blood
of Elros Half-Elven in them, and as the game goes on they will
slowly awaken to their destiny as one of the Kings of Men.
(A Dunedain has mediocre stats at CL 1, cannot enter shops, and 
needs many XP to gain levels, but at CL 10 they can shop and 
their stats begin to increase - a randomly chosen stat increases
by 2 points at levels 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 35.)

***** <High-Elf>
High-Elf:
The Noldor travelled from Middle-Earth to Valinor to dwell among the 
Valar in bliss. They returned to Middle-Earth to seek the Silmarils, 
but in doing so they had to slay their own kin, the Teleri. Though 
they are mighty and beautiful, the curse of Mandos is on them, and 
nothing they do will come to a good end. They are doomed by their 
own greed and pride. 
High-elves can see invisible (the Unseen Realm), are resistant to 
light and native to forest. Like ordinary Elves, they have special
knowledge of bows and arrows.
(As one of the Noldor, you will find the early game easy. However,
once you reach CL 27, you will begin to be affected by the Doom of
Mandos. This can have several nasty effects at random intervals. 
Try to finish the game quickly or you will probably die an unfair
death. You have been warned!) 

***** <Kobold>
Kobold:
     Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell underground.
They are dexterous and tough, but ugly, and have relatively few hitpoints.
Kobolds can see in the dark better than almost any other race, are very
stealthy, and -- their most important advantage -- are intrinsically resistant
to poisons of all kinds.

***** <Maia>
Maia:
     The Maiar were created by Iluvatar in the beginning of time. Among their
number are Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron, Melian, and the Balrog of Moria. 
They are powerful and skilled at all arts. Sometimes they are dispatched by the 
Valar to do some important mission in Middle-Earth, but only a limited time 
is given to them. In your case, you have only a little time to complete your
mission. You must proceed directly to the bottom of the dungeon to bring 
Saruman to justice.
(As one of the Maiar, you have great stats and skills, and you can see invisible,
but you must play ironman - you can never go up, only down.)

**** <Sprite>
Sprites are a race of winged folk who dwell in forests, meadows and secluded 
places. They can fly and quickly dart about from place to place. Although they 
are weak, and sometimes scatterbrained, they can be cunning. Sprites eat almost 
nothing - some say they live on air.
(Sprites' flight ability allows them to ignore traps and adverse terrain.)

====== Classes ======

     Your choice of class makes all the difference to how the game plays.  They
vary greatly in toughness, combat and magic power, and ability to notice,
detect, and avoid things.  Some suggested classes for new players are warriors
and paladins.

***** <Warrior>
Warrior:
     A hack-and-slash character who solves most of his problems by cutting them
to pieces.  He is unchallengeable with melee weapons, and is also good with all
missile launchers.  He becomes resistant to fear at level 30.  
Although a warrior gets a lot of hitpoints, he is 
poor at the dungeon survival skills, vulnerable to magic, and suffers greatly 
from his ignorance of spells and many magical devices.  He gets fast, detailed 
feelings on weapons and armour (pseudo-ID).
     Note that a Quickband warrior does not get an extra attack as in NPP. On the
other hand, with his good Strength and Dexterity, he will probably get plenty
of attacks to begin with.

***** <Mage>
Mage:
     A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack his way
through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat, deceive,
baffle, and escape.  A mage excels in the use of magical devices, and finds them
very handy when his mana runs low.  He has excellent magical defences, but
dangerously poor physical ones.  He has almost no chance of sensing wargear.
There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are
his true realm.  Intelligence is his spell stat.

***** <Priest>
Priest:
     Covenanted with a mighty and generous god.  He explores the dungeon only to
cleanse the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to fall into
his pack, well, so much more to the glory of the Church!  A Priest is familiar
with magical devices, preferring to call them "Instruments of God", but is not
as good as a mage in their use.  A priest can be a decent fighter, especially
when sanctified, but only with blunt or blessed weapons.  Unblessed edged
weapons (swords and polearms) violate the Church's strictures about shedding
blood, and wielding one will hurt his ability to pray successfully.  A Priest
has fast but weak pseudo-ID.  Wisdom is his prayer stat.

***** <Rogue>
Rogue:
     A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is capable
of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is a master of traps and locks, no
device being impossible for him to overcome, and his stealth often lets him
choose his fights.  A rogue's perception is higher than that of any other class,
and ofttimes he will notice a trap or secret door without having to search.
Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the powerful offensive magic mages
wield.  A rogue has moderately fast, detailed pseudo-ID.  Intelligence is his
spell stat.  Using the 'P' command, he can attempt to steal from monsters, and
set traps for unsuspecting monsters.  As the rogue gains levels, he can create
an increasing variety of traps by using the + command on an existing monster
trap.  He is exceptionally gifted with a sling, and gets an extra shot with
a sling when he reaches level 26.

***** <Ranger>
Ranger:
     The greatest of bowsmen, capable of eventually firing a bow twice as 
fast than most.  He can also hold his own in melee, and has some useful
spells to aid him in need; rangers have many talents.  His dungeon survival
skills are better than average.  A ranger has average-speed, weak pseudo-ID.
Intelligence is his spell stat.  He gets an extra shot with a bow at level
26.

***** <Paladin>
Paladin:
     A champion of the Faith.  He is close behind the warrior in melee, can
use all weapons comfortably, and has some useful prayers to enhance his powers.
Most of his other skills are average:  while his saving throw benefits from his
divine alliance, and his missile skill from his prayers, he is poor at magical
devices, stealth, and searching.  A paladin has slowish but detailed pseudo-ID.
Wisdom is his prayer stat.
(The Paladin gets 15% extra XP for killing evil monsters, but only 50% XP for
killing non-evil monsters.)

***** <Brigand>
Brigand:
      A Brigand is a thief, who simply wants to plunder the pits of Angband
to steal its greatest treasures.  He is close behind the warrior in melee.  
He is a master of traps and locks, no device being impossible for him to 
overcome, and has the highest stealth of all classes, which can frequently
let him choose his fights.  His dungeon survival skills are better than 
average, and he has a fast, detailed pseudo-ID.  The 'P' command allows 
a brigand can attempt to steal from monsters, and the 'O' command can 
set traps for unsuspecting monsters.  As the brigand gains levels, he 
can create an increasing variety of traps by using the 'O' command on an 
existing monster trap.  He is exceptionally gifted with a sling, and 
gets an extra shot with a sling when he reaches level 26.

***** <Druid>
Druid:
      A Druid is a master of all things natural.  He cannot hope to simply
hack his way through the dungeon, and so must therefore call upon the power
of nature for attack and defense.  A druid is not really complete without 
an assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells.  He can 
master the higher level magical devices easily, and has a very good saving 
throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.  Intelligence and Wisdom 
are his primary stats.  He is the weakest fighter of all the classes, and 
spells are his true realm.

***** <Barbarian>
Barbarian:
      A Barbarian is a wild man of the mountains. He is crafty, and a good 
warrior. When he fights in melee, he becomes enraged. The higher his rage, 
the more his speed increases. He can also spend rage for various useful 
abilities. The Barbarian's main disadvantage is that he is illiterate
and cannot use any scrolls. He also does not know how to zap a wand.
However, he can get by using town services and certain special abilities.
He is native to forest.

***** <Berserker>
Berserker:
      A Berserker is a feared warrior who becomes frenzied in battle. He 
gains rage much faster than the Barbarian, and is stronger in melee combat. 
He is immune to fear. On the other hand, he is illiterate like the Barbarian, 
and he does not know how to use wands _or_ staffs. He also aggravates 
monsters, who will come from a long way off to fight him.
He is native to ice.

***** <Sage>
Sage:
      A Sage is the most learned of the classes. He can cast mage, priest 
or druid spells. His intelligence decides how many spells he has and what 
his failure rates are, but his wisdom decides how many SP he has.
His failure rates cannot drop below 5%; also, he cannot use edged weapons 
(like a priest) or gauntlets (like a mage). 
He is even weaker in combat than a druid.

(+) The Paladin gets extra XP for killing evil monsters, but less XP for killing
non-evil monsters.

     To get the total hit dice and experience modifier, add the race and class
numbers together.  For example:  A Dwarven Priest has a hit die of 11 + 2 = 13,
so will get 1d13 extra hit points per level before constitution bonuses.  He has
an experience modifier of 20% + 20% = 40%, so will take 40% more experience to
advance than a human warrior.

     Value for classes are starting ability - final ability.  Note that prayers
and spells can improve many of these skills dramatically.

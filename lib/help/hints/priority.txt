The Poet's Guide to Prioritizing
================================

 Alrighty, folks. You have only 23 inventory slots to haul stuff around
 in. You can wear only one suit of armour, one shield, one helmet,
 one pair of gloves, one cloak, and one pair of boots. You can wield
 only one bow, two rings, one amulet, and one weapon. The amount
 you can carry is further curtailed by the limits of your Strength.
 What do you do?

 Prioritize, that's what! Make sure that you're carrying the optimum
 payload. Get the most 'bang', 'zap', and 'sgbkow' for your dollar and
 your pound. This document purports to tell you how.

 Resistances

 This is one of the most-asked questions in Angband. Which
 resistances are important? How do I get them? Is sound resistance
 better than light resistance? This is the order in which you should
 pursue the resistances.

 1. Acid. Fortunately, one of the easiest to get. Lots of monsters and
 traps use acid against you. At the start of the game, an Amulet of
 Resist Acid is OK, but pretty soon you'll want that slot for something
 better. Try to get a suit of armour and a shield that resist acid-
 resistance and elvenkind are better. Immunity to acid is the easiest
 one to get, and if you get it, hold on to it! No acid damage will
 accrue to you or your inventory ever again!

 2. Fire. Another common attack mode. Not as easy to get as acid.
 Armour of Resist Fire is OK if you don't have Resist Acid or
 Resistance, but not great. Getting fire resistance from a secondary
 source, like a cloak or a pair of gloves, is better. Immunity to fire is
 the next easiest to get, and if you're a spellcaster, it's a gooder! Your
 spellbooks, scrolls, and staves will no longer burn up.

 3. Cold. Common attack form, though the monsters that use it don't
 tend to move as quickly as the ones with acid or fire, so it's not as
 deadly in that sense. About the same advice for availability as Fire.
 Immunity to cold will protect your potions, but don't trade your
 Nether Resistance in for it.

 4. Electricity. Nowhere near as dangerous or common as the first
 three, but electricity still comes in at number four because it has a
 high maximum damage potential (the worst blast of electricity,
 unresisted, hurts WAY more than the worst blast of nether,
 unresisted). About the same advice as for Fire. Give up electricity
 resistance in favour of fire or cold, if you have to, but remember that
 there are potions and spells that help you resist fire and cold
 temporarily, and none such for electricity. You can get immunity to
 electricity, which should afford your rings and wands some
 protection, but it's hardly vital. Nether resistance is more important.

 5. Poison. Poison resistance is one of the most massively useful
 resistances you can get. It's a very common attack form, has a high
 damage potential, and you won't get poisoned anymore (no HPs
 draining away each turn) once you've got this resist. The Ring of
 Poison Resistance is OK, but a ring slot is ultimately too valuable to
 waste on it. Try to get it from armour or a cloak if you can.

 6. Nether. Probably the deadliest attack form at the highest levels,
 nether drains your experience points as it drains your life away, and it
 has a high damage payload. Nether Resistance is only going to come
 from an artifact or an item with a random resist, like a Cloak of
 Aman or armour of Elvenkind.

 7. Chaos. Just edges out Disenchantment on this list because this
 resistance has a great collateral effect: you won't get confused
 anymore! This one is notoriously difficult to get. You can try getting
 it with a Blade of Chaos, and a few of the Dragon Scale Mails, but
 other than that, it's just artifact and random resist time, baby.

 8. Disenchantment. One of the most irritating attack forms out
 there. Disenchantment resistance will not only cut the damage you
 take from such disenchanters, but it will keep your weapons and
 armour from being drained of "pluses" via this attack. You can get it
 from a few of the Dragon Scale Mails, but aside from that, it's the
 same deal as Nether.

 9. Blindness. Just edges out Confusion. This one's more important
 for spellcasters and non-dwarves. If you can't see, you can't read
 scrolls or cast spells. Bummer! On the other hand, this resist comes
 with quite a few of the helms, so it's not THAT hard to get.

 10. Confusion. Give this up if you have Chaos Resistance already.
 This bad boy keeps you from being confused. Not bad at all. It'll
 really save you against Hummerhorns and the like. If you've already
 got Chaos, put it just below Shards on the old priority list.

 11. Sound. Sound resistance protects you from all breath-induced
 stunning effects- which is nice, mind you, but it won't save you
 from getting knocked out by that Master Mystic that's kicking you in
 the head. You can get it from a few of the Dragon Scale Mails, but
 other than that it's the same deal as Nether.

 12. Nexus. Damn, but Nexus is irritating. It's not especially
 dangerous, though, so that's why Nexus resistance is down here. I
 only wish it protected you from the assaults of Nexus Quylythugs...
 Artifacts and random resists, campers.

 13. Darkness. There are a few things at the end of the game that
 breathe darkness for a fair amount of damage, so darkness comes in
 next. Not that handy at the start of the game, though, especially if
 you have Blindness resistance or you're a half-orc. Darkness
 resistance is pretty easy to get.

 14. Shards. This would be a bit more important if there were a
 bunch of things that breathed shards. There aren't. You won't get cut
 by the breath weapons of Earth Hounds any more, though, so that's a
 bonus. There are a few Dragon Scale Mails, and then there's always
 artifacts and random resists. 

 15. Light. OK, so it's not exactly the scariest attack form on the
 planet. Nothing breathes Light for any significant amount of damage
 (well, OK, Ethereal Dragons), but at least you won't get blinded by it
 anymore. Light resistance is pretty easy to get.

 Secondary Abilities

 Some items have the ability to protect you from paralyzation, or keep
 your experience points from being drained too much. Blessed
 Weapons and Crowns of the Magi have a random Ability, while
 Defenders and Holy Avengers sustain a random attribute. Many
 artifacts also perform these functions for you.

 1. Free Action. Unless you are a Gnome, this one's at the top of
 your list. Paralysis = death at high levels. You're not finishing the
 game without this one. Fortunately, there are several ego-items, a
 ring, and a lot of artifacts that give it out.

 2. See Invisible. Another vital one. If you can't see the invisible
 creatures by the time you reach the lower depths, you'll die. Period.
 Again, this one's pretty easy to get, with rings, a few ego-items, and
 many artifacts that'll do the job.

 3. Speed. The Holy Grail of Angband. You'll need it to live at high
 levels. Don't trade in your only source of See Invisible or Free Action
 for a Speed item (+3), though. Save it until you've got another source
 of the same, THEN put on the Speed item. Speed (+10) would be
 pretty tempting, though...

 4. Telepathy. Very few things are better than ESP- you can see
 most monsters coming from a long way off with this ability. It is
 especially good for warriors. The best news... it detects both Death
 Molds and Magic Mushrooms!

 5. Hold Life. This one's a sweetheart. It allows you to resist
 experience point drains- they usually fail, and are much reduced in
 effect when they do slip through your defenses. Gotta love it. It's not
 easy to find, though- a bare handful of artifacts and the fabled Robe
 of Permanence have it.

 6. Sustain your Prime Spellcasting Stat. If you're a Mage or a
 Priest, you definitely want your Intelligence or Wisdom sustained.
 Don't waste a ring on it, though. Some ego-items sustain stats.

 7. Stealth. Can't say enough about this one. The effects are subtle,
 but powerful. You'll get breathed on off-screen less often, you'll get
 the first hit more often, you'll get the drop on your enemies more
 often. Several boots and Elvenkind items supply this one.

 8. Regeneration. Heal faster. Who would argue with that? Of
 course, you've also got to eat more often, but then, that's what Slow
 Digestion and Satisfy Hunger are for.

 9. Sustain Constitution. A constitution-drainer can screw you over
 in nothing flat if he's fast enough. Your hit points will vanish like a
 summer frost. Again, don't waste a ring.

 10. Sustain Strength. If your Strength is low, a canny drainer can
 make you slow because your equipment will suddenly be too much
 for you to carry! Don't waste a ring.

 11. Slow Digestion. Don't bother if you're a priest or mage with the
 mana to spare, but it's not a bad investment at low levels. Don't
 waste a ring, use the amulet until a better amulet comes along.

 12. Sustain Dexterity. Not a huge issue, but you don't want to be
 losing blows with your weapon because of some fricking Dexterity
 drainer. Don't waste a ring.

 13. Feather Falling. At the lowest levels, you can die from falling in
 a pit. At high levels, who cares?

 14. Searching. Sit there for only two turns instead of six when
 looking for that secret door. I suppose if you don't have the Find
 Hidden Doors spell, it might come in handy.

 15. Sustain the Other Spellcasting Stat. Not exactly important,
 since you don't use it. If you're a priest, don't go out of your way to
 get Sustain Intelligence.

 16. Light. Wow. A permanent radius one light.

 17. Sustain Charisma. Umm.. nothing in the game drains Charisma
 except Time attacks and Morgoth, and this wouldn't protect you
 from the Time attack. How useful is this? The phrase, "nose on a
 fish" comes to mind...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Rings

 How do you know which ring to wear? The ring choice is one of the
 most important ones you can make. Here is the list of my top (non-
 artifact) choices for rings:

 1. Speed- you'd better believe it. A ring of Speed (+10) or so is an
 adventurer's best friend.

 2. Damage- these are so massively useful it's not even funny. A ring
 of Damage (+17) is certainly not unheard-of, and it will add 17 points
 of damage to your every blow. Yowsa.

 3. Free Action- this one's so far behind Speed and Damage that it's
 not even funny, but Free Action is a good choice if by some fluke of
 chance you're not getting it elsewhere.

 4. See Invisible- See Free Action.

 5. Poison Resistance- You know you want it.

 6. Strength/Constitution- The only two stat-boosters that are
 worth the trouble for everyone. Sometimes.

 7. Intelligence- Only if you're a mage with bad ring selection.

 8. Slaying- If the damage is high enough. Usually worth more to you
 in a shopkeeper's inventory than in yours.

 9. Teleportation- Uncurse it first. Keep it in your pack, don't wear it
 all the time.

 10. Sustain a Stat- Only if your ring selection sucks.


 Rings to Sell on Sight

 1. Accuracy- crap, but worth money.

 2. Protection- ditto, unless it's taking your AC from below 10 to
 above 10.

 3. Acid, Flames, Ice- all crap, but see Protection.

 4. Sustain Charisma- I usually destroy them out of contempt.

 5. Searching- crap.

 Inventory Management
=========================================================================

 This is a very important skill. Your Home helps out a little bit, since
 you can store things there that you won't need right away (like stuff
 you mean to sell later), but what about the things that you need in the
 dungeon? That's important! Here's the list of things you should be
 carrying, in no particular order:

 1. Spellbooks- if you're a spellcaster, and you don't have Immunity
 to fire, get several of each of the 'low' spellboooks so that they don't
 all burn up or disintegrate.

 2. Healing- potion form is obviously the best. Cure Critical Wounds
 potions cure Confusion, and potions of Healing and *Healing* are
 great. Carry a bunch.

 3. Teleport Self- staff form is the best, but the most susceptible to
 fire. If you have Resist Confusion or Chaos, and Resist Blindness,
 then the scrolls are better. Staves can be used at all times. If you
 have the space, carry around an uncursed Ring of Teleportation, and
 slip it on if you have no staff and are surrounded by Hummerhorns.

 4. Word of Recall- the Rod is best, followed by the scrolls, and
 finally the spell. You can't 'double recall' (cast twice to cancel the
 pull) consistently on the Rod, though, so be careful. 

 5. Teleport Other- the wand is much better than the rod. Monsters
 can't resist this spell. It could very well save your life.

 6. Speed- HUGE! Carry as many as you possibly can. The potions
 are the best (easily available and, in high numbers, difficult to
 eliminate completely) but the staff and rod are also good. Guard these
 with your life.

 7. Arrows- as many as your Strength reasonably allows.

 8. Food- if you don't have the spell Satisfy Hunger, you're stuck. Use
 Rations, they're the most flexible.

 9. Phase Door- unless you're a high-level mage, carry around a
 bunch of these scrolls. You can use them as a sort of 'relocator' so
 that you can continue to pump ranged attacks into monsters without
 letting them touch you. Useful as an emergency getaway in some
 cases, too. I carry as many as 30.

 10. Area-effect wand- like Cold Balls or Stinking Cloud. You never
 know when you might run out of mana.

 11. Resistance-hole Backup- Yep... sometimes you need to carry
 an item just in case you meet a particular monster. A dragonslayer or
 a different suit of armour are things you might be carrying just in
 case.

 12. Identify- not vital, per se, but damned handy on occasion. The
 staff is better than the scrolls.

 13. Rods- if you're a warrior, you may find that rods of detection of
 various sorts come in handy.

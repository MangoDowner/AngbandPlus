=============================================================================
1) Going down the dungeon - how fast is too fast?
=============================================================================

Different people play differently, so there is no one answer, but
here are some suggestions for different styles of play. If you are
less familiar with the game, the risk is higher, if you are more
familiar with the game, the risk is lower.  

In other words, people who have played longer can go down faster and still
die less.  So, find the speed that is right for you.  The fastest reported
player plays at 50 feet per level + 100 feet, which can be safely done for
the first 1000 feet with mages - with proper care, of course.  But other
speeds have been recommended, ranging all the way down to 5 experience
levels per 50'.  
 
If you aren't sure, then I suggest the following method:

For each level, follow the border of the dungeon and explore each room on the
outside of the dungeon.  (i.e. not the middle).  If you had no problem, then
go down a level.  If you did, stick around.  This is still pretty slow, but
is still reasonable for first timers.


=============================================================================
2) Basic Pointers
=============================================================================

Okay, let's start with basics.

(1)  Don't even so much as sneeze unless you have full hit points and full
        mana.  There's just no reason to explore without full health.

(2)  Don't invite trouble.  That is, when in a room with two sleeping monsters
        attack one, kill it, then the other.  Sounds stupid, but there is a
        very close scenario:  When fighting groups of monsters, fight them 
        -one- at a time.  don't run in the room and invite group beatings.

        An elaboration on this: if you are being attacked by a group, get into
        a hallway and fight from there.  That way, you -can- only be attacked 
        by one at a time:
                                    #.....CCC..........#
                                    #....CCCC..........#
                                    #######C############
                                          #@#
                                          # #

        In fact, you should almost never be beat on by more than one monster
        at once.  you can always run into a tunnel, or attack from around a
        corner if the monsters you are fighting have breath weapons.

(3)  If you see a monster you're not sure if you can beat,then -don't- 
        attack it.  Why take the chance?  Also, put your ego aside, and 
        run away if you start losing a fight.  Try not to run away at the
        very last minute, in case your teleport spell happens to pick a
        bad time to fail.  Also, be ready to run if you attack a fire type
        monster - and don't have any fire resistances.  Same for many others.

(4)  Probably the quickest way to die can be summarized in one thought.
        "All right, I've been hitting this guy a few times, he should
         be almost dead... OH NO!  I have no more (hit points/mana)!
         *dies about 5 turns later*.

        Don't run out of mana.  Don't run out of hit points.  If  you start
        running pretty low, then leave.  Don't say 'Well, I'll just save
        my last 6 mana points to teleport away' cuz if you roll badly, and
        are stuck in a fight with no mana, you die.  (Mages, anyway).

        Note, though, that panic spell casting can save your hide.  You have
        nothing to lose if you're gong to die anyway.  See section 4.e.

(5)  It is wise to kill all the easy monsters you can before taking on the
        harder monsters, i.e. kill any monster you see.  If you clear out
        lots of area, then if you have to run from a fight, you will have
        more clear areas to run to.  (and teleport to.  A troll may be
        no big deal when you are at full strength, but if some unique is
        beating on you, and you teleport to a room with a troll in it, 
        odds are you'll have to run from the troll in this case).

(6)  Check stores often.  Check all stores everytime you are on the town
        level.  You never know when something will be on sale. It pays 
        to keep valuables in your home rather than selling them right
        off - you never know when a 'bargain' could turn up.
        (has anyone seen a ring of speed +1 {to clear}?  how much was it?)

(7)  When you're going to attack something, you can always get first blow
        if you are careful. If your opponent is also moving (and at the same 
        speed), then if there is a single space between you, don't move into
        it. Wait on the spot for one turn (if you search rather than do 
        nothing you may pick up an adjacent trap at the same time). Your 
        opponent will move next to you, giving you the first blow.

         @.R    <-- wait!
         @R     <-- hit!  =)

        If your opponent moves at double speed (like a cave spider), you
        would move away from it if there was only one square between you,
        and stay still if there were two squares. 

        Using Fang as the example : 
        @..C   <-- wait!   
        @C..   <-- Hit!              

        @.C    <---if you waited, Fang moves and bites.  So, take a step back,
        @C..    <--- hit!  

        Of course, if you are using a spell or missile weapon, you can shoot
        at any time.  But you can always know whether or not your opponent
        will be able to hit you on the next turn and act appropriately.

(8)  When you find a chest, don't open it in a corridor. If it isn't in one 
        already, take it to a big room. Make sure the floor isn't all 
        cluttered with rubbish. Always search chests for traps. If you don't 
        find any, search some more. Disarm the trap before opening the chest.
        (Note: if you just cast disarm trap, you don't need to even search for
        the trap in the first place.)

        If you are just about ready to go down another level when you are
        thinking of opening a chest, wait, and take it downstairs with
        you. You will improve your chances of getting good stuff, since the
        value of the stuff in the chest is related to the depth of the
        level that you open the chest on.  Don't open a chest in the town.

(9)  Common locations of secret doors.

When you see either of these two patterns, search for secret doors at
the place marked ".":

 ##########            ############
    '.'                         '.#  (in any orientation, of course)
 ##########            ##########'#
                                # #

Also, almost all 'dead' ends have secret doors.  In general, there are 
usually doors near doors when in corridors.


Common dead ends which are a waste of time to search:

        # #
        # #
        # #                                  ####
        # #              ###                    ###
        # #              # #                    # #
  ####### ###   ########## ###########       r  #'########
            #                                o  '
  ###########   ########## ###########       o  #'########
                         # #                 m  # #
                         # #                    # #
                         # #                    # #
                         # #                 #### #
                         ###                    ###


                Some quick short tips from rec.games.moria
                ------------------------------------------

(10)  Summon Monster/ Polymorph Other will eventually pull up something you
        can't handle unless you can handle anything.
 
(11) Your Glyph of Warding / Rune of Protection will break.
 
(12) Just 'cause you teleported away does not mean you're out of danger.
 
(13) It is better not to be breathed upon.  (Most all the time.)
 
(14) Your Detect Monsters/Evil spell does not pick up all your opponents.
 
(15) It is better not to be touched.

(16) Always have some form of healing.

(17) Always leave yourself a way out.

(18) Give yourself some form of long range attack.

                        --- end of moria list ---

(19)  Look at creatures A LOT, since you get "strength" information that
        tells you how close the critter is to death.  This is ESSENTIAL for
        Priests/Mages as well---since if you're running low on mana, you need
        to know if it's about to die, or you are.


===========================================================================
3) Useless items aren't always useless:
===========================================================================

        The power of junk: If monsters that steal objects annoy you a lot, 
fill your inventory free space with junk. Once in a while, you'll just lose 
rubbish.  This can be quite a pain, however.  Learn to kill thieves from a 
distance.

        Don't throw that Wand of Clone Monster away! Instead, search for a 
monster you can destroy fairly easy and which drops some nice treasure. 
Choices are '$' for low-level characters, 'd' for mid-level and 'D' for 
high-level ones (no Dracoliches of course, but perhaps Ancient Blues or 
Whites...). 

Great Storm Wyrms, Ice Worms, or Hell Wyrms drop better treasure. This is
especially nice when you have immunity to whatever they breathe (e.g. if 
you've got Narya, clone Hell Wyrms etc).

Then, when you are alone in a room with that monster, hit it until it 
is nearly dead, clone it and kill the one you hit before. Hit the new 
monster until nearly dead and so on until the wand is exhausted. The Wand 
of Clone Monster is recharged very easily (low chance of losing it).
You will get lots of money, some nice items and many experience points.

There is ONE major time it's useful to let a critter breathe on you:
If there are a slew of weaker critters that are picking at you, AND
you are resistant to its type of attack, encourage it to breathe.  This
will wipe out all of these weaker critters, so you can thank the
breathing critter by destroying it.  (that's gratitude for ya)

There are times when a Wand of Wonder can be used quite safely (two 
illustrations from recent encounters):

                    # #
          ###########@############
          #                      #              #       
          #                      #        #######    d    
          #                      #          @        .   
          #                      #        ################
          #         n.o          #
          ########################
    
If you don't actually target any of the creatures, but off to one side,
then they can't be hasted, healed, or (worse!) polymorphed. Targetting
is a major help, but the idea still works without targetting. In the above
diagrams, you would aim at the dot. You miss out on line-of-sight effects 
like lightning bolts, but all the ball effects still work - and there
don't seem to be any bad (for you, at least) ball effects. About the worst 
that will happen is nothing. There is a vanishingly small risk that you 
have an invisible creature lined up - though High Elves should be safe from 
this as well.


=============================================================================
4) Skills for all dungeon levels
=============================================================================

Okay, you're fighting a bunch of monsters, and the room is getting filled 
with garbage!  This is bad - a monster surrounded by junk can't drop new
treasures.  (don't kill Wormtongue if he's surrounded by arrows!  Wait 'til
he takes a few steps into free space).  There are a few techniques for getting
rid of treasure:

        (1)  Quaff any useless potions, read any useless scrolls (if safe).
        (2)  Keep retreating as you fight, so the monster you kill next is 
                over 'blank' areas.
        (3)  Take the treasure, and throw it in a corner of the room.  In 
                fact, stand either in the corner or a square away from it, 
                and throw items towards that corner, like so:

                #jj  where the j means some junk object.
                #@j
                #### 

An item thrown towards the corner will fall onto another object, and 
dissapear.  So, you can get rid of as many objects as you want by just 
throwing them into this self-made garbage disposal.

        (4)  If you have the Create Door spell, stand in the middle of a 
pile of treasures, cast Create Door (a door will destroy any object on the 
space that it was created on), and then cast remove door.  Any object adjacent
to you is now gone.  Repeat for the rest of the pile.

Don't forget that traps take up space just like treasures.


If you run into a fire or acid breathing monster and there is a good scroll,
staff, or whatever nearby that you can't pick up right away then move
away from it!!  

If you have a WOR scroll and run short on room to carry things then 
ditch food if you have any (after eating).  You won't starve as long 
as you can get back to town. However if you only have _one_ Word of Recall
you are taking a big risk. What if it gets fried or stolen?

Stinking Cloud is great for Filthy Urchins, but not absolutely necessary:
If two can attack you at once, back around the corner of a building. 
They only come around one at a time (don't walk into them!!). If you
suddenly get two together, don't risk it, just back away ('round the next
corner). If you get in a real jam, Phase Door. Better than losing about
10% of your cash.

If you are a spellcaster with a recharge and an identify spell (eg mage,
ranger), or the priestly equivalents, and you have a couple of wands
or staves of the same kind, and you can't carry both, then rather than
just dropping the one with the fewest charges, recharge it. It does
not matter if the recharge has a high chance of failure. If successful,
identify it. Keep going until it has more charges than the other wand
of the same type. Now recharge the other wand. Keep recharging and IDing
the one with the lowest charges until one is destroyed. You can often
get a great many charges on a wand this way. A character who does this
will have really full wands, and so a better survival chance.
Of course, you must be in a relatively safe place to do this.


=============================================================================
5) Survival at low level (0-1000 feet)
=============================================================================

If you are willing to save up for a Wand of Drain Life (via the black
market), it can make many monsters much easier, but you might not get
enough charges to make this worthwhile.  This wand doesn't work on 
undead, though.

Once you get the hang of it, the first 1000 feet is a fairly safe area.
It can be played as fast as one experience level per 50'. This is pretty 
fast, however.  
  
You stand a chance of dying a few times if you play this way:
         level 2 - Fang and Grip can be a pain if you're only level 2. 
If you stay at full health you shouldn't be at much risk.  Use Magic Missiles,
potions of oil, and/or missile weapons.  
        level 8 - Wormtongue is easy to handle if you buy yourself a light
crossbow, reasonably enchanted, and quaff a potion of speed before you attack
him.  Kill him with room around him so he has room to drop his stuff.
Flasks of oil can also be used effectively against Wormy.

(Again, don't be dumb.  If the first thing Wormtongue does is frost bolt you,
LEAVE.  You haven't done any damage yet, and you're not at full strength 
anymore - why bother?)  Wormtongue can dish out a -lot- of damage quickly if
you get unlucky.  Just leave before he kills you, and try again.

If you are fighting things like baby dragons, where you can take one breath
weapon, but not 3-4, then you are often better off fighting toe-to-toe than 
from a distance.  At least getting clawed and bitten won't fry your potion of
speed.  They breathe much less often when they also have the choice of
biting and clawing you.

Besides that, the first 1000 feet isn't too bad.  Most uniques can easily be 
taken out with a few phase doors, the (+8,+8) light crossbow, and bolts.


===========================================================================
6) Survival at mid level (1000-1700 feet)
===========================================================================

Things get progressively harder and harder from here on.

Expect more and more groups of monsters.  Especially hounds.  Take out all 
that you can, then teleport away, heal, then come back and kill as many more 
as possible.  It's nice to keep beating on the same group of monsters, rather
than waking up a number of groups of monsters (it becomes very hard without a
unique weapon to kill a group in one attempt, but a good missile weapon can
do the trick).

Keep Potions of Speed at all times - there are a lot of speed 2 monsters,
who can -really- dish out the damage. 

   Stay the same, keep scanning with Detect type spells before you go forth
into uncharted areas.  Learn as much as you can about where you're going
before you actually go there.  Retreat if you drop to 1/3 hp or Mana and still
haven't taken out the same creature you started fighting.  If a creature drops
you more than half your HP in one `turn', retreat and re-think strategy or
better prepare.

Teleport Away items are no longer optional, they're essential.  Save an
inventory slot for a Rod of Teleport Away.  Two or three if you're a 
warrior. Keep an eye out for Wands of same.  If you're a priest, keep your 
eyes open for the prayer book Ethereal Openings -- it's the first of the 
"special" prayerbooks, is reasonably common below around 1200', and has a 
Teleport Away prayer in it.

The failure rate is a bit high when you first get it to rely on this spell.

===========================================================================
7) Analysis of levels > 1700 feet
===========================================================================

There seems to be a substantial jump in nastiness at around 1750-2000'.
Sort of like in Moria.  By here you'll want at least the elemental 
resistances (fire/frost/acid/lightning, and poison if possible)

2000 - 2500 ft.  Like 1000 - 1500 it seems; progressively nastier but no real
sudden onset of nastiness. Watch for speed items and good armor, e.g., DSMs.
They're uncommon, but, with the general increase in treasure here, quite 
possible.  Spiffy rooms, of varying degrees of spiffiness, become common 
here.  That's where you'll see most of the really nasty monsters.

2500 - 3500.  Over this 1000 feet or so, there is a big jump in general
nastiness.  Hell Wyrms (and worse), Chaos/Nether/Ether Hounds, high level
undead (Nightcrawlers, Black Reavers, etc).  These monsters will frequently
appear outside of spiffy rooms (aka vaults).  Undead pits, VERY difficult
and dangerous even for high level players, become common about here.

Undead pits are probably best avoided, especially when you first enounter 
them. They are usually not worth the hassle. However, there are some hints
for tackling them elsewhere in this guide.  The unique angels also appear 
around this depth and are probably worth avoiding.

3500 - 4950.  Except for high level uniques, pretty much anything that can 
happen in the 4000's can happen in the high 3000's.  This is because the 
highest level non-unique monsters are about level 75.  So it doesn't get 
wildly nastier, although nasty monsters get progressively more numerous as 
you descend.


===========================================================================
8) Levels where object X becomes common and other noteworthy things.
===========================================================================

There are spoiler sheets for this, but remember the standard levels for
gain stat potions:

1500 - 1600 feet - the other stats besides Charisma.  Charisma potions
aren't particularly necessary, and are cheap, so don't hang around 1000
feet merely for Charisma.
        1500 are physical stat potions - STR, DEX, CON
        1600 are mental   stat potions - INT, WIS

At 2000 or so (I forget) there are Augmentation potions, but it's a pretty
rough jungle down there.


===========================================================================
9) Strategies of various winners
===========================================================================

~From: Guy Evans <Guy.Evans@brunel.ac.uk> :

Having hung around at 1000ft for free action I am usually around level 25 odd.
I then tend to dive fairly rapidly to around 1500-1600ft for the gain stat
potions.  This is when the game gets hard and interesting :-)  I stay at
around this depth till all my stats are maxed - I find this a very boring
part of the game.  

Once my stats are maxed I dive again, this time to around 2500ft making
money by selling extra gain stat potions and  any dragon scale mails etc.
Once I have around 1.3 million buy a ring of speed.  Don't go below 2500
without a speed item.  Usually by now the character is fairly gross and can 
drop at a reasonable rate to 4950ft.  Note my last 2 completions didn't find 
boots of speed till they had hung around at 4950ft for a _long_ time (you need
to have 2 to kill Morgorth as a gnome mage).  That is it's easily possible to
survive with only 1 speed item for the majority of the game (slowing down to 
fast when killing Tiamat is always interesting though!).


===========================================================================
10) Things to do if you're going to die the next turn
===========================================================================

These are things you shouldn't do on a regular basis.  But, if you're about
to die, the rules change.  
        
        (1)  Cast a teleport/phase door spell, even if you don't have the 
mana.  You might pass out and die, but more likely, you'll teleport out, and
maybe lose a constitution point.  Much better than dying.
        (2) Do a last minute Bash.  You might even stun the monster. 
        (3) Shoot the monster with a Wand of Polymorph. 
        (4) Shoot the monster with a Wand of Wonder (risk of Clone or Heal).
        (5) Read some unidentified scroll/potion in hopes that it is a 
teleport scroll or healing potion.
        (6) Put on a teleport ring.  Teleport rings don't work instantly, but
you could put it on and hope it teleports you away -soon-.  You can even 
carry an uncursed teleport ring around for such circumstances.

===========================================================================

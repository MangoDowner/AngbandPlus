The Poet's Guide to First Steps
===============================

 Okay, folks. Here we go. Here are a few important things to keep in
 mind, organized by class, when you are first starting the game.

===========================================================================
Class advice:
===========================================================================

 Warriors
  
   A warrior lives to fight, right? Well, when you are deciding what
   stats to accept for a warrior, keep in mind that the things he needs
   the most are Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. A high Strength
   and high Dexterity are very important, because they govern how
   many swings a round you get with your weapon. More swings=big
   advantage. If you are using the Autoroller, try to get at least an 18/06
   score in each, and preferably more. Remember, the percentages in
   the Autoroller aren't independent, so don't set minimums for things
   like Intelligence, Wisdom, or even Charisma. You can improve them
   later.

   A light weapon makes a lousy digging tool, but you can get more hits
   with it if your stats are high enough. This makes the whip (1d6, 3
   pounds) one of the best weapons in the starting game. Remember,
   though, that getting three swings per round with your whip isn't
   necessarily better than getting two with a katana (3d4, 12 pounds).

   A good race for a warrior is the dwarf. Dwarves have high hit points
   and can't be blinded. Moreover, they have excellent infravision (50
   feet). Still, the disadvantages of the warrior class are the same ones
   as the dwarf race (for stats AND skills) so a gnome is also a good
   bet- they have free action and pretty good skills.

 Mages
 
   When choosing a mage, remember that the key attribute is
   Intelligence. It governs your failure rates on spells, and it also
   determines how much mana you get every level. The watershed
   score is 18/50, so if it's not too hard, try to get at least 18/56.
   Strength is probably the next most important consideration for
   mages, and it is their biggest weakness. If you can, get a Strength of
   10. For that matter, a Dexterity and Constitution of at least 10 would
   also be nice. Don't worry about Wisdom or Charisma.

   If you can get multiple hits per round with a whip, get one of those.
   Otherwise, get a weapon that has a big damage payload with a single
   hit, like a morning star or katana. Whatever you can afford.

   A good race for mages is the gnome. They have high Intelligence and
   free action. Unfortunately, they don't have many hit points. If you are
   playing Angband 2.8.1 or later, you could try playing a Dwarf mage
   (they cannot be blinded and have great hit points), but be prepared
   for a stiff challenge, because they can't get an Intelligence higher
   than 17. Humans and elves are also good choices.

 Rogues and Rangers
 
   Rogues and Rangers are both Mage/Fighter combination classes. The
   Ranger is, perhaps, a touch more powerful. Both of them need high
   Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, and Constitution, which means that
   your stats won't be all that great overall. Still, these classes have
   excellent skills, and can eventually learn how to use magic.

   For the Ranger, make sure that you buy lots of arrows. Keep your
   bows (long or short) for the whole game, discarding them only when
   you see a better. You get extra shots with normal bows at levels 20
   and 40.

   Any race is good for these classes, because they are the
   best-balanced in terms of skills. magic, and combat. If you want to
   have great skills, play a Hobbit Rogue. Of course, your fighting and
   hit points will suck...

 Priests

   Like the mage, the priest is primarily a spellcaster. Unlike the mage,
   the priest also knows which end of a mace to hold. Wisdom is the
   key attribute to a priest, as it governs the mana and failure rates for
   spells. Again, for the same reasons, try for an 18/56 if you can. The
   priest has no particular stat weakness, so just try for whatever you
   can get away with.

   Unfortunately, priests feel uncomfortable using edged weapons
   unless they have been blessed by the gods. They have penalties to hit,
   and a whopping spell failure penalty to contend with when they are
   wielding an inappropriate weapon. The mace isn't a bad weapon, but
   if you can get multiple hits with the whip, use it instead. If you can
   afford a Lucerne Hammer or a Morning Star, they are also better.

   Humans and dwarves make the best priests, in my estimation, but if
   you're going for 'fight over spell' then use the Half-Troll. You'll get
   more hit points and you'll be as good as anyone at casting spells by
   the end of the game.

 Paladins
 
   Much like the Ranger and Rogue, the Paladin is a Priest/Warrior
   combo class. That means that you want a high Strength, Wisdom,
   Dexterity, and Constitution. Don't try for a high Charisma, you'll
   probably get one anyway. Strength and Wisdom should probably be
   your main priorities.

   When it comes to equipment, the Paladin really got the shaft. You've
   got a broad sword (which is fine) but you need armour. Go and buy
   a good set. Paladins don't have any weapons restrictions, so get
   whatever you want.

   A good warrior race (like Human or Dunadan) is best for a Paladin.

Initial Equipment
===========================================================================

 Here's some general tips for buying equipment at the start of the
 game. First off, you have at least 100 gold. Hopefully more.

 Armour is vital if you're not a warrior. Warriors start off with an AC
 of at least 14 (chain mail). You need, at the least, an AC of 10 before
 you head into the dungeon, but if you don't have a Strength of 18 or
 so, then weight is an important consideration. Choose armours like
 Hard Leather Boots, which give good protection for a good price,
 and weigh next to nothing.

 Replace your crufty torches with a lantern and oil, if you can afford
 to. You get a larger light radius- great defense against paralyzers and
 sleeping monsters, especially if you don't have infravision or if it's
 useless 10 foot infravision. And, when all else fails, the flasks of oil
 are pretty good desperation weapons. Throw them at monsters.

 Scrolls of Phase Door and Potions of Cure Light Wounds can really
 save your bacon in an emergency. If you can't afford any in the
 beginning, then don't worry about it, but even in the end game I
 usually have about 30 scrolls of Phase Door unless I can throw away
 the mana like candy and cast the spell. Keep upgrading your potions.

 Most of the 'bonus items', like a Warrior's Potion of Berserk
 Strength, aren't that useful in the beginning. Unless it's a Potion of
 Healing, consider selling it.

 If you can afford it, a Long Bow and arrows are an excellent
 investment. They're light and powerful. Missile weapons, especially
 magical ones, are extremely deadly and great in combination with
 strategically-cast Phase Door spells.

 Look around for a bit for Farmer Maggot, but not too long. Unless
 you are a veteran player, then chances are your first level character
 will not be able to stand toe-to-toe with a Battle-Scarred Veteran and
 come out on top. If you're a Rogue or Ranger, you can afford to
 look around a bit longer, because of better Stealth, but remember not
 to let monsters cut you off from the staircase.

 Farmer Maggot often drops a magical item. If you've got the money,
 Identify it using the scroll of the same name. If it's a good base
 weapon type, consider wielding it. In any case, DON'T sell it until it's
 been Identified. If you're not going to wield it or sell it right away,
 leave it in your house so that it doesn't get stolen. If Maggot drops
 missiles, like bolts, and you really need the money, then sell one to
 find out how much it costs, and then sell the rest of them. It's like an
 Identify.

 If you need to build up cash before leaving town, then the Singing,
 Happy Drunk and the Aimless Looking Merchant are your best bet.
 Remember, your odds of defeating a Squint-Eyed Rogue aren't much
 better than 70-30, and your odds against a Mean-Looking Merc or a
 Battle-Scarred Vet are considerably worse. Run.

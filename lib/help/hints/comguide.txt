===========================================================================
1) Monster Rooms / Monster Pits 
===========================================================================

      Most monster rooms can be approached from the side or behind
      (behind meaning 'near the wall opposite the wall with the door').
      But if you are forced to approach the room via the entrance side,
      then here is one method: 

      Monsters have a limited detection range - roughly 15 spaces.
      Assume it is. The basic strategy is this. Come within 15 spaces of
      the door. take one step forward, and 5 steps back. Then, only the
      closest few monsters noticed your presence, and they will come
      out of the room, and attack you. You can dispose of them, and then
      come back to wake up the next closest ones. 

      Jelly pits 
            Probably safest to leave them alone. They can eat through
            armor, and are worth little experience. Very easy to take
            out if you have resist acid armor, though. (hide your
            weapons first) 

      Orc/Troll pits 
            (1) Rod of Light / Spear of Light is a good way to do lots
            of damage to many orcs at once. 
            (2) Sleep III can be used to put almost all the orcs to sleep
            at once. (multiple casts might be necessary). You can then
            take out row by row via light damage in (1). Most trolls are
            immune to sleep, but a few are not (e.g. I think Forest
            Trolls aren't), so while you can't do this for a whole pit,
            the sleep trick (see below) will work if you do it right. 

      Priest trick 
            Orc, troll, and giant pits (and, at higher levels, demon and
            dragon pits) are among the best of priest's friends, once
            they get: i) Dispel Evil (from either Exorcisms and
            Dispelling or Wrath of God) ii) Some form of speed (temp.
            or permanent), iii) Protection from Evil. 

            a) Find a pit, by casting Detect Evil. Get as close to it as
            you can. Cast Protection from Evil a couple of times. If
            you can get to the door, great, go to step c) below and open
            it. Otherwise, try to work your way to part of the pit's
            wall. 

            b) Make a hole in the wall (dig or Stone to Mud). A
            monster will probably block the hole, unless you hasted
            yourself first and were able to time it right. 

            c) Using your speed (temporary or permanent), kill the
            monster in the hole/doorway, or perhaps just teleport it
            away. Step into the hole with your haste to see all the
            monsters in the room. 

            d) Cast Dispel Evil repeatedly. The Protection from Evil
            will reduce or stop melee attacks. This should allow you to
            easily kill almost all of the monsters. (you might have to go
            in and clean up). 

      If you have only speed 1, or can't get close enough to dig a hole, but
      do have Ethereal Openings, do this: 

            Kill or (better) teleport away about 1/3 to 1/2 of the
            monsters first. Teleport away is best since it removes more
            monsters at a time. Then you can use Blink to try to get
            into the pit. Once inside, you can dispell at will. Note that
            you will want to cast Protection from Evil before Blinking
            around, and that the killing/teleport steps are required to
            free up some space in the pit. This will probably take
            several tries, but it is worth it. 

      At high levels, Demon and Dragon pits can be handled the same
      way. You should prepare by having the appropriate resistance.
      MultiHued Dragons just do too much damage compared to the
      others, and you might want to take them on one by one. It is
      probably not worth the bother of trying to take out a multihued
      pit. 

      This is NOT a good technique to use against graveyards (undead
      pits)! You can easily die if several drujs decide to cast nasty spells
      at you at once. 

      Undead pits are hard, but kind of fun. Don't try them without
      some way to get to speed 3, some form of Hold Life or Nether
      Resistance, Free Action, and lots of heal items. A Helm of
      Telepathy or some other source of ESP is also very helpful. A good
      general procedure: a) kill all the monsters that phase through walls.
      They'll be the first to escape. Then kill b) the others (wraiths,
      wights, skeletons, vampires, etc.) One or two at a time -- lure them
      'round a corner. Really nasty guys like Black Reavers,
      Nightcrawlers, etc. should probably be teleported away and fought
      elsewhere. Finally, when all of the mobile guys are dead, c) kill the
      drujs (they don't move). The ball-against-the-wall works, as does a
      direct target through a hole, but try to avoid being in their line of
      sight unless you have at least speed 3. Also try not to let more than
      one or two see you at any given time. 

      Note that Black Reavers can "eat" walls, so when fighting an
      undead pit be *very* careful not to walk near any such holes and
      into the line of sight of the drujs before you're ready to go after the
      drujs. 

      Undead pits can be so dangerous as to make it worth your while to
      avoid them. Think (and prepare) very carefully before even
      thinking of taking one on. 

===========================================================================
2) Vaults
===========================================================================

      Lesser vaults. These are things like the round rooms, "inner
      rooms" with oddly-shaped inner rooms, and (probably the most
      common) the squarish rooms with two large diagonal walls. These
      contain good treasures and monsters, but usually they are not
      wildly out of depth -- i.e., the monsters are created as normal for
      the level, although the large concentration of monsters makes the
      odds of finding a fairly nasty one (or three :-) quite good. 

      Greater vaults. These are the huge rooms that fill half the screen
      and contain lots of very good objects and lots of out-of-depth
      monsters. Many of these are deliberately created out of depth. 

      Incredible vaults. This is a subset of b). It's the "graph paper"
      room of crypts with one monster+treasure per crypt. These make
      type b) vaults seem like a piece of cake. Unless you've killed most
      of the uniques -- unlikely except near the very end -- expect to find
      LOTS of uniques, at least 6 or 8, with essentially no restriction on
      level. The treasure is equally incredible. I guess that about half of
      them contain at least one artifact when they're created. 

      One of the simplest ways to deal with these rooms is by using a
      wand of teleport monster to get rid of the really tough ones.
      However, a really tough monster would probably be faster than
      you are, which means they could also breathe on you the same turn
      you dig through the wall. You have been warned. These rooms are
      -very- dangerous. 

      The simplest way by far to deal with these rooms is to avoid them.
      Much better to be alive and without _ANY_ artifact than dead. 

      To give you an idea of how dangerous, the source code states that
      monster in these rooms can be up to -40- levels out of depth.
      That's 2000 feet! 

===========================================================================
3) Uniques 
===========================================================================

      By far the best way to deal with most of the uniques is the pillar
      trick. Indeed, this is so effective I think it's a bit unbalancing.
      Fighting Tiamat at speed 3 in an open space is difficult. Fighting
      Tiamat at speed 4 by chasing her around a pillar turns out to be
      pathetic. Perhaps this should be reworked. 

      At higher levels, when you have multiple attacks, big plusses to
      damage and possibly some other advantanges, just beating on the
      monster can be effective. But not all uniques are killed by these two
      approaches: 

      In the early going, I don't think there's a single unique other than
      Farmer Maggot who a player who's slightly aggressive will be able
      to beat by just whaling on. I subscribe to the pummel them and
      then retreat (phase door, teleport, whatever) rest and hit again - it
      takes longer since uniques regenerate quickly, but it's much more
      successful. At high levels, just straight forward pummeling works
      much better - that's what my 45th level priest does. And I've yet to
      use the pillar trick on _any_ unique. Again, if you drop levels at
      any sort of a decent rate, you're rarely going to have speed
      advantage on the uniques. Everything else, yes, but I can only get
      temporarily faster than uniques, and that's not enough for the pillar
      trick. I'm usually the same speed or, if anything, slower.

===========================================================================
4) Rough Monsters 
===========================================================================

      An emperor lich has 1520 hit points, plus anything additional that
      it gains by draining mana (6 points per mana point drained) and
      charges (40 points per charge). Never let it attack you in melee,
      because it can destroy your wands, healing itself in the process, as
      well as draining your experience and dexterity. 

      If you can get to speed 3, faster than the lich, it is easy to kill; just
      fight, move back, fight, move back, and so on. You will still need a
      lot of cure wounds potions, unless you let it chase you around a
      pillar, as in the AMHD technique. 

      Note (for people familiar with Moria) that an emperor lich is
      (relatively) less nasty than in Moria. 

    Invisibles 

      One tactic, which is dangerous but still worth thinking about is
      fighting an invisible creature and a group of monsters at the same
      time. Since only one monster can be in a position at a time,
      suspicious 'gaps' in the middle of groups of monsters can show you
      where these annoying pests are. 

    Gain Stat Levels

      1500 - 1600 feet - the other stats besides Charisma. Charisma
      potions aren't particularly necessary, and are cheap, so don't hang
      around 1000 feet merely for Charisma. 1500 are physical stat
      potions - STR, DEX, CON 1600 are mental stat potions - INT,
      WIS 

      At 2000 or so there are Augmentation potions, but it's a pretty
      rough jungle down there. 

===========================================================================
5) Useful tricks 
===========================================================================

  Useful Trick #1 - Running in a circle

      Find an area with a relatively small path that goes in a circle. The
      path should be smaller than 1/3 of the screen (like one of those large
      room in a room rooms). If you are fighting, you can run in a circle,
      and they will happily chase after you, and your hit points and
      mana will slowly creep up. You can then beat on whoever, and
      start running again. This doesn't work if the monster is faster than
      you are, or can do damage from a distance. 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Useful Trick #2 - The pillar trick

      Find a monster slower than you are. Find or make a pillar. A pillar
      would be a single block of wall with one open space on all four
      sides. When the monster is right next to you, hit the monster. Then
      next turn, move to the other side of the wall. The monster will
      follow you. Hit the monster. Move to the other side of the wall.
      Continue till the monster is dead. This doesn't work with two
      monsters at once, btw. 

      Example of pillar:

         ... 
         .#.
         ...

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Useful Trick #3 - taking advantage of stupid monsters

      Monsters always attempt to take the straight path towards you.
      So, if there is a wall between you, the monsters won't move, cuz
      they're trying to move straight towards you (towards the wall).
      This makes it easy to take out a group of monsters. 

      An example is best. Let's say you're fighting a bunch of Ogres. 

         OOOOOOOOO 
         ##############'### 
             @ 

      The O's will stay right where they are, since they're all trying to
      stay as close to you as they can. Notice the door off to the right. If
      you walk towards the door, you will reach this point: 

               OOOOOOOO 
         ##############O### 
                  @ 

      Where one ogre has gone far enough right to go through the door.
      Now go left again: 

            OOOOOOOO 
         ##############'### 
               @   O 

      The one ogre that made it through the door will follow you, the rest
      will stay on their side (duh). You can take out that single ogre, and
      repeat as many times as you want. You can vary this a bit, and let
      two ogres 'out' if you can take on two at a time with no problem. 

      The only annoying thing with this method is that the dead
      monsters tend to leave a lot of treasure you need to clean up, to
      give the other monsters a chance to drop treasure too, but it's a
      good safe method. Works really well with telepathy, too. 

      Subnote: corridors like this make phase door a lot safer, since if you
      end up on the other side of the wall, you're (usually) completely
      safe, unless the other monster can go through walls or something. 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Useful Trick #4 - The sleep spell in the corridor trick

      A sleep monster wand or "Sleep I" spell is required for this tactic
      effective against group monsters. It has been used to deadly effect
      against orc pits and troll pits, but is handy before then at times: 

          In a room:         In a corridor: 

         ####+### # #      ################# 
         #  oooo### #        ppppppppxppp@ # 
         # ooxooo @ #      ############### # 
         #  oooo#####                    # # 
         ######## 

      These represent some typical situations. In either case you sleep
      the first creature in the corridor. You then cast a ball spell (or use a
      wand of stinking cloud/frost ball/...) over their head and past by
      three or more spaces (at least to the 'x' marked in each case). This
      prevents the damage spell waking up the slept creature. If you run
      out of mana, duck around the corner to rest. Periodically the slept
      creature will awaken, so you may need to sleep it again. 

      If you don't have ball spells, you can always just beat on the first
      guy, and then sleep the 2nd, rest, then beat... etc. 

      You can often destroy large numbers of creatures with little risk
      this way. 

      If you have lots of hit points, the sleep spell itself may be
      unnecessary. Just let the one creature hit you - but then you don't
      need to be careful not to wake the front guy up either. You can
      always sleep the first creature and rest. 

      Note - for monsters that shoot some sort of missile/ball weapon
      (like rangers or dragons), you need to do it so only the first creature
      can see you - 

         #p# 
         #p# 
         #p# 
         #p# 
         #p########## 
         # @ 
         ############ 

      If you stood in the corner, the creatures behind the slept monster
      would shoot some weapon, which would wake up that monster,
      and screw it all up. 

      variation : using a Rune of Protection to block the first monster. 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Useful Trick # 5 - The easy way to kill any non-moving creature 

      To start, a little background info. Playing around with the targeting
      option in Angband (e.g. PC version 1.31 and later) I noticed that I
      could aim for a particular spot on the floor. Ball type spells affect
      an area, not just that spot on the floor. Now, if you cant see the
      monster, but you can target a spot next to the monster, the ball
      spell's area of effect will encompass the little sucker, and damage it.
      I'll show you a pretty usual setup. 

         ########################## 
         #........................# 
         #.######################.# 
         #.#                    #.# 
         #.#                    #.# 
         #.#   s. <-target that #.# 
         #.,        dot!!       #.# 
         #.#                    #.# 
         #.##### ################.# 
         #........................# 
         ####### ################## 
               # # 
               # # 
               # # 
               #@# <- You are here. # # 

      Now, through experience, Korash the Dwarven Priest (who is my
      alter personality!) knows where the Druj is (detect monster) and he
      knows that the monster can't see him! But, he also knows that by
      targeting the spot marked, Orb of Draining or whatever you choose
      to use will hit the Druj!. This way, you can kill them off, your
      mana will recover quicker than its hitpoints. And for a high level
      character the Druj dies while you still have some mana left. I know
      that for Korash, about 10-15 Orb of Draining shots and a Hand or
      Eye Druj is dead. That works out to be about 70-100 mana. A bit ..
      but not too much. 

      This of course, require detection, ball spells, and likely a digging
      tool to make the tunnel to shoot through, so might not be easy for
      the warrior types to use. 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Useful Trick #6 - The Close the door trick 

      When low on hit points and being pursued, you can't always set up
      the 'go round in a circle' trick, but wandering around can be
      dangerous. 

      Here is the alternative to the 'run in a circle' trick: 

         ########## 
              ooo 
         ####'##### 
            #@# 

      If you can get 1 space ahead of your pursuer(s), and on the other
      side of a door, then close it. Yes, the pursuer is just going to open it
      again, so you don't seem to have gained much - but you have - you
      have gained one free turn of rest. Close it again...and again. Soon
      you'll see your hp (and mana if you have it) going up. 

      If they don't open it for a turn, you have to decide whether to steal
      the extra breathing space by running, or wait. In the arrangement
      above, if the front orc moves left at some stage, they will have a
      chance of getting through after you. Some other arrangements are
      safer, like this one: 

            ### 
         #### 
           o'@ 
         #### 
            ### 

      Note: This won't work at all against monsters that are faster than
      you are. 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Useful Trick #7 - Keeping a tight lid on possible explosions

      If you ever encounter a swarm of exploding somethings that you
      can't kill, one simple way to take care of it is to simply close a few
      doors, and lock them in a room. Since they can't multiply outside of
      this room, you can leave. This works well for Giant Fleas that run
      rampant, too. 

                 ################## 
                 #w ww ww w w w w 
         #########w ww ww wwww 
         .......@+www ww ww w www 
         ######### wwww ww www w 
                 #w w w w 
                 ################## 

      In addition, this is an easy way to get easy experience at early
      levels. Since worms are easy to kill, they are easy experience. You
      can let worms multiply, and then open the door, kill a few, and
      then close the door at little to no risk. 

      Be sure not to lock yourself in a dead end - trying to run through a
      room of white worms can kill a character quite easily. 

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Useful Trick #8 - Death by Rune of Protection

      Runes of Protection are portable walls (almost). If you have Rune
      of Protection scrolls (or the Glyph of Warding prayer), you can set
      up a configuration like this: 

                 # # 
                 # # 
         #########N# 
         ....@...^^# 
         ########### 

      where N is a generic Nasty and the ^'s are Runes. 

      First, you place Runes in a corner as shown. Then, you find some
      way to lure N into the corner. Perhaps tossing a spell at it, then
      running away. Even better, ironically, is an item of Aggravate
      Monster, because then you can cause a distant monster to wake up,
      start pursuing you, and walk right into the corner. Remember to
      take the damn thing OFF after a couple of turns (unless it's
      Deathwreaker/Zarcuthra/The One Ring...). 

      Here, in this setup, N: a) cannot cast spells/breaths. It can't see
      you. b) is pinned between a rock (its move algorithm that tries to
      move it towards you) and a hard place (the Runes). 

      In other words, it's stuck. So just use the splash-the-ball-spell-
      off-the-wall trick, previously described, to kill it. This is a natural
      for priests, as they have the Glyph/Orb combo.; other classes will
      have to scrape around for the Rune of Protection scrolls. 

      **BIG CAVEAT** Remember that Runes can break! There is a
      LEVEL/550 chance (LEVEL is the monster's level; the 550 is
      specified in CONSTANTS.H in the source) that a monster can
      break a Rune on any given move. If either rune, especially the one
      nearest you, breaks, then you may want to leave. Thus, you
      shouldn't use this technique unless you (a) have a good escape
      spell/item and (b) can handle one attack of whatever the monster
      can throw at you. Note that this is not a good thing to use against
      high-level, high-speed monsters. . .

  Useful Trick #9 - Dealing with monsters that summon 

      This is restricted to relatively high-level characters. 

      Monsters that summon - quylthulgs, many higher-level uniques, etc
      - summon monsters in spaces adjacent to you. As a result, if these
      spaces are already filled, the summoner can't summon any more. If
      summoning is the monster's main attack, as with Quylthulgs, then
      you can wait for the summoner to summon ONCE, then target the
      summoner and toss ball spells at it. You need ball spells or
      wands/rods to do this, since the summoned monsters will block
      bolts, and prevent melee attacks against the summoner. A gnome
      priest winner killed Qlzqqlzuup this way - its only spells are
      summons, and so he simply Orbed it to death. 

      Of course, this only works if the first summon gives relatively
      harmless monsters. Ant, reptile, spider, and hound summons often
      give relatively easy to deal with monsters, especially if you have
      lots of resistances and a reasonable way to heal yourself. In any
      event, eyeball the summoned critters before plunging in. If you find
      yourself surrounded by Chaos Hounds or Greater Undead, it's a
      good time to teleport out and try again later. 

      Alternatively just teleport them away as soon as you seem them!
      (targetting is useful here). I killed one of the unique Q's when it was
      in a large pit: 

         ########### 
         # @ 
         ########### 
         #Q 
         ########### 

      Dug diagonally then orb of drained it to death. These pits are nice
      for killing monsters that summon since you can also just telport
      them away with one spell..only problem is they have limited space
      to drop items.

  Useful trick #10 - Using an immobile/weak monster as armor 

      Heal monster allows you to hit a fairly weak creature with an area
      effect rod or spell without killing that creature. This is handy when
      there is a much more dangerous monster behind the weaker one.

      For example: You are in a hallway with a brown mold and a ninja.
      The mold is two spaces to your right. The ninja is behind the mold,
      three spaces to your right. You can cast heal monster on the mold a
      few times, then hit the mold with fireballs from your rod until the
      adjacent ninja dies. This tactic is, of course, not always useful.
      Spellcasting and breathing monsters will ignore your barricade.
      Harmless monsters do not always appear when needed (though
      they can be encouraged with speed monster). Your blocking
      monster may die on you, if you aren't careful. Also, you need a
      reusable area-effect attack. 

      Haste monster can be used on a relatively weak monster so as to
      block a much nastier creature. Here's an example: You are in a room
      with a kobold and a night mare. By casting Haste Monster on the
      kobold two or three times, you may (depending on their locations)
      be able to get the kobold, rather than the night mare, next to you
      when you run from the room. 

         ########### 
         #  q      # 
         #       k # 
         #         # 
         #####@##### 
             # # 
             # # 

      This buys you time to run up some stairs or get some mana back. If
      you have a rod of light, you can blast the night mare repeatedly,
      without needing to face its attack. Slow Monster can be used if the
      kobold is doing significant damage. There are many limitations on
      this tactic. Breathing and spell-casting monsters are best dealt with
      in other ways. You need a conveniently placed wimpy monster.
      And you do, of course, end up with a kobold on your trail.

6) More techniques for killing monsters
===========================================================================
      
Pillardancing.
  Requires that you be at least twice as fast as the monster you
  are fighting. Find a single block of wall, freestanding, and lure
  your enemy to it. When both you and your eneny are standing
  next to the pillar, hit him, and then move so that you are
  opposite the pillar from him. He will use his turn to move so that
  he's standing next to you. Hit him again, and then move again.
  Repeat until he's dead. 

  Note that some monsters move eratically, and cannot be relied
  upon to move in the method expected. Also, some monsters
  (mostly Ghosts) can move through walls, and a small number
  of monsters can chew through walls. 

Shoot'n Scoot.
  Requires a large room, Phase Door, and some type of missile
  weapon. Stand at one end of the room, your enemy at the other.
  Fire your missile weapon at him until he gets close, and then
  Phase Door. Fire again, until he gets close, and repeat. By the
  time you run out of ammunition, he should be dead or weak
  enough for you to finish him HTH (Hand to Hand). 

Hack'n Back.
  Requires that you be at least twice as fast as your opponent.
  Stand next to your enemy, hit him, and back up. He should use
  his turn to move towards you instead of using a missile weapon
  or a spell. Hit him again, back up again, repeat. This is a little
  more dangerous than Pillardancing, because the monster gets a
  chance to breathe or cast a spell, but it's easier to set up. 

Wail'n Bail.
  Requires Teleport items. Fight the monster until you're almost
  dead, teleport out, find him, and resume fighting. This is
  dangerous, because you could teleport right next to some nasty
  that will kill you. Also, it is not generally useful for killing unique
  monsters, as they regenerate damage very quickly, and by the
  time you find them again, they will have healed what you did to
  them. 

The Anti-Summoning Corridor.
  Requires a little time to set up. This can be done just about
  anywhere. Dig a twisting corridor into the rock, and station
  yourself at one end of it. When your opponent arrives, he won't
  be able to summon any monsters next to you. This is a very
  important technique for fighting many higher-end monsters
  which very quickly bring in a horde of other monsters.

=========================================================================

1) Everybody

   for all characters:

      Watch your hit points. Don't let them get too low. Rest as soon as
      possible after every fight, to get your hit points and mana (if any) to
      maximum. You have nothing to gain by running around with your
      guns half loaded. If you need more convincing, try counting the
      number of times you've survived with zero hit points, or cast your
      last spell with just enough mana. It shouldn't happen, but it does.

      Also, missile weapons (aka bows/crossbows) are a pain, take a lot of
      inventory space, and are heavy (including ammo), but they are also
      very devastating weapons that can dish out a -lot- of damage. They
      are very handy. Also, you can use flasks of oil as relatively cheap
      and effective missile weapons.

    for Spellcasters:

      Don't take every spell the moment you are allowed to. If you 'G' to
      learn a spell and there is nothing you really need right now, press
      <Esc>. You can learn an extra one later. If you get in a spot, and need
      a spell you might have learned but didn't, it only costs a turn to learn
      - you have a lot more flexibility if you have an unlearned spell or two
      up your sleeve. Sometimes you have more than one spell you would
      like to learn at once - if you 'save up' a couple, you can get them all
      right away. It is also handy to have a couple spare for when you find
      the special books - e.g. Resistance of Scarabtarices as they have some
      handy lower level spells. 

      If you are a mage with 18/50 or higher Intelligence, you may be
      better off learning the spells and getting the experience for casting
      them while still at low levels. Even for a character like this, however,
      getting all three 7th level mage spells at 7th level might be
      worthwhile for survivability.

    for pseudo spellcasters - (rangers/rogues/paladins)

      Until you are VERY high level, do NOT rely on your magic to get
      you out of tight spots, since their failure rate will be too high for
      emergency usage, and you won't have enough mana to really cast
      them more than once.

=============================================================================

2) Warriors

      Warriors get through the early levels easily, and make a good choice
      if you want to learn the game. This will be frustrating until you get a
      good intuition of where hidden doors are, so your first character
      should be a Ranger.

      If you are trying to go as a Warrior, then Half-trolls, Dunedain or
      High-elves are good choices...You can almost guarantee a STR >
      18/50 with one of these, and the last two can give you a DEX >
      18/50 with luck, thus giving you TWO swings with that broadsword
      at the start of the game. This extra advantage makes up for the slow
      advancment of the last two races. 

      A High Elf warrior with 18/57 Str and 18/50 Dex can get _four_ hits
      with a 5lb weapon. 

      A Human warrior goes up levels _fast_. Take a high dex and strength
      for multiple hits with light weapons.

      Enchant your weapon as quickly as you can and look for rings of
      damage or slaying, etc.

      Also, look for high CON (no less than 14), and not too low WIS or
      INT (you will need to use wands and staffs)...Furthermore, these
      last two will help your pseudo-ID work faster.

    General hints for warriors

      Really easy - Go in and kill. Rest after every battle (if necessary).
      You *should* be able to get down to 200' on the first trip without
      problems (assuming no out of place monsters), but returning to town
      may be tough. A possibility is to start with two complete trips to
      100', collecting everything, digging out all treasure. By this time, The
      character is around 5-6th level...all depends on what you find.

      Most Warriors should have multiple hits (often a lighter weapon can
      do more damage *per turn* than a heavy one, if it gets more hits).
      Watch for anything to increase your damage. A Strength of 18 gives
      you +3 immediately. Enchant-to-Dam scrolls can take your damage
      up further and are readily available. Watch carefully for rings of
      damage, rings of slaying, gloves of slaying, etc (I once got all 3, and a
      total of +33 to damage for each of three hits before going down as far
      as Wormtongue!). Even a total of +10 to damage (when counted
      three or four times) makes most uniques on the low levels easy.
      Jellies usually don't get a hit in.

      Use the Warriors' pseudo-ID all the time. After the first few levels,
      drop any weapon or armor that you don't need that gives you a
      Average or Cursed id. NOTE that if the p-ID message says "You feel
      that [ ] is terrible." then this is a SPECIAL cursed item, possibly a
      cursed artifact. KEEP THIS until you have complete ID. 

      Collect all wands that are beneficial to you. After 500', start carrying
      a ranged weapon with you. Remember that you are the worst class at
      high levels...always have a WoR and some ability to ID items (Staff
      of Perceptions) at these deep levels.

      DO keep magic items onhand--but you should prefer the more
      obvious Scrolls and Potions---since these can't fail due to low Int (I
      think). Useful Rods are Recall, Illumination, and Restoration. These
      may (and probably will) fail a lot, but use them when in a "bare" area
      cleared out by yourself (of monsters).

      DO get a bow/arrow quickly---this is your ONLY reliable distance
      attack, and you'll NEED it against acid-breathers/spitters (e.g. Green
      Naga/Worm). Actually, a crossbow (especially a heavy crossbow) is
      probably more reliable.

=============================================================================

3) Mages

      High-elves make good Mages. They generally have better abilities,
      and a high stealth. Starting attributes: 18/80 intelligence, and 10
      strength. Less than 10 strength really puts a limit on what you can
      carry. With a 18/80 intelligence, a single ring of intelligence (+1) can
      put you into the big bonus mana region.

      Gnome mages are really good too, since they can still get the highest
      starting mana ratio with 18/70 intelligence, and best of all, have
      innate free action.

    General Hints for Mages

      In general, keep your mana up. Don't run out of mana.

      Cast Detect Monster and Find Hidden Traps/Doors everytime you
      sneeze. Turning on the 'stop between screens' option guarantees that
      you don't walk into any offscreen traps, if you cast detect traps as
      soon as the screen changes. It is pretty safe to disable that option to
      speed gameplay, but it is recommended to avoid Murphy's Law and
      re-enable it if you are on a special level, lest you be running down
      some corridor and fall into an offscreen trap door. Avoid or prepare
      for large groups of monsters.

      Learn escape spells as soon as possible. (i.e. Phase Door and
      Teleport) Learn to use them efficiently. 

      Stinking cloud is a very handy spell. Fantastic for taking out flies or
      fleas. It is a pretty powerful early spell, and it's a ball spell, so you
      can do very handy things with it. You may do more raw damage with
      Lightning bolt (which has the -highest- damage/mana ratio of almost
      all the spells) but can only affect one at a time, and you can't shoot
      -over- anything with a bolt spell.

      Also, learn to use Sleep and Spear of Light, as mentioned in various
      parts of this document. They are very useful relatively low level
      spells.

=============================================================================

4) Priests

      Priests are somewhat easier because of their heal spells (especially
      the 200hp and the full heal). By healing 200 hp whenever you lose
      this many you are less likely to die from any big breath attack (cf.
      mage with potions thinking how much can so and so breath for if I
      have this, this and that?). A priest can get a lot of heals out of
      one lot of mana! 

      Suggestion 1: Play a dwarf priest with 18/50 wisdom, other stats
      don't really matter - go for a decent strength and/or con. You could
      also try a Dunadan with similar stats.

      Suggestion 2: Play a Half-Troll priest. Seriously. Those extra hit
      points come in -handy-. Try either: a) 18/12 Str, 14 Wis, 10 Dex, 18
      Con and wield a whip (2 hits - double the plus!); b) 18 Wis and 18
      Con and wield the heaviest damage weapon you can use; or c) 18/??
      Str and 18 Wis.

      In either case play the early levels like a (weak!) warrior. 

    General Hints for Priests

      If you've played Moria before, the first 9 or so levels of the priestly
      life in Angband play very similarly.

      Many of the same rules for mages apply. Watch your mana. Cast
      Detect prayers, especially Evil and Traps, whenever the screen
      changes. These prayers cost a fair amount of mana, compared to the
      mage spells, (Detect Doors and Detect Traps are two different
      prayers, for one thing), and so you will want to take it fairly slowly.

      At low levels, melee bites, even though your mace is much better
      than a mage's dagger. Be prepared to phase door around a lot.

      Don't count on Cure Light Wounds to work, especially below level
      10. Carry a few potions of same at all times. You can't cast Cure
      Light Wounds while you are blind - but you can quaff the potion. Of
      course, if you can retreat to a safe spot, Cure Light Wounds is a good
      prayer. Once you get above level 10 or so, you can reasonably cast it
      "on the fly", so to speak, but still be careful.

      Aside from the Detect and Cure prayers, most of the low level
      prayers are pretty useless. Create Food and Portal are notable
      exceptions. Basically, below level 9 you will be playing like a
      warrior, but a damn wimpy one. Don't overexert yourself. At level 9
      you can get... Orb of Draining! Then life becomes much easier.

      When you get to level 7, *stop* taking prayers when you gain levels.
      [If you have 18/50 Wisdom you can stop at level 8.] You want to do
      this because you can "force" your gods to give you Orb of Draining.
      You want this prayer. Badly. It does 3d6 plus your level damage,
      double to evil (which is good), is a ball spell (very good), and (best of
      all) there are no monsters that resist it, unlike with the mage spells. 

      Here's how:

      1) Get a copy of Chants and Blessings, the prayer book with OoD in
      it.

      2) When you get to level 9, do the following:

      a) Go up to town and drop all your copies of the first two books
      (Beginners' and Words of Wisdom) in your home. You could do this
      in the dungeon, but this way they won't get stolen or inadvertently
      lost.

      b) Take your copy of Chants and Blessings.

      c) Hit 'G'. Voila! You should now have all three 9th-level spells:
      Neutralize Poison, Orb of Draining and Cure Serious Wounds.

      Use Detect Evil to find hidden Ghosts (its only advantage is that it
      DOES detect invisible critters), and if you're not high enough level,
      RUN AWAY (some low-level ghosts drain Wisdom). 

      To save ID scrolls, use the priest's ID, Remove Curse. Try on any
      armor, rings, or amulets you find lying around. If they're cursed, you
      can de-curse them and drop them, thus keeping you from burning ID
      scrolls on useless stuff. Note that priests eventually get Identify as a
      prayer, but it's in Godly Insights, which is pretty rare above 2000'.

      Caveats. 

      1) Don't try this with weapons. Morgul weapons cannot be
      uncursed with the standard grade Remove Curse. In most current
      versions of Angband, reading a scroll of enchant to-hit or to-dam will
      zap any curse on a weapon, allowing you to take it off. This at least
      allows you to get rid of it. However, this seems to be a bug, and it
      may be removed from later ports or versions. 

      2) Wait a few levels after getting Remove Curse before using this.
      That way, if you have a high WIS, allowing you to gain more than
      one prayer/level, and you put on an Iron Helm of Wisdom (-5) or
      something, you won't lose the Remove Curse prayer when your WIS
      plummets...

      In theory, one could get the One Ring of Power, which cannot be
      de-cursed by any means, this way. However, this is so unlikely at
      pre-Godly-Insights levels that I've neglected that possibility. [Some
      people think that the One Ring could be very useful back then....]

      The very high level prayer Elemental Brand can be used to make
      very deadly bolts/arrows by wielding the bolts and branding them. 

=============================================================================

5) Rogues

      Rogues are among the best fighters and are experts at the Art of Not
      Being Seen. If the monster doesn't see you (/wake up), it won't hit
      you.

      Suggestion 1: Hobbit Rogue. Infravision is very nice and you can
      sneak around well. Monsters often won't even notice you until you
      tap them with your sword (very hard of course). Also, being able to
      disarm traps and locked doors is handy. 

      Suggestion 2: Half-Orc Rogue. This is really a totally different
      character than the Hobbit Burglar: a Half-Orc Rogue has lower
      Stealth, but good fighting, and some limited spellcasting. In a way,
      the character is a bit more like a Warrior with some spellcasting
      ability.

    General Hints for Rogues

      There are two kinds of rogues, the tough rogues (like a Half-Orc) and
      the sneaky rogues (like a Hobbit). The 'standard' rogue is the 'sneak'.
      They are often able to walk right through a room without waking
      things up. Rogues get some good detection spells (but essentially no
      offensive spells), and combined with the ability not to be noticed,
      they can often avoid damage. If you see something nasty when you
      peek in a room, you can often quietly close the door without waking
      it up. 

      If you do fight, try to do it from a distance when you can.

      Rogues can also fight well in the conventional sense. You will want
      to use the spell Detect Traps heavily, and probably won't need to
      use many other spells all that much (until you get Identify and
      Recharge spells).

      The 'tough' Rogues are essentially played like Warriors in the early
      levels, but later they get some helpful spells as well.

      Play these guys a bit more cautiously than a Warrior. Be sure to have
      a starting Dex of 18/50 (AT LEAST) and a starting Int of 18 (so you
      can cast more of your key spells). Also, beware of FUN group
      monsters---use the Mage strategy at high levels---you need to rely
      HIGHLY on your Stealth and a few scrolls of Teleport to get you
      out of messy situations, since your spells aren't that reliable for quite
      awhile. Halflings tend to make superb Rogues---the Rogue abilities
      compliment the Halfling's ones beautifully (also Halflings get Dex
      sustained---a Rogue's prime stat).

      Also, gain the spells soon---and cast Detect Treasure/Objects on
      every screen. These two lovely spells will let you find the treasures
      buried on levels (MASSIVE amounts of cash you can dig up when
      you get a nice Pick). Use these detection spells A LOT, since they
      give you the subtle edge in combat. Also, you should get a Bow as
      soon as possible---as with Rangers, you're excellent with Bows, and
      you should be using Bows as your distance attack.

=============================================================================

6) Rangers 

      Rangers have good bow skill, and have reasonable magic device,
      disarm, etc, and fight better than mages and priests. They get all but
      the most powerful magic spells. Because they are reasonably
      effective fighters, they gain levels more quickly than mages early on
      (mages need to run away more often). They make an excellent
      compromise between the early might of the warrior, and later power
      of a mage. Rangers should take advantage of their missile weapon
      skill.

      Suggestion 1: High Elf Ranger. This is one of the slowest characters
      to advance, but See Invisible, combined with high Str, Int, Dex make
      their survival during early levels very good. Try: a) Str 18/02 Int
      18/50 Dex 18/01, which makes a more 'mage-like' Ranger, for 2 x
      mana and 2 hits with a Sabre (18/10 for 2 hits with a Trident); b) Str
      18/32 Int 18 Dex 18/01, for a ranger that fights better - 1.5 x mana
      and 3 hits with a Sabre. If you are a little more patient you may be
      able to get both the higher Str and Int.

      Suggestion 2: Human Ranger. This is a much faster character, and
      you'll have spells by the time you finish your first trip down. Try:
      Str 18/12, Int 18, Dex 10. Two hits with a Sabre, and 1.5 x mana
      make quite a powerful character.

    General Hints for Rangers

      Play a Ranger like a warrior at the start, but don't forget you are
      weaker - stand back and use your good bow skill more. Keep plenty
      of Phase Door scrolls and Cure Light Wounds potions handy, and
      Flasks of Oil are especially useful until level 3 or 4. You won't need
      oil as a weapon after that.

      DO get some enchant-weapon scrolls and make your Bow more
      deadly---that should be first thing to buy after the first major trip
      down (around level 5 or so), since Rangers are excellent with
      Bows/Arrows they should rely on THESE for the primary
      effects---their magic isn't as powerful as a Mage, and hardly
      ANYTHING can resist a missile attack outright. 

      Keep your mana up. Use spells to complement your fighting ability
      - for example, cast a Magic Missile or two before closing for the final
      blows. If you time it right, the opponent will be killed by your first
      turn (so you often won't get hit by weaker creatures). This way you
      don't have to swap weapons like you do with a missile weapon.

      At later levels you start getting some really good spells. However,
      you don't get identify and recharge until _much_ later than a mage, so
      you need to carry scrolls and staves for longer, and you only get the
      weaker pseudo-ID, and it is very slow, so more cleverness is needed.
      Don't ID everything the second you get it. Pseudo ID might still kick
      in. Wait until you have to drop something. Don't ID something
      underground just to find out its charges if you aren't about to drop it
      - that can wait for the town. If you are careful, a single Staff of
      Perceptions and just a few scrolls of Identification (not too many, as
      reading the last one frees a slot) should be enough, since you'll pick
      up some ID scrolls while you are down there. Read the scrolls
      _first_.

=============================================================================

7) Paladins

      Paladins fight almost as well as Warriors. They get spells right from
      the first level as well. 

      Suggestion: Dunedain Paladin. Try: Str 18/12, Wis 18, Dex 10, for
      the same benefits as the Human Ranger above. Find a light weapon
      to wield for multiple attacks / round.

      Half-Elves make excellent Paladins, since they have slightly
      improved Stealth and Searching---the weaknesses Paladins have.

      Humans make playable paladins as well. If you have not played a
      human before, a Paladin might be a good one to try.

    General Hints for Paladins

      Basically, you are ALMOST as good a fighter as a Warrior (without
      ANY special bonuses--REMEMBER THAT). You should be
      relying on your good hand-to-hand fighting, rather than bows/arrows,
      since you're not that good at them. Use a hit-and-run technique, since
      you don't have the special bonuses Warriors get which enable them
      to stay in a fight with even dangerous critters for a decent amount of
      time. 

      Play like a Warrior to begin with. You get Orb of Draining _much_
      later than a Priest (not until level 17), but you should be tough
      enough to make it until then. As with a Priest, you can force OoD by
      not learning spells for a level or two before, and dropping the earlier
      books (*DON'T FORGET TO PICK THEM UP AGAIN*). Use
      detection spells a lot - they help you make the most of your fighting
      ability. A Paladin with OoD is a formidable sight. Also Protection
      from Evil is extremely useful.


=========================================================================

8) Other class advice

Basically, Warriors are easier at the beginning and hardest to win
with. Mages are hardest to start with, and easiest to win with.
Priests have less offensive spells than mages, but do get really cool
heal spells later. While a mage can begin with an offensive spell, a
priest will not get an offensive spell until level 9 - Orb of Draining
(a very good spell).

Rangers are easy to start and play when first learning the game. You
get the toughness and durability of Warriors, with a few mage spells
to help out along the way. You might like to try a Half-Elf or Elf
Ranger to start.

High elves and Dunedain (yes, it's plural - Dunadan is singular) make
good characters of any class, but they have the slowest rate of going
up levels. They're good when you're first learning the game, but are
very slow to win with.

Gnomes : Their free action intrinsic more than compensates for the
lousy hit-dice, at least for spell casters. They get good racial
adjustments to most stats except hand-to-hand melee. 

Dwarves are reasonable characters as well, especially as Priests or
Warriors.

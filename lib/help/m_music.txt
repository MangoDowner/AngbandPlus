It has often been said the "Music soothes the Savage Beast", and Harpers
know this is a fact. They carry songbooks around the dungeon with them, 
and by singing the songs within them gain the power to soothe beasts, 
enhance their own courage, etc. The songs continue to be sung until either
the Harper chooses to stop, or he runs out of the energy required to sing
that type of song - some can take quite an effort to sing!

It contains some attack spells, some utility spells, some combat-
enhancing spells, and a few healing spells.

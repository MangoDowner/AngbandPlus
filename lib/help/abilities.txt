NEWANGBAND 1.7.1 COMPLETE ABILITIES GUIDE
-------------------------------------------

This guide deals about every abilities for every classes. This
is a must for everyone, as it contains the basic of all abilities
in the game. Each classes have 10 abilities. Each of them is
described, has information about how raising it helps, and also
offers some advice on how to use it properly.

WARRIOR
---------

1. Spin Attack(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Damage all enemies around you.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Radius: 1
Type: Physical
Extra points: +1 multiplier to damages

Spin attack does physical damages to enemies around you. It can be
useful is you are surrounded, and it's also a helpful ability to
defeat the physical returning bosses, as special physical attacks
such as this one or physical-type spells are not returned to you.
It can also become quite powerful should you decide to invest
some points into it.

2. Strength(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your strength by 3%
Extra points: +3% additional strength bonus

This passive ability adds some percentile bonus to your strength.
While your strength can become impressive if you put a lot of
points into this ability, having too much strength can become
useless later in the game. A good idea would be to put less
points into strength, and invest in this ability to compensate.
This allow you to put more points into other stats, while
keeping a high strength.

3. Increased Life(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your maximum hp by 3%
Extra points: +3% additional hp bonus

This passive ability adds some percentile bonus to your hp.
If you play a melee character, you will most likely want to put
some points into this ability, as it is a great way to reach
a high amount of hp, which will be helpful to survive melee
and magic attacks from later monsters. This ability can also
help out magic users, although magic users can make some
physical or magic resistance spells instead.

4. Battle Skill(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your to_hit and to_dam by 10
Extra points: +10 additional to_hit and to_dam bonuses

This passive ability adds some to_hit and to_dam bonuses. This
ability is a good alternative to raising your dexterity. In
addition, it will also give some boost to your damages.
Warrior Mage type characters could use this ability to get their
desired to_hit, while raising intelligence instead of dexterity.

5. Accurate Strike(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Attack that never miss.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Radius: None(single enemy)
Type: Physical
Extra points: +1 multiplier to damages for every 2 points

The main feature of this ability is that it never miss. And if you 
put many points into this ability, it can become powerful as
well. It's also good to put at least a single point into this
ability early in the game, if your to_hit is not very high.
Like all other physical special abilities, it can be used to
defeat the physical damages returning bosses.

6. Hardiness(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Gives +15 bonus to_ac
Extra points: +15 additional to_ac bonus

This passive ability adds some to_ac bonus. Of course, the best way
to get a very high AC is to raise your agility skill and combine it
with good armor, but if defense isen't your main concern, yet you
want to have a good amount of it, this ability can help you. +15
to_ac is good, and putting only a few points into this ability
can make a good difference early in the game.

7. War Cry(Active, level 6)

Effect: Scare nearby enemies
Duration: 5
Radius: 3
Type: Demoralize
Extra points: +1 to duration

War Cry uses a demoralize type effect to scare nearby enemies. Does not
work against elites, bosses and uniques. Nonliving and fear
resistant monsters will also not be affected. This ability is very good
when you are surrounded, and the enemies are too powerful for you.
The duration is short at first, but if you put a few points into
it, it can become very useful as an emergency ability.

8. Counter Attack(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Strike the monster when it miss you.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Type: Physical
Extra points: +1 multiplier to damages for every 2 points.

Counter attack is a passive ability that makes it dangerous for enemies
to attack you. This ability is very good for characters who focus a
lot on defense. Every time the enemy miss you, you strike back. If you
have a lot of AC, you will benefit a lot from this ability.

9. Leaping Spin(Active, level 6, combat feat)

Effect: Jump, then perform a spin attack upon landing.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Jump Radius: 5
Type: Physical
Extra points: +1 multiplier to damages for every 2 points.
	      +1 to jump radius for every 10 points.

Leaping spin has two main uses. The first one is to jump to an enemy
group, and damage multiple enemies at once. The second is to be used
as an escaping ability to flee powerful monsters. While not as powerful
as the regular Spin Attack, it has more uses than Spin Attack, and is
a more versatile ability.

10. Weapon Mastery(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Gives +2 to all melee weapon skills(rods excluded)
Extra points: +2 additional points to melee weapons skills

This powerful passive ability gives you a +2 bonus to all weapon
skills. With this ability, you can become very good with any kind of
weapons. However, note that there comes a point where putting too much
points into a single weapon skill does not benefit that much. You might
not notice the difference between having 150 swords skill and 250
during a melee attack. So, before wasting all your AP into this ability,
think about how much you should put, and how much you should keep
for other abilities. Or you could mainly rely on this ability to boost
your weapon skills high, and place your skill points into another skill.


MAGE
------

1. Mana Boost(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your maximum mana by 20.
Extra points: 20 additional mana

This passive ability increases your maximum mana by a fixed value. This
ability is very helpful early in the game, as it can give the needed
boost in your mana. However, later in the game, you might want to raise
the High Mage's Increased Mana ability, as it will provide greater bonuses 
in the long run. Nevertheless, this one will help you getting the spells 
you need in the beginning.

2. Force Field(Active, level 1)

Effect: Gives you 25% resistance to physical and magical attacks.
Duration: 5
Extra points: +2 to duration, +1% resistance for every 5 points.

Mage characters typically don't have as much hp as melee characters, and
this ability is meant to help them overcome that somewhat. The resistance
starts at 25% and has short duration, but the duration can rise quickly.
Of course, when you have a very high amount of mana, you may want to make
your own protection spells using the Physical Resistance and Magic
Resistance effects, but this one gives you both resistances, can get
a very good duration and cost absolutely no mana to use. Because of that,
this is a nice ability that you can get early and that any characters can
benefit from.

3. Magic Missile(Active, level 1)

Effect: Cast a magic missile bolt at a single enemy.
Damages: 15/level
Type: Missile
Extra points: +15 damages/level

This magic missile spell is the most basic type of spell you could ever
imagine, however, it cost no mana to cast, and if you put a lot of
points into it, it can become quite powerful. Missile is part physical,
part magical, so your spellcraft will not work at full potential with
this spell, and the physical damages reduction for high level monsters
will apply to half of the damages. Nevertheless, this ability should 
not be overlooked, as a free spell like this one can be used to kill 
lesser enemies, and allow you to fill your spell slots with bigger 
spells for bigger enemies.

4. Spell Absorbtion(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Regain mana from enemy spells(10% of spell damages)
Extra points: +10% absorbtion

This passive ability allow you to regain mana when an enemy cast an
offensive spell at you. Note that this ability does not prevent any
damages, and you will still suffer damages from enemy attacks.
Also note that if you use resistance spells, you will take less
damages, but that also mean you will recover less mana. If you have
a good hp, and you place some points into this ability, it can
become an effective way to recover your mana in the middle of a
battle!

5. Slow Down(Active, level 1)

Effect: Cast a ball that slow down one enemy by 5%.
Radius: 0
Extra points: +1% speed reduction for every two points.
	      +1 to radius for every 20 points.

This ability is similar to the old curse spell "Slow Down" from
NewAngband 1.6.0. It reduce the speed of the enemies by a percentile
value. At first, 5% is not much, but if you put a couple of points
into it, it will become more powerful, and it's radius will increase.
Spellcraft will also help increasing the radius. This ability is
very useful to slow down large packs of enemies at higher level. 
Note that it does not work against elites and bosses, as well as the 
main questors. Also, it will only work once on a particular enemy.

6. Mirror Images(Active, level 1)

Effect: Create illusions to distract foes.
Number: 3
Level: Same as yours
Hp: Same as yours
Extra points: +10% hp per points.
	      +1 illusion for every 5 points.

This ability will create several illusions of yourself, with the
same level and hp as you. The more points you place in this ability,
the more hp they will have, and the more illusions there will be.
The images are meant to be used as a decoy to distract foes, and
allow you to escape, or move away and cast spells while your
illusions gets pummeled. Note however that this ability is not very
effective to avoid magical attacks, so it probably won't protect you
from enemies breaths. Also, if you like this ability, try having
a high hp to make your illusions more durable.

7. Damages Curse(Active, level 6)

Effect: Curse an enemy to damage itself when damaging you.
Damages: Monster's attack damages.
Radius: 0
Extra points: +1 damages multiplier.
	      +1 to radius for every 20 points.

This ability curse one monster(or more, depending on spellcraft and
the level of this ability) to take damages as it attacks you. This
ability can be very useful if you put some points into it. But a
great feature of this ability is that nothing can resist the returned
damages, so this ability can be very useful to kill a monster
immune to physical attacks or one that returns damages. If you plan
to use this ability a lot, make sure you have a good hp, as you will
still take damages from enemy attacks. This is one of the few cursing
spells that will actually works against ANYTHING, including the main 
questors.

8. Drain Object(Active, level 6)

Effect: Drain an item's power to regain your mana.
Amount: 50 mana per pval points
Extra points: +20 to mana recovery per pval points

This ability allow you to drain an item's power to recover your mana.
Of course, doing so will permanently weaken the item, but since there
are plently of magic items you won't use, this can be a good way to
use them, especially if you use a lot of big, mana consuming spells.
Note that this ability will not work with self-made magic items. Also
note that if you use this on stacked items such as magic arrows, they
will ALL lose their power.

9. Stone To Gold(Active, level 6)

Effect: Turn an item into gold.
Amount: 10% of item's base cost value
Extra points: +10% item's cost value gold

Turning objects into gold has always been a dream, and it can finally
come true! By using this ability, you can sacrifice an item, and turn
it into gold. The amount you gain is based on the item's base cost value,
not on it's calculated value. This means that turning a special item
into gold will not give you more than turning a normal item. This
ability will not work on self-made or store brought items.

10. Animated Knight(Active, level 10)

Effect: Construct a magically animated knight from various items.
Level: Same as yours
Hp: Varies(depends on what you use)
Extra points: +1 multiplier to monster's hp
	      +2 to monster's level
              +5% to base dice damages(you don't have to reconstruct 
	      the knight for this bonus to apply)

This ability allow you to construct a knight from various pieces of
equipement. You will need five pieces of equipement: a weapon, a
hard armor, an helm, gauntlets and boots. The amount of defense
of the items will determine it's hp and defense, and the weapon's
power will determine the knight's base damages. Any bonuses
to_hit will be added to the monster's hit rate. The knight will
be marked as an imprinted monster, so it will not leave you when you
go to another dungeon level. If you place many points in this ability
and use strong weapons, the knight can become a very dangerous
opponent. To maximise it's damages, you should also raise your
leadership skill and your charisma.

PRIEST
--------

1. Heal(Active, level 1)

Effect: Restore your hp.
Healing: 10/level
Extra points: +1 healing/level for every 2 points
	      With 15 points or higher, this will also cure bleeding
	      and poison.

This ability allow you to restore your hp for free. Healing spells
are fairly costly to create, so this ability is very useful to heal
yourself without spending the mana for it. Melee characters and
warrior/mage type characters will benefit a lot from this ability.
If you place at least 15 points in this ability, it will also cure
bleeding and poison.

2. Turn Undeads(Active, level 1)

Effect: Destroy undead creatures around you.
Radius: 10
Maximum undead level: 2
Damages to elites/bosses/uniques: 40/level
Extra points: +2 to maximum undead level
	      +40 damages/level to undead elites/bosses/uniques

Turn Undeads will affect all undead creatures around you in a radius of 10
(more if you have high spellcraft skill). If the affected creatures are
equal or inferior to the maximum undead level, they will be destroyed. 
How many points you should place in this ability can be a hard
choice. Putting 100 points is probably worthless, unless you enjoy using
this ability against elite, boss and unique undeads. You could combine
this ability with a level weakening effect to make turning easier, meaning
you would need less points in this ability. It is up to you to find what
works best for you. It is also good to know that you will not share the
damages of Turn Undeads if you use it on magic returning bosses.

3. Divine Blood(Passive, level 1)

Effect: - Improve all stats by 1%
        - Improve Hp regeneration
Regenration bonus: +5 hp per turns
Extra points: +1% to stats
              +5 to regenerated hp

Divine Blood is a jack-of-all-trades stats boosting ability, in that it
will increase all your stats, but by a much lesser amount than other
stat boosting abilities such as the warrior's Strength ability. However,
Divine Blood also provide increased regeneration that can be a real help
in the beginning, and can still be very useful later in the game.

4. Mace Of Heaven(Active, level 1)

Effect: Conjure a powerful, light-branded mace weapon.
Damages: 2d4
To_hit, to_dam: +1 per levels
Abilities: Light Branded, Indestructible
Duration: 10
Extra points: +1d1 base damages for every 4 points.
	      +2 to duration

The mace is the traditional weapon of good priests, and this ability allow
them to make a prayer to the holy gods, who will answer them by sending
the priest a powerful, holy weapon. With only one point, this will summon
a 2d4 mace with Light Brand, and it's also a little lighter than the common 
mace. If you put a lot of points, the mace then becomes a very potent weapon. 
When using this ability, it will unequip your current weapon, and the mace 
will appear in your wielding slot, and you won't be able to unequip it until 
is disappear by itself. Make sure you raise your Hafted weapon skill if you 
plan on using this ability.

5. Dark Prayer(Active, level 1)

Effect: All stats(except wisdom) are raised by 5%, at the cost of half
	your max hit points.
Duration: 5
Extra points: +5% to stats
	      +1 to duration

By praying the dark gods, they will empower you, but at the price of your
life. When using this ability, you will instantly lose an amount of hp
equal to half your MAXIMUM hit points, so don't use this when you are
low on health. After that, your stats will be raised temporarly, and the
bonus can be extremely useful if you place several points in this ability.
A useful ability, as long as you use it wisely.

6. Holy Might(Active, level 1)

Effect: Gives you Blessing, Haste and 20% resistance to physical attacks.
Duration: 5
Extra points: +1 to duration
	      +1% physical resistance for every 3 points.

This ability allow to get both Blessing(raise to_h and AC) and Haste
(speed +10), as well as giving you a 20% physical resistance. This ability
is very useful to any type of melee characters, as it instantly sets them
ready for the battle ahead. Both Haste and Blessing are very helpful,
and a 20% resistance to melee attacks can never hurt. And if you decide
to invest in this ability, the resistance can improve as well.

7. Harm(Active, level 6)

Effect: Does magic damages to a close enemy.
Damages: 20/level
Type: Mana
Extra points: +20 damages/level

The opposite of Heal, Harm will cause damages to an enemy close to you.
The damages done are very high, especially with a lot of points, and
spellcraft skill can raise the damages. However, note that this attack
has no range, and the enemy must be close to you for this to work, so
it can be a risky ability. If you plan to use it a lot, having a good
hp and AC can help you in case a monster would hit you.

8. Forbidden Ritual(Active, level 6)

Effect: Summon a large group of lesser demons.
Number: 20
Level: Varies
Hp: Varies
Extra points: Improve the type of demons you summon.
	      With 50 or more points, major demons can also
	      start to appear.

By using this ability, the priest calls the dark gods to assist him. To use
this ability, you will need to have at least 200 points of mana, and you
will lose it all when you use this spell, as a sacrifice. Once done, a group
of lesser demons will appear to assist you. The higher your level, the better
the demons. This ability is very useful, as it will always summon a
considerable number of minions. A very useful ability for those who like to
use summoning spells, or who just need descent cannon fodder. To make this
ability more powerful, raise your Leadership skill and your Charisma.

9. Divine Armor(Active, level 6)

Effect: Temporarely raise your AC.
Duration: 5
AC Bonus: 30
Extra points: +30 to AC
	      +1 to duration

This ability allow you to raise your AC by a good amount for a while. If you
plan on engaging powerful melee opponents, this can be a good ability to use
before the battle, to ensure that the monsters will have trouble hitting
you. If you have a high agility and great armor, and then add this bonus,
you can become VERY hard to hit.

10. Godly Wrath(Passive, level 10)

Effect: All monsters are cursed in various ways:
	- Level is halved
	- Hp is halved
	- Hit rate is halved, defense becomes 0
	- Non-Unique monsters receive the Lock curse.
Tribute: Item with pval 22+ 
Extra points: -1 to tribute's pval for every 5 points

This ability allow you to conjure the wrath of the gods to strike upon your
foes. But you will have to offer a magical item as a tribute. The item's pval
must be very high, but it becomes less when you invest points in this ability.
Once the sacrifice completed, all monsters in the current dungeon level will
receive the above curses, elites, bosses and uniques included. Only the main
questors will not be affected. This ability is very powerful, however, you
will have to invest points into it if you plan to use it often, as items with
a pval of 20+ are extremely rare, and cannot be obtained until VERY late in
the game. This ability will not work with self-made items.

ROGUE
-------

1. Hide In Shadows(Active, level 1)

Effect: Makes you invisible and raise your AC.
Invisibility Strength: 10
AC bonus: +10
Duration: 10
Extra points: +1 to duration
	      +1 to invisibility strength
	      +10 bonus AC

This ability gives you invisibility for a duration, as well as a bonus to AC.
This ability is useful to make your way past enemy ranks without fighting, and 
if you happen to fight them, you will have an increased AC to avoid blows more 
easily. Note that higher level enemies will have an easier time spotting you
while invisible.

2. Backstabbing(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improve the effectiveness of backstab attacks.
Bonus to backstab: +1 multiplier to backstab damages
Extra points: +1 multiplier to backstab damages.

When your Stealth skill reaches 30, you gain the ability to backstab sleeping
enemies for three times normal damages(or fleeing enemies for half normal
backstab damages). With this ability, you can raise the damages of backstab
attacks. Don't place points in this ability if you don't plan to raise your 
Stealth skill.

3. Dexterity(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your dexterity by 3%
Extra points: +3% additional dexterity bonus

This passive ability adds some percentile bonus to your dexterity.
This ability works the same way as the warrior's Strength ability,
except it raises Dexterity instead. Unless you play as a marksman
type character, having too much dexterity is not that benefical,
so one strategy would be to use this ability to get your high
dexterity, and save stat points for other stats such as Strength
or Intelligence.

4. Thievery(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your chances of stealing.
Extra points: Increase chances of stealing.

This passive ability increase your odds of stealing in shops, but also
items from monsters. Often will you find some nice, very expensive items
in shops, especially the Black Market. Instead of buying that special
cloak that gives you +160% life and +16 extra blows, why not steal it?
If you raise this ability high, you can greatly raise your odds of
stealing. With 100 points, your odds are 100%! But remember that in
the Black Market, you will never find the best items in the game, so
consider that before investing all your points in this ability.

5. Spike Trap(Active, level 1)

Effect: Set a trap on the floor.
Damages: Weapon's damages * 3(max roll)/level
Type: Physical
Extra points: +1 multiplier to weapon's damages

This ability allow the rogue to set a trap on the floor. When an enemy
walks on the trap, a spike will rise and will impale the enemy. This
mechanical device is made from a polearm, so you will need to sacrifice
a polearm-type weapon to make the trap. You can use any polearms,
including self-made or manually enchanted ones. The stronger the
polearm, the better the trap. This ability is most useful in narrow
corridors, as monsters are sure to walk in your trap.

6. Poison Weapon(Active, level 1)

Effect: Put a poison brand on a non-magical weapon.
Extra points: For every 14 points, you can put a Slay brand on your
	      weapon(Dragon Slaying, Demon Slaying, etc...).

With only one point, this ability allow you to make a weapon a lot
stronger by adding a poison brand. If you invest some points, you can
put one or more slay brands on your weapon. While this ability does
not work with magical items, it can be extremely useful early in the
game. If you use item conjuration spells or abilities(such as the
Priest's Mace Of Heaven), you can use this ability to enhance these
weapons, making them a lot better. Investing a lot of points in this
ability might not be useful however, so you probably shouldn't
waste all your points here.

7. Gas Trap(Active, level 6)

Effect: Set a gas trap on the floor that will put enemies to sleep.
Radius: 3
Extra points: Improves trap's success rate
	      +1 to radius for every 20 points.

This ability allow the rogue to set a gas trap on the floor. When an enemy
walks on the trap, a sleeping gas will be released, and it will put monsters
to sleep. Whether the trap works or not depends on the monster's level
versus ability level. Using this on higher level enemies will be much harder,
unless you placed several points in this ability. This ability is mostly
useful to backstabbing characters, because it will allow them to do so more
often, but it can be useful for weaker characters who must slow down some
powerful monsters. It will cost 500 golds to set a gas trap, to cover the
trap's material cost, so make sure you have some gold on you if you plan
on using this. This will not work on uniques and bosses(but elites can be
affected), and on sleep resistant monsters.

8. Poison Trap(Active, level 6)

Effect: Set a poisoning trap on the floor.
Damages: Weapon's damages(max roll)/level(max roll)
Type: Poison
Extra points: +1 multiplier to weapon's damages.

Much like the Spike Trap, this one works in a similar way, except it does
poison-type damages. A poison-branded weapon is required to make the trap,
so make sure you have one(you can use Poison Weapon to add poison brand). 
The damages increase may seem less than the Spike Trap, but keep in mind 
that physical attacks suffers from the monster physical damages reduction 
at higher levels(in fact, the poison trap is a little stronger at higher 
levels, but there are also a lot of poison-resistant enemies). Use the 
spike trap on enemies immune to magic  or resistant to poison, and use this 
one on the other enemies. Or specialise into either, and compensate with 
melee attacks or spells.

9. Evasion(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Increase your AC bonus and allow you to evade magical attacks.
Bonus to AC: 10
Chance to evade magic: 5%
Extra points: +10 to AC
	      +1% to evade magical attacks(up to a maximum of 75%)

This passive ability allow you to get a bonus to your AC, but the greatest
benefit is the ability to avoid magical attacks and breaths from enemies.
However, in order to make this ability really effective, you will need to
invest a couple of points into it, as 5% chance to evade is not much. If
you are only interested in the AC bonus, then the warrior's Hardiness or
the priest's Divine Armor can do it better. This ability doesn't override
the Evade Magic feat from the agility skill, although both tests are done
separatly.

10. Rogue Mastery(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Gives +2 to stealth and agility skills
Extra points: +2 additional points to stealth and agility skills

Stealth and agility are the rogue's hallmark, and this ability is there to
honour these abilities. Working the same way as the warrior's Weapon
Mastery, this passive ability gives a boost to both Stealth and Agility
skills. You can use this ability to boost the skills, and keep your skill
points for other skills, or you can use this to further raise the already
high skills, turning you in an invisible, untouchable stalker!

RANGER
--------

1. Wilderness Lore(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Helps you know more about your surroundings.
Radius: 3
Extra points: +1 to radius for every 4 points.
	      +1 to infravision for every 3 points.
	      With 20 or more points, you gain Telepathy.

Wilderness lore acts like if you were casting a Reveal type spell around
yourself as you walk. It's a free, passive ability that can very well
replace a torch or any other light sources. At higher level, it can be
useful to know where exactly you are going, and it's also extremely
useful to see all monsters, allowing you to elaborate plans to defeat

to ranged attackers, who can summon a vine field, and then shoot the slowed

spells later in the game. If you only want the animals as a decoy, then only
one of very few points might be needed. You can try placing more points if you
use the monster generator, as it will generate more types of animals. If you

use this ability to get your required healing, and entirely forget about
creating healing spells, especially considering the fact that receiving
healing won't take you any moves. Unlike other summoning spells, this one
doesn't require you to raise your Leadership skill, as the nymphs will not
fight, and their healing spells have a fixed healing amount.

your combat ability becoming very powerful. The duration is not too long, but

slots. But before placing several points into this, remember that there
you can always create multi-effect spells, and that sometimes it is
better to create a multi-effect spell than using more than one slot.

spell will be countered. If you fail, you will lose 20% of your 
mana. When an enemy cast a spell, you may choose to attempt to counter
the spell or not. Try to save this for powerful enemies. If a weak
enemy is casting a fire bolt, taking the damages is probably the best
thing to do. However, if a powerful unique tries to summon ancient
dragons, this may be fatal to you, and countering the spell might be
just what you need to do.

augmented, meaning that damage spells will do more damages, alterations
will be more effective, summoning spells will summon more creatures
and so on. However, know that an empowered spell will cost three times
more mana to cast, so if you plan on using empowered spells, make sure
you invest enough points in the ability for the extra mana cost to be
worth it.

status inflicting spells, such as spells that reduce hit rate, defense,
level, speed or scare enemies away. Also include positive alterations,

Effect: Gives +2 to spellcraft skill.
Extra points: +2 additional points to spellcraft skill

Similar to the other mastery abilities such as Weapon Mastery or Rogue Mastery,
this passive ability gives you a bonus to your spellcraft skill. If you
want your spellcraft skill to become extremely high, and thus cast devastating
offensive spells, then you should consider raising this skill. Or, you could
use this ability to get your desired spellcraft while spending your skill
points on other skills.

Second, it's considered a magical attack, so full damages will apply, unlike
physical attacks. And third, it allow you to take down the monsters immune

against high level monsters.

chosen element. It is very useful when you get yourself surrounded, or if you
have a lot of armor and wish to take on a physical immune monster. It is also
useful if you are slow or unable to move(either knocked out or paralyzed).
And of course, if you are about to face a monster who use magical attacks of
your element, it will make their spells useless. Magic damages from this
ability are not returned by magic returning bosses.

damages may seem lesser than the monk's Ki Punch, but remember that this one
deals pure elemental damages, which isn't resisted by high level monsters.
Also, if you invest a lot of points in this ability, it will gain a radius,
which can be very devastating. Spellcraft skill can also help raising the
damages.

the enemy's resistances and abilities that might prevent your spells from
working. This ability can benefit greatly to pretty much any characters
who uses some kind of magic attacks or spells. These monsters abilities are
the bane of many characters, and raising this ability can be a good way to
give you a chance to actually defeat a boss that might be otherwise
impossible to kill. It will also give you an edge on the later questors,
as they tend to resist pretty much any kind of magic.

you can turn back and face them. It is also useful when moving trough
large group of enemies. Also note that the damages from this ability are
not returned, so it can be useful to take down bosses that are immune to
physical and magic returning. Spellcraft will help raising the power and
radius of this ability.

that it will explode and kill them. This ability can be extremely deadly,
especially if you invest a lot of points into it and if you use powerful
weapons. The drawback to this is that you actually need to get your hands
on a magic weapon, and it must have at least a pval of 1, otherwise it
will not do any damages. Also, you cannot use self-made weapons, such as
a weapon enchanted with a Magic Item scroll. If you plan on focusing on
this ability, raising your Spellcraft will help doing more damages and
get a larger radius.

useful when used in narrow corridors, and your Spellcraft skill can help
raising the damages as well.

even more helpful if you cast a lot of offensive spells, as this will
make them more powerful, and it is cumulative with any Spellcraft
bonus.

MONSTER MAGE
--------------

1. Monster Magics(Active, level 1)

Effect: Allow you to learn and use monster magics.
Extra points: +10% to monster magics damages.

This ability is the main spellcasting power of the Monster Mage class. 
This ability replaces the 'm' command with it's very own spellcasting
system. Monster Mages can naturally cast and learn monster magics,
but other classes will need at least one point in this ability. If you
plan on using monster magics, make sure you build your character
accordingly. Magical breath attacks are your strongest powers, and
their damages are based on your current hp, so make sure you have
a good constitution. There are many advantages of using Monster
Magics over regular spells, although you won't have as much control
over the effects of the spells. On the other hand, all monster
magics cost a mere 5 mana to cast. Remember that once you get this
ability, you will gain the ability to switch between monster magics
and regular spells, so if you need a spell to back you up, you can
have it!

creature, you can assume it's shape at any times, for as long as
you wish. You will then be able to use their various powers. Like
your regular monster magics, monsters breaths are their strongest
powers, and are based on your current hp. Unlike your regular
shape, your hp will not be calculated using your constitution,
but using your level, so you don't need a high constitution if
you plan to morph a lot. Note that life boosting abilities
will not affect your hp while morphed, it is entirely based
on your level and which monster you are morphing into. Many monsters 
will not have access to weapons, so if you plan on morphing a lot, 
raising your Martial Arts skill is needed in order to fight in 
melee effectively. Monsters with stronger melee attacks will, of 
course, make you much more effective in combat.
WARNING: If you use elemental melee attacks, magic returning
monsters WILL return damages!!

any classes, and it is especially useful to Monster Mages, as their
magical breath attacks are based on their hp. It is up to you to decide
how much hp you need, but generally, it's a good idea to have a lot
of it later in the game.

Effect: Increase your Leadership skill while morphed.
Bonus to Leadership: +3
Extra points: +3 to Leadership skill.

This passive ability increases your Leadership skill while being
morphed. This is a very useful ability if you plan on using a lot
of summoned creatures to defeat your foes. Of course, being only
effective while morphed, you have to build your character
accordingly should you decide to focus in this ability. A monster
with summoning abilities is the best choice to use with this
ability. Since there are less of those monsters early in the
game, you may wish to wait before placing points in this.

5. Monstrous Martial Arts(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your Martial Arts skill while morphed.
Bonus to Martial Arts: +2
Extra points: +2 to Martial Arts skill.

This passive ability increases your Martial Arts skill while being
morphed. If morphing is your trade, then this ability will increase
your melee fighting ability a lot. Unarmed monster attacks are
greatly affected by your Martial Arts skill, and morphing into a
monster with better attacks will result is much greater damages.

6. Dominate Monster(Active, level 1)

Maximum monster level: 2
Chance: 50%

a very useful way of making a monster join should it be too tough
to defeat otherwise, especially if your Leadership skill is good.

Leadership ability to easily raise your Leadership skill. This
ability does not work on uniques, elites and bosses.

Bonus to base AC: +10% of Morphed creature's base AC
Extra points: +10% of Morphed creature's base AC.

This passive ability gives you a bonus to your AC. Because many
monsters are restricted in their equipment, and therefore you can't
always have a good armor while morphed, this ability can largely 
make up for it. It raises your base AC, so Agility skill will help
making the bonus even higher. The bonus depends on the creature
you morphed into. If you morph into a creature with higher base AC,
you will get a higher bonus to your base AC.

8. Monstrous Wave(Active, level 6)

Effect: Emits a wave of energy that can damage multiple enemies.

your enemies. It is a chain attack, and thus can hit multiple
enemies. The damages are based on your form's first melee attack,
and the type varies depending on the attack's type. If you
wish to use this skill, make sure your Martial Arts skill is high,
as it will greatly raise the damages done by this ability.

giving them the ability to cut trough an enemy's defense and hit
rate, making them easier to hit, and they will have a harder time
hitting you. It can be very useful if your own defense or hit
rate is not too high, or if you just want to get an edge over
powerful foes. Uniques, elites and bosses, while affected, will 
only lose 10% the amount a normal enemy would lose. Note that
you need to perform a successful hit rate test to actually hit
with this ability, and it is done separatly from the normal
melee attack. Even if you attack with magical damages, you need
to perform the test for this ability to trigger.

10. Improved Life Force(Passive, level 10)

Effect: The maximum hp limit is increased.
Hp limit: +3%
Extra points: +3% to maximum hp limit.

This passive ability increases your life limit. Normally, the maximum 
life is 30000, but with this ability, you can make it higher. Later 
in the game, you will be able to morph into very big creatures, and 
you may wish to go over the 30000 hp cap. This ability works even if 
you don't morph, so if you somehow reach the 30000 hp limit otherwise, 
it can go even higher!

Effect: Increase your to_ac bonus while wearing hard or dragon armor.
AC bonus: Base armor defense.
Extra points: +(Base armor defense) to AC.

you an AC bonus based on it. This can be very useful, especially if
you get a high defense, special armor, in which case your AC can
become phenomenal should this ability be high enough. While the AC
bonus of this ability is not affected by Agility, raising your
Agility can be a good way to further improve your already impressive
defense.

damages and the stronger enemies will do less, so they will pose
less of a threat. If you combine this with a physical resistance
spell or ability, you can become near-immune to physical attacks
or at least highly resistant! Note that Iron Skin applies before
any resistance spells.

Effect: Does physical damages and sends the enemy away.

sending them away, keeping you out of harm's way. The main use of this

strong shield and a high multiplier, it can also become a fairly
good damage dealing attack, and it can be used safely against damages
returning bosses.

4. Shield Fighting(Passive, level 1)

		+1% chance to block(the maximum is still 75%).

This passive ability gives you multiple bonuses to your combat abilities
while using a shield. While some of the strongest weapons are two-handed,
many powerful weapons are one-handed. If you choose this ability, the
Swords and Axes weapons are recommended. The best one-handed swords are
stronger than the best one-handed axes, but axes are more common. This
ability will also give you a small bonus to blocking chance, so if you
are using a smaller shield, it can help compensate the lesser blocking
chance.

in this ability. Nevertheless, this can easily replace any magic
resistance spells should you invest some points. The chance to block is
equal to your normal blocking chance.

chance that if you use it, you may end up confused. Whenever you would 
take damages, you will be asked whether or not you want to guard these 
damages. If you do, they will be reduced by a certain amount depending
on how much points you invested in Great Guard. When you use great
guard, you have 20% chance of getting confused if you use it again.

Extra points: +(armor's AC) to hp.

armor's AC value. Should you decide to invest some points in this
ability, it can become very effective, especially if you have a hard
armor with a very high defense. If you want to place your stat points
in Strength rather than Constitution, this can be a good way to
compensate for your hp.

to your defense and physical resistance for 20 turns. If you kill
another monster, then you will get another, cumulative bonus, and

you become, and if you place many points in this ability, it can
quickly boost your defense. The maximum defense bonus you can get

ability. It can be very useful if you face a large pack of strong enemies,
or if you are low on hp and want to be safer. Uniques, elites and bosses

Also, you can place the creature anywhere you want, so you
can place it in many strategic spots. However, when you use
this ability, your soul will need to recharge itself for

deadlier. Furthermore, the damages from this ability are NOT returned
by returning bosses, so that makes it even more useful, as you can

INVISIBLE ability, so you should still put some points into a weapon 
skill in case you encounter an invisible enemy. Also note that this

invisibility spell or ability. However, note that while the bonus to
speed of this ability seems quite high, it will NEVER exceed your
invisibility's strength. So if you use Shadow Cloak and get an
invisibility strength of 3, the maximum speed bonus of this ability
will be 3. Placing some points in this ability will allow you to
get quite a bit faster, but don't invest too much if your
invisibility is not powerful.

teleport to. You cannot teleport on walls or monsters, so be aware
that this ability might not ALWAYS allow you to escape, unless you
know where you're going. Note that when you use this, you will use
a portion of your hp, so be careful not to abuse it, and use it
only if you need it.

erraticaly. If you have trouble hitting enemies, avoiding blows

the erriatical moves, but will still be affected by the mist's 
penalities.

your mana will return to it's maximum amount if it became
higher due to this ability.

not your stealth skill.

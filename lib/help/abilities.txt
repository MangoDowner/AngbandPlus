PORTRALIS 0.2 COMPLETE ABILITIES GUIDE
-------------------------------------------

This guide deals about every abilities for every classes. This
is a must for everyone, as it contains the basic of all abilities
in the game. Each classes have 10 abilities. Each of them is
described, has information about how raising it helps, and also
offers some advice on how to use it properly.

Whenever an ability says "Can be resisted: Yes", this means that
the monsters affected may resist the ability. Generally, the standard
test opposes the player's ability level * 10 versus the monster's level
and mind stat. For example, the Warrior's "War Cry" ability can be
resisted by monsters. If the Warrior puts 5 points into War Cry, the
War Cry has a strength of 50. If he uses it against a level 1 Kobold,
the Kobold's mind is 5, and level is 1, so the Kobold's resistance
is 6. Then, a number is rolled between 1 and 50 for the player, and
between 1 and 6 for the Kobold. If the player rolls a number equal
or higher than the Kobold, the player succeeds. Otherwise, the Kobold
succeeds in resisting the ability.

WARRIOR
---------

1. Spin Attack(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Damage all enemies around you.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Radius: 1
Type: Physical
Extra points: +20% to damages.

Spin attack does physical damages to enemies around you. It can be
useful is you are surrounded, and it's also a helpful ability to
defeat the physical returning bosses, as special physical attacks
such as this one or physical-type spells are not returned to you.
It can also become quite powerful should you decide to invest
some points into it.

2. Strength(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your strength by 3%
Extra points: +3% additional strength bonus

This passive ability adds some percentile bonus to your strength.
Higher strength will result in higher damages, and this ability
can allow you to have a lot of it.

3. Increased Life(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your maximum hp by 3%
Extra points: +3% additional hp bonus

This passive ability adds some percentile bonus to your hp.
If you play a melee character, you will most likely want to put
some points into this ability, as it is a great way to reach
a high amount of hp, which will be helpful to survive melee
and magic attacks from later monsters. This ability can also
help out magic users, although magic users can make some
physical or magic resistance spells instead.

4. Battle Skill(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your to_hit and to_dam by 10
Extra points: +10 additional to_hit and to_dam bonuses

This passive ability adds some to_hit and to_dam bonuses. This
ability is a good alternative to raising your dexterity. In
addition, it will also give some boost to your damages.
Warrior Mage type characters could use this ability to get their
desired to_hit, while raising intelligence instead of dexterity.

5. Accurate Strike(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Attack that never miss.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Radius: None(single enemy)
Type: Physical
Extra points: +10% to damages.

The main feature of this ability is that it never miss. And if you 
put many points into this ability, it can become powerful as
well. It's also good to put at least a single point into this
ability early in the game, if your to_hit is not very high.
Like all other physical special abilities, it can be used to
defeat the physical damages returning bosses.

6. Hardiness(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Gives +15 bonus to_ac
Extra points: +15 additional to_ac bonus

This passive ability adds some to_ac bonus. Of course, the best way
to get a very high AC is to raise your defense and agility skills
and combine them with good armor, but if defense isen't your main 
concern, yet you want to have a good amount of it, this ability can 
help you. +15 to_ac is good, and putting only a few points into this 
ability can make a good difference early in the game.

7. War Cry(Active, level 6)

Effect: Scare nearby enemies
Duration: 5
Radius: 3
Can be resisted: Yes
Extra points: +1 to duration
              Increased chance of success.

War Cry uses a demoralize type effect to scare nearby enemies. Does not
work against elites, bosses and uniques. Nonliving and fear
resistant monsters will also not be affected. This ability is very good
when you are surrounded, and the enemies are too powerful for you.
The duration is short at first, but if you put a few points into
it, it can become very useful as an emergency ability. Monsters with
high level and mind stat may resist this ability.

8. Counter Attack(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Strike the monster when it miss you.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Type: Physical
Extra points: +20% to damages.

Counter attack is a passive ability that makes it dangerous for enemies
to attack you. This ability is very good for characters who focus a
lot on defense. Every time the enemy miss you, you strike back. If you
have a lot of AC, you will benefit a lot from this ability.

9. Leaping Spin(Active, level 6, combat feat)

Effect: Jump, then perform a spin attack upon landing.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Jump Radius: 3
Type: Physical
Extra points: +10% to damages.
	      +1 to jump radius for every 10 points.

Leaping spin has two main uses. The first one is to jump to an enemy
group, and damage multiple enemies at once. The second is to be used
as an escaping ability to flee powerful monsters. While not as powerful
as the regular Spin Attack, it has more uses than Spin Attack, and is
a more versatile ability.

10. Weapon Mastery(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Gives +2 to all melee weapon skills(rods excluded)
Extra points: +2 additional points to melee weapons skills

This powerful passive ability gives you a +2 bonus to all weapon
skills. With this ability, you can become very good with any kind of
weapons. However, note that there comes a point where putting too much
points into a single weapon skill does not benefit that much. You might
not notice the difference between having 150 swords skill and 250
during a melee attack. So, before wasting all your AP into this ability,
think about how much you should put, and how much you should keep
for other abilities. Or you could mainly rely on this ability to boost
your weapon skills high, and place your skill points into another skill.

FIGHTER
---------

1. Sheer Power(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase base damages rolls of any melee attacks.
Base roll increase: +10%
Extra points: +10% to base roll.
              +5% to Power Attack multipliers.

This passive ability raises the base damages roll of any melee attacks
you make. Since the base damages roll is a key factor in determining
total damages, this passive ability can easily turn a melee attack into
an extremely powerful one. This works with both armed and unarmed
attacks. Also, each points will increase the power attack multipliers
by 5%. So if you have 20 points in Sheer Power, a level 1 power
attack will do 4 times normal damages, a level 2 will do 6 times normal
damages and a level 3 will do 8 times.

2. Defensive Fighting(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Use fighting skill to increase AC.
Bonus to AC: Fighting skill.
Extra points: +1 multiplier to bonus.

This passive ability increase your AC based on your Fighting skill.
This can be very useful, as it allows you to use a single skill to raise
both your offensive and defensive power. If you need extra AC, but do
not want to raise agility or defense, this ability can be of help.

3. Taunt(Active, level 1)

Effect: Lure enemies around you into attacking you.
Taunt's strength: 10
Radius: 5
Can be resisted: Yes
Extra points: +10 to Taunt's strength

This ability allows you to taunt enemies into attacking you. When provoked,
the enemies will be mad at you, and will want to attack you at any costs,
making several mistakes in the process. Taunted enemies will have their
hit rate and defense reduced by 33%, and will fail spellcasting 50% of the
time. However, because they are eager to kill you, they will gain +3 to
speed. Also, for every points of charisma above 5, the strength of taunt
increases by 5. The bonus from charisma will never exceed the base taunt's
strength though. Nonliving enemies(such as golems) and undeads are not
affected by taunt. Uniques cannot be taunted either.

4. Critical Hits(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Target weak points while fighting, to paralyze and damage heavily.
Dirty Fighting strength: 5
Paralysis duration: 2 turns
Can be resisted: Yes(strength is used instead of mind)
Extra points: +5 to Critical Hit's strength.
              +1 to paralysis duration for every 20 points.

This passive ability will allow you to get a chance to both paralyze
the enemy you're fighting, as well as do double damages. Note that
this ability will only work when attacking enemies with normal melee
attacks. It will not work when using combat feats. Whenever you strike
an enemy, a test of critical hit's power versus the monster's level
and strength will be performed. If the monster fails the test, it will
be stunned, and will take double damages. Any enemies immune to paralysis
will be immune to critical hits. Uniques cannot be paralyzed, but they
can still take double damages if they fail the test. Also note that to
paralyze, you must do at least 1 point of damages. If you deal no
damages when striking(such as hitting a boss with weapon immunity, or
a monster with 100% physical resistance), you won't paralyze.

5. Unarmed Fighting(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Uses your Fighting skill to improve unarmed attacks.
Unarmed base damages roll bonus: 5% of Fighting skill.
Extra points: +5% of Fighting skill added to unarmed base rolls.
              +1 unarmed attack blow for every 5 points.

This passive ability will allow you to greatly improve your unarmed
attacks using the Fighting skill. The ability will take a certain
percentage of your Fighting skill, and directly add it to the base
damage rolls of any unarmed attacks. For example, with a Fighting
skill of 20, you would get a lousy 1d3 attack roll. However, with
20 points in Unarmed Fighting, you would get 1d3+20, resulting in 
a much greater base roll of 21 to 23. With some points in this
ability, raising the Fighting skill may eventually become as powerful
or even better than the Martial Arts skill, but unlike Martial Arts,
Unarmed Fighting can be used while wearing armor and shields without
any penalities. Note that this ability is calculated after the
Sheer Power ability, so the bonus from Unarmed Fithting is not
increased by the Sheer Power ability.

6. Fighter's Accuracy(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your hit rate based on your Fighting skill.
Bonus hp: +3/fighting skill points.
Extra points: +3 bonus to_hit per Fighting skill points.

This passive ability will allow you to get a higher hit rate based
on your Fighting skill. This can be useful, and fairly quick way
of greatly increasing your hit rate. With only 10 points in this ability,
you will get 30 extra to_hit per points in Fighting skill, allowing
you to get a high hit rate without the need of raising dexterity,
and allowing you to focus in strength or constitution.

7. Defensive Power Attacks(Passive, level 6)

Effect: When using the Power Attack feat, you gain a bonus to AC,
        as well as physical and magic resistance.
Bonus to_ac: +100
Physical/magical resistance: 15%
Duration: Power Attack's duration.
Extra points: +100 bonus to_ac.
              +1% to physical/magical resistance(maximum 75%).

Using a Power Attack leaves you vulnerable for a few turns, but with
this passive ability, you will gain some bonuses to AC, physical
resistance and magic resistance, thus making you a lot less vulnerable,
and will make Power Attacks less risky. If you plan on using a lot
of Power Attacks, this is an ability to consider.

8. Throw(Active, level 6, combat feat)

Effect: Grab an enemy, and throw it to deal damages.
Damages: Base unarmed damages.
Distance: 3
Extra points: +10% to damages.
              +1 to distance for every 20 points.
              Allow you to throw heavier enemies.

This ability allow you to grab an enemy, and throw it away. This is
a useful ability, as it allows you to deal damages while keeping
enemies away from you. Beware, however, that some enemies are too
heavy to throw, unless you place a lot of points in this ability.
There is no way to know a monster's weight, though common sense
can help a lot here(an ancient dragon is usually bigger and heavier
than a three foot kobold...). This ability is best combined with
Unarmed Fighting, to get more damages out of it.

9. Extreme Strike(Active, level 6)

Effect: When using Power Attack, you may use this attack to deliver
        a very powerful blow, and send enemies far away.
Damages: Base weapon/unarmed damages.
Distance: 5
Extra points: +1 multiplier to damages.
              +1 to distance for every 5 points.

This ability allow you to deliver a very powerful blow to an enemy,
and knock it very far away. This is a very powerful ability,
especially since you have to use Power Attack first, resulting in
even more power. Enemies will take major damages, and will not
have a chance to retaliate. Do be careful however, as if the
ability miss, you will have wasted several turns preparing the
Power Attack and using Extreme Strike, and ultimately fail to do
any damages. Fighter's Accuracy can be a good ability to raise
to help ensuring the success of this ability.

10. Fighting Mastery(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Gives +2 to Fighting skill.
Extra points: +2 additional points to Fighting skill.

This powerful passive ability gives you a +2 bonus to the Fighting
skill. Since many abilities of the Fighter depends on having a high
Fighting skill, this ability will help you getting this high skill.
You can use this ability to gain a very high Fighting skill, or use
it to raise your skill while investing the skill points in another
skill.

MAGE
------

1. Mana Boost(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your maximum mana by 20.
Extra points: 20 additional mana

This passive ability increases your maximum mana by a fixed value. This
ability is very helpful early in the game, as it can give the needed
boost in your mana. However, later in the game, you might want to raise
the High Mage's Increased Mana ability, as it will provide greater bonuses 
in the long run. Nevertheless, this one will help you getting the spells 
you need in the beginning.

2. Force Field(Active, level 1)

Effect: Gives you 25% resistance to physical and magical attacks.
Duration: 5
Extra points: +2 to duration, +1% resistance for every 5 points.

Mage characters typically don't have as much hp as melee characters, and
this ability is meant to help them overcome that somewhat. The resistance
starts at 25% and has short duration, but the duration can rise quickly.
Of course, when you have a very high amount of mana, you may want to make
your own protection spells using the Physical Resistance and Magic
Resistance effects, but this one gives you both resistances, can get
a very good duration and cost absolutely no mana to use. Because of that,
this is a nice ability that you can get early and that any characters can
benefit from.

3. Magic Missile(Active, level 1)

Effect: Cast a magic missile bolt at a single enemy.
Damages: 10/(Int - 5)
Type: Missile
Extra points: +10 damages/(Int - 5)

This magic missile spell is the most basic type of spell you could ever
imagine, however, it cost no mana to cast, and if you put a lot of
points into it, it can become quite powerful. Missile is part physical,
part magical, so your spellcraft will not work at full potential with
this spell. Nevertheless, this ability should not be overlooked, as a 
free spell like this one can be used to kill lesser enemies, and allow 
you to fill your spell slots with bigger spells for bigger enemies.

4. Spell Absorbtion(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Regain mana from enemy spells(10% of spell damages)
Extra points: +10% absorbtion

This passive ability allow you to regain mana when an enemy cast an
offensive spell at you. Note that this ability does not prevent any
damages, and you will still suffer damages from enemy attacks.
Also note that if you use resistance spells, you will take less
damages, but that also mean you will recover less mana. If you have
a good hp, and you place some points into this ability, it can
become an effective way to recover your mana in the middle of a
battle!

5. Slow Down(Active, level 1)

Effect: Cast a ball that slow down one enemy by 5%.
Radius: 0
Can be resisted: Yes
Extra points: +1% speed reduction for every two points.
	      +1 to radius for every 20 points.

This ability is similar to the old curse spell "Slow Down" from
NewAngband 1.6.0. It reduce the speed of the enemies by a percentile
value. At first, 5% is not much, but if you put a couple of points
into it, it will become more powerful, and it's radius will increase.
Spellcraft will also help increasing the radius. This ability is
very useful to slow down large packs of enemies at higher level. 
Note that it does not work against elites and bosses. Other enemies
may resist it. Also, it will only work once on a particular enemy.

6. Mirror Images(Active, level 1)

Effect: Create illusions to distract foes.
Number: 3
Level: Same as yours
Hp: Same as yours
Duration: 10
Extra points: +10% hp per points.
	      +1 illusion for every 5 points.
              +1 to duration.

This ability will create several illusions of yourself, with the
same level and hp as you. The more points you place in this ability,
the more hp they will have, and the more illusions there will be.
The images are meant to be used as a decoy to distract foes, and
allow you to escape, or move away and cast spells while your
illusions gets pummeled. Note however that this ability is not very
effective to avoid magical attacks, so it probably won't protect you
from enemies breaths. Also, if you like this ability, try having
a high hp to make your illusions more durable.

7. Damages Curse(Active, level 6)

Effect: Curse an enemy to damage itself when damaging you.
Damages: Monster's attack damages.
Radius: 0
Can be resisted: Yes
Extra points: +1 damages multiplier.
	      +1 to radius for every 20 points.
              Increased chance of successful cursing.

This ability curse one monster(or more, depending on spellcraft and
the level of this ability) to take damages as it attacks you. This
ability can be very useful if you put some points into it. But a
great feature of this ability is that nothing can resist the returned
damages, so this ability can be very useful to kill a monster
immune to physical attacks or one that returns damages. If you plan
to use this ability a lot, make sure you have a good hp, as you will
still take damages from enemy attacks. This is one of the few cursing
spells that will actually works against ANYTHING, elites, bosses
and uniques. However, note that monsters can resist it.

8. Drain Object(Active, level 6)

Effect: Drain an item's power to regain your mana.
Amount: 50 mana per pval points
Extra points: +20 to mana recovery per pval points

This ability allow you to drain an item's power to recover your mana.
Of course, doing so will permanently weaken the item, but since there
are plently of magic items you won't use, this can be a good way to
use them, especially if you use a lot of big, mana consuming spells.
Note that this ability will not work with self-made magic items. Also
note that if you use this on stacked items such as magic arrows, they
will ALL lose their power.

9. Stone To Gold(Active, level 6)

Effect: Turn an item into gold.
Amount: 10% of item's base cost value
Extra points: +10% item's cost value gold

Turning objects into gold has always been a dream, and it can finally
come true! By using this ability, you can sacrifice an item, and turn
it into gold. The amount you gain is based on the item's base cost value,
not on it's calculated value. This means that turning a special item
into gold will not give you more than turning a normal item. This
ability will not work on self-made or store brought items.

10. Animated Knight(Active, level 10)

Effect: Construct a magically animated knight from various items.
Level: Same as yours
Hp: Varies(depends on what you use)
Stats/skills: 10
Extra points: +1 multiplier to monster's hp
	      +2 to monster's level
              +5% to base dice damages(you don't have to reconstruct 
	      the knight for this bonus to apply)
	      +1 to stats

This ability allow you to construct a knight from various pieces of
equipement. You will need five pieces of equipement: a weapon, a
hard armor, an helm, gauntlets and boots. The amount of defense
of the items will determine it's hp and defense, and the weapon's
power will determine the knight's base damages. Any bonuses
to_hit will be added to the monster's hit rate. The knight will
be marked as an imprinted monster, so it will not leave you when you
go to another dungeon level. If you place many points in this ability
and use strong weapons, the knight can become a very dangerous
opponent. To maximise it's damages, you should also raise your
leadership skill and your charisma. The animated knight does not have
a duration. It is permanent until destroyed.

PRIEST
--------

1. Heal(Active, level 1)

Effect: Restore your hp.
Healing: 10/(Wis - 5)
Extra points: +1 healing/(Wis - 5) for every 2 points
	      With 15 points or higher, this will also cure bleeding
	      and poison.

This ability allow you to restore your hp for free. Healing spells
are fairly costly to create, so this ability is very useful to heal
yourself without spending the mana for it. Melee characters and
warrior/mage type characters will benefit a lot from this ability.
If you place at least 15 points in this ability, it will also cure
bleeding and poison.

2. Turn Undeads(Active, level 1)

Effect: Turn, destroy or damage undead creatures around you.
Radius: 10
Turn Power: 10
Damages: 20/(Wis - 5)
Extra points: +10 to turn power.
	      +20 damages/(Wis - 5) to all undeads

When affected by this ability, undead creatures will attempt to resist
it. Two numbers will be rolled. The first one is the turning's strength,
and is equal to a random number between 1 and the Turn Power. The
second number is the undead's resistance, which is a random number
between 1 and (level + mind stat). If the turn strength is twice stronger
than the resistance, the undead is turned, and will now fight for you.
Othwerise, but if the turn strength is still higher than the resistance,
the undead will be destroyed. If the resistance is higher than the turn
strength, the undead is not instantly destroyed, although it still takes
damages of 20/(Wis - 5), which can be improved by Spellcraft.

3. Divine Blood(Passive, level 1)

Effect: - Improve all stats by 1%
        - Improve Hp regeneration
Regenration bonus: +5 hp per turns
Extra points: +1% to stats
              +5 to regenerated hp

Divine Blood is a jack-of-all-trades stats boosting ability, in that it
will increase all your stats, but by a much lesser amount than other
stat boosting abilities such as the warrior's Strength ability. However,
Divine Blood also provide increased regeneration that can be a real help
in the beginning, and can still be very useful later in the game.

4. Mace Of Heaven(Active, level 1)

Effect: Conjure a powerful, light-branded mace weapon.
Damages: 2d4
To_hit, to_dam: +1 per levels
Abilities: Light Branded, Indestructible
Brand Damages: 50
Duration: 10
Extra points: +1d1 base damages for every 4 points.
              +50 to brand damages.
	      +2 to duration

The mace is the traditional weapon of good priests, and this ability allow
them to make a prayer to the holy gods, who will answer them by sending
the priest a powerful, holy weapon. With only one point, this will summon
a 2d4 mace with Light Brand, and it's also a little lighter than the common 
mace. If you put a lot of points, the mace then becomes a very potent weapon. 
When using this ability, it will unequip your current weapon, and the mace 
will appear in your wielding slot, and you won't be able to unequip it until 
is disappear by itself. Make sure you raise your Hafted weapon skill if you 
plan on using this ability.

5. Dark Prayer(Active, level 1)

Effect: All stats(except wisdom) are raised by 5%, at the cost of half
	your max hit points.
Duration: 5
Extra points: +5% to stats
	      +1 to duration

By praying the dark gods, they will empower you, but at the price of your
life. When using this ability, you will instantly lose an amount of hp
equal to half your MAXIMUM hit points, so don't use this when you are
low on health. After that, your stats will be raised temporarly, and the
bonus can be extremely useful if you place several points in this ability.
A useful ability, as long as you use it wisely.

6. Holy Might(Active, level 1)

Effect: Gives you Blessing, Haste and 20% resistance to physical attacks.
Duration: 5
Extra points: +1 to duration
	      +1% physical resistance for every 3 points.

This ability allow to get both Blessing(raise to_h and AC) and Haste
(speed +10), as well as giving you a 20% physical resistance. This ability
is very useful to any type of melee characters, as it instantly sets them
ready for the battle ahead. Both Haste and Blessing are very helpful,
and a 20% resistance to melee attacks can never hurt. And if you decide
to invest in this ability, the resistance can improve as well.

7. Harm(Active, level 6)

Effect: Does magic damages to a close enemy.
Damages: 20/(Wis - 5)
Type: Mana
Extra points: +20 damages/(Wis - 5)

The opposite of Heal, Harm will cause damages to an enemy close to you.
The damages done are very high, especially with a lot of points, and
spellcraft skill can raise the damages. However, note that this attack
has no range, and the enemy must be close to you for this to work, so
it can be a risky ability. If you plan to use it a lot, having a good
hp and AC can help you in case a monster would hit you.

8. Improved Wisdom Casting(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Improve the success rate of wisdom-based spellcasting.
Extra points: - Add 1 to cast strength/wisdom for every 10 points.
	      - Casting strength improves by 10% for every points.
	      - For every 20 points, adds 1 to the "risky" spell multiplier.

This ability will increase the success rate of wisdom-based spellcasting.
Normally, according to the formula of wisdom-based spellcasting, you
get a casting strength of 5 for every Wisdom points higher than 5. By
raising this ability, the casting strength will also increase, allowing
you to cast more spells for free, increase your success rate and even
reduce the chance of backfiring. Also, normally, a risky spell is a spell
that costs more than three times your casting strength. For every 20
points, this will increase(with 20 points, a risky spell will be a spell
that costs more than four times. At 40, it becomes five times and so on).
If you plan on focusing on wisdom-based spellcasting, you should consider
placing some points in this ability.

9. Divine Armor(Active, level 6)

Effect: Temporarely raise your AC.
Duration: 5
AC Bonus: 30
Extra points: +30 to AC
	      +1 to duration

This ability allow you to raise your AC by a good amount for a while. If you
plan on engaging powerful melee opponents, this can be a good ability to use
before the battle, to ensure that the monsters will have trouble hitting
you. If you have a high agility and great armor, and then add this bonus,
you can become VERY hard to hit.

10. Godly Wrath(Passive, level 10)

Effect: All monsters on the current level are cursed in various ways:
	- Level is halved
	- Hp is halved
	- Hit rate is halved, defense becomes 0
	- Non-Unique monsters can no longer cast spells.
Tribute: Item with pval 22+ 
Extra points: -1 to tribute's pval for every 5 points

This ability allow you to conjure the wrath of the gods to strike upon your
foes. But you will have to offer a magical item as a tribute. The item's pval
must be very high, but it becomes less when you invest points in this ability.
Once the sacrifice completed, all monsters in the current dungeon level will
receive the above curses, elites, bosses and uniques included. Only the main
questors will not be affected. This ability is very powerful, however, you
will have to invest points into it if you plan to use it often, as items with
a pval of 20+ are extremely rare, and cannot be obtained until VERY late in
the game. This ability will not work with self-made items.

ROGUE
-------

1. Hide In Shadows(Active, level 1)

Effect: Makes you invisible and raise your AC.
Invisibility Strength: 10
AC bonus: +10
Duration: 10
Extra points: +1 to duration
	      +1 to invisibility strength
	      +10 bonus AC

This ability gives you invisibility for a duration, as well as a bonus to AC.
This ability is useful to make your way past enemy ranks without fighting, and 
if you happen to fight them, you will have an increased AC to avoid blows more 
easily. Note that higher level enemies will have an easier time spotting you
while invisible.

2. Backstabbing(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Improve the effectiveness of backstab attacks.
Bonus to backstab: +1 multiplier to backstab damages
Extra points: +1 multiplier to backstab damages.

When your Stealth skill reaches 30, you gain the ability to backstab sleeping
enemies for three times normal damages(or fleeing enemies for half normal
backstab damages). With this ability, you can raise the damages of backstab
attacks. Don't place points in this ability if you don't plan to raise your 
Stealth skill.

3. Dexterity(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your dexterity by 3%
Extra points: +3% additional dexterity bonus

This passive ability adds some percentile bonus to your dexterity.
This ability works the same way as the warrior's Strength ability,
except it raises Dexterity instead. Unless you play as a marksman
type character, having too much dexterity is not that benefical,
so one strategy would be to use this ability to get your high
dexterity, and save stat points for other stats such as Strength
or Intelligence.

4. Thievery(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your chances of stealing.
Extra points: Increase chances of stealing.

This passive ability increase your odds of stealing in shops, but also
items from monsters. Often will you find some nice, very expensive items
in shops, especially the Black Market. Instead of buying that special
cloak that gives you +160% life and +16 extra blows, why not steal it?
If you raise this ability high, you can greatly raise your odds of
stealing. With 100 points, your odds are 100%! But remember that in
the Black Market, you will never find the best items in the game, so
consider that before investing all your points in this ability.

5. Evasion(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your AC bonus and allow you to evade magical attacks.
Bonus to AC: 10
Chance to evade magic: 5%
Extra points: +10 to AC
	      +1% to evade magical attacks(up to a maximum of 75%)

This passive ability allow you to get a bonus to your AC, but the greatest
benefit is the ability to avoid magical attacks and breaths from enemies.
However, in order to make this ability really effective, you will need to
invest a couple of points into it, as 5% chance to evade is not much. If
you are only interested in the AC bonus, then the warrior's Hardiness or
the priest's Divine Armor can do it better. This ability doesn't override
the Evade Magic feat from the agility skill, although both tests are done
separatly.

6. Poison Weapon(Active, level 1)

Effect: Put a poison brand on a weapon.
Poison damages: 50
Extra points: +50 poison damages.

This ability will give a poison brand to any weapons, gloves or ammos.
You can use this ability even on magical items, but note that if they
already have a brand, the ability will override it, as well as the
damages. This ability can be a great help to defeat enemies immune to
physical attacks, and will be especially useful to Kobolds due to
their natural bonus to poison damages. Poisoned arrows and bolts are
also very useful, as is enchanting a pack of daggers with poison to
throw at the enemies. Remember that if you use this on a magical item,
the item's pval will make the poison stronger. Also, if you use this
on an item that has a radius to the elemental brand, it will not
remove the radius, only change the brand and damages.

7. Gas Trap(Active, level 6)

Effect: Set a gas trap on the floor that will put enemies to sleep.
Radius: 3
Can be resisted: Yes
Extra points: Improves trap's success rate
	      +1 to radius for every 20 points.

This ability allow the rogue to set a gas trap on the floor. When an enemy
walks on the trap, a sleeping gas will be released, and it will put monsters
to sleep. Whether the trap works or not depends on the monster's level
versus ability level. Using this on higher level enemies will be much harder,
unless you placed several points in this ability. This ability is mostly
useful to backstabbing characters, because it will allow them to do so more
often, but it can be useful for weaker characters who must slow down some
powerful monsters. It will cost 500 golds to set a gas trap, to cover the
trap's material cost, so make sure you have some gold on you if you plan
on using this. This will not work on uniques and bosses(but elites can be
affected), and on sleep resistant monsters. Other enemies can resist it.

8. Poison Trap(Active, level 6)

Effect: Set a poisoning trap on the floor.
Damages: Weapon's base poison brand 
         damages(item's pval is ignored)/(Dex - 5)(max roll)

Extra points: +33% poison brand damages.

This ability allow the rogue to set a trap on the floor that will do
poison damages. A poison-branded weapon is required to make the trap,
so make sure you have one(you can use Poison Weapon to add poison brand). 
The stronger the weapon's brand, the stronger the trap. This ability is 
most useful in narrow corridors, as monsters are sure to walk in your trap.

9. Spike Trap(Active, level 6)

Effect: Set a trap on the floor.
Damages: Weapon's damages(max roll) * 10/(Dex - 5)(max roll)
Type: Physical
Extra points: +1 multiplier to weapon's damages

This ability allow the rogue to set a trap on the floor. When an enemy
walks on the trap, a spike will rise and will impale the enemy. This
mechanical device is made from a polearm, so you will need to sacrifice
a polearm-type weapon to make the trap. You can use any polearms,
including self-made or manually enchanted ones. The stronger the
polearm, the better the trap. This ability is most useful in narrow 
corridors, as monsters are sure to walk in your trap.

10. Rogue Mastery(Passive, level 10)

Effect: Gives +2 to stealth and agility skills
Extra points: +2 additional points to stealth and agility skills

Stealth and agility are the rogue's hallmark, and this ability is there to
honour these abilities. Working the same way as the warrior's Weapon
Mastery, this passive ability gives a boost to both Stealth and Agility
skills. You can use this ability to boost the skills, and keep your skill
points for other skills, or you can use this to further raise the already
high skills, turning you in an invisible, untouchable stalker!

RANGER
--------

1. Wilderness Lore(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Helps you know more about your surroundings.
Radius: 3
Extra points: +1 to radius for every 4 points.
	      +1 to infravision for every 3 points.
	      With 20 or more points, you gain Telepathy.

Wilderness lore acts like if you were casting a Reveal type spell around
yourself as you walk. It's a free, passive ability that can very well
replace a torch or any other light sources. At higher level, it can be
useful to know where exactly you are going, and it's also extremely
useful to see all monsters, allowing you to elaborate plans to defeat
them more easily.

2. Forestry(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your combat ability in forests/grass areas. Allow you to
	  walk trough trees.
Bonus to_hit: +20
Bonus to_dam: +20
Bonus to_ac: +20
Bonus to speed: +1
Bonus to stealth: +1
Extra points: +20 to_hit, to_dam and to_ac.
	      +1 to stealth.
	      +1 to speed for every 3 points.

The rangers are keepers of the forest and wilderness, and this ability allow
them to do so in a very effective way. Although this ability won't always be
active(as is only work when standing on grass or trees), the bonuses are
quite signifiant. Whenever you enter a dungeon level full of trees and grass,
this ability will become extremely powerful.

3. Entangle(Active, level 1)

Effect: Create a field of entangling vines to slow down enemies.
Radius: 1
Extra points: +1 to radius for every 5 points.

This ability allow you to summon vine fields. Enemies only have a 25% chance
of successfully walking trough a vine field, so it will make their movement
harder(note that they may move more than once depending on their speed, so the
vines will slow them down, but not completely stop them). This ability is useful 
to ranged attackers, who can summon a vine field, and then shoot the slowed 
enemies from a distance. Note that elites, bosses and uniques will have a 60% 
chance of walking trough a vine field, and giants('P'), ancient dragons('D') 
and plants/molds('m') aren't affected.

4. Animal Empathy(Active, level 1)

Effect: Charm animals around you, or make elites/boss/unique animals flee.
Radius: 5
Success rate: 25%
Extra points: +2% to success rate.
	      +1 to radius for every 10 points.

This ability allow you to make enemy animals around you friendly, or strike fear
in elite/boss/unique animals. While it only work on monsters marked as ANIMALS,
it can be very useful against some animals who travel in large packs, such as
hounds. Since the success rate increase by 2% for every points, investing tons
of points in this ability is probably not needed, unless you want to increase
it's radius. To make this ability even more useful, increase your Leadership
skill and Charisma, so that charmed animals will be able to do great damages!

5. Call Animal(Active, level 1)

Effect: Summon an animal to fight on your side.
Duration: 10
Extra points: Allow you to summon stronger animals.
		+1 to duration for every 2 points.

This ability allow you to summon a single animal to fight on your side. While
it will only summon one animal, you can use it multiple times, and create
yourself a small army. How many points you place in this ability is up to you,
but if you get higher mana, you might be better creating your own summoning
spells later in the game. If you only want the animals as a decoy, then only
one or very few points might be needed. You can try placing more points if you
use the monster generator, as it will generate more types of animals. If you 
plan on using this ability, make sure you raise your Leadership skill and 
Charisma, as it will make your animals a lot better.

6. Warp On Trees(Active, level 1)

Effect: Allow you to teleport to a nearby tree.
Radius: 5
Extra points: +1 to radius for every two points.

This ability allow you to teleport yourself to a nearby tree, allowing you
to flee from deadly enemy encounters. This ability can be extremely useful 
on forest levels, or if you combine it with the "Grow Trees" spell from the 
school of Conjuration. At first, the radius of this ability is not very
high, but it can become quite good should you invest some points into it.

7. Weapon Finesse(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Uses Dexterity instead of Strength to increase damages.
Max dexterity used: 5
Extra points: +5 to max dexterity used.

This passive ability allow you to use your dexterity to deal damages instead
of your Strength. This can be useful, as dexterity will then provide both
damages increase and better hit rate. But it can be especially good if
you also plan on raising your Shooting skill. This way, you will be very
good at both melee combat and ranged combat.
The way this ability is used is that for every points of dexterity higher
than 5, you will get a +5 to_d and a general +(dexterity)% to damages, just
like strength. However, if your dexterity is let's say 15, but this ability
is only at level 1, you will only be able to get the damage bonus up to
a dexterity of 10. Thus, your last 5 points of dexterity will be ignored.
Also note that this ability is not cumulative with strength. If your
strength results in a higher damages bonus, it will be used instead.

This ability allow you to place thorned vines on the floor. Enemies passing
trough the fields will take earth type damages. This ability is good to
stop a horde of small enemies, but if you invest many points into it, it can
become good to stop any kind of enemies. The radius will increase over time,
although not much, but a starting radius of 2 is good, considering this
ability cost no mana to use.

9. Sleep Pollen(Active, level 6)

around you to sleep. This ability can be quite useful if you are surrounded
by powerful enemies, or if you combine this with backstabbing abilities. The
success rate depends on the enemy's level and mind.
This ability will not work against elites, bosses and uniques.

10. Force Of Nature(Active, level 10)

Effect: Temporarely raise your Strength, Dexterity and Constitution.

Extra points: +3 to stats bonus.
		+1 to duration for every two points.

This ability allow you to empower yourself with the essence of nature, raising
your main combat stats, that is, Strength, Dexterity and Constitution. While
this ability can only be used on grass or trees type terrains, the bonuses are
considerable. If you place a couple of points in this ability, you will notice
your combat ability becoming very powerful. The duration is not too long, but
is probably enough to kill quite a couple of foes, especially if you have speed
bonuses. The best way to use this ability is to combine it with the Grow Trees
spell, as it will allow you to use it more often.

PALADIN

useful, as with only 15 points, you can get yourself an extra multiplier to your
damages. This can be very useful early in the game, so you can focus on other
stats such as Dexterity and Constitution, while getting a good Strength bonus
when you need it. The duration is short at first, but with a couple of points,
it will be enough to defeat a few foes before fading. And you can cast it anytime.

2. Holy Bolt(Active, level 1)

Damages: 10/(Wis - 5)
Type: Light
Extra points: +10 damages/(Wis - 5)

This ability allow you to cast a bolt of Light energy to your enemies. This is
a useful ability to take care of the monsters immune to physical attacks, or
if you want a fairly strong and reliable ranged attack. Also, there aren't so
many monsters that resists Light based attacks, so it will work fine on most
enemies. And if you place a couple of points into it, and raise your Spellcraft
skill, it can become a potent, free attack spell.

3. Aura Of Life(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Heal yourself and friendly monsters around you. Also damage undeads.

		+1 to radius for every 20 points.

This ability has many functions. The first one is to gradually recover some
hp while moving. The second is to heal friendly monsters around you, if you
have any. And finally, if there are any undeads around you, they will take
some damages. This ability can be quite useful, especially if you like having
lot of monsters with you, or if you want to be able to destroy undeads more
easily. Magic damages returning undeads will not return damages done by your
aura. Spellcraft will help raising the damages and healing on other monsters,
but will not affect the healing on yourself.

4. Smite Evil(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: A melee attack that damages evil creatures and scare them.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Maximum monster level for fear: 3
Extra points: +50% to damages.
              +3 to maximum level for fear.

Smite Evil will cause damages to evil creatures, and if their level is low
enough, it will scare them with 100% success rate. This attack will work on
any enemies, including elites, bosses and uniques, although the main questors
will never be affected by the fear. This attack does physical damages, so any
resistance to physical damages will apply, but like other physical special
attacks, damages returning bosses will not return damages. This ability will
not work on enemies that are not marked as Evil.

5. Blade Of Purity(Active, level 1)

Effect: Conjure a undead and demon slaying sword.
Damages: 2d5

get a sword that has both undead and demon slaying abilities. The sword's
power will also improve as you place points in this ability, and if you
invest a lot of points, it can become quite strong. Even one point will
provide you with a reliable sword and can be useful early in the game,
especially against undeads and demons.

6. Resist Impure(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Resistance to poison, nuke, darkness, nether and chaos attacks.
Resistance: 25%
Extra points: +2% resistance.

This passive ability grants you resistance to many impure type of magic spells,
as mentionned above. No items can give you immunity to the types mentionned
above, so should you decide to invest some points in this ability, you will
eventually become immune to five more attacks types. Furthermore, if you have
more than 100% resistance, you will actually be healed. So if you have let's
say 150% resistance to a 5000 damages poison breath, you will get healed for 2500
hp. Note that this ability does not add to normal resistances to other elements.
It is a separate source of protection.

7. Feat Of Faith(Active, level 6)

Effect: Gain blessing, bonus ac and a great bonus to your Strength and Dexterity.

This ability will give you enormous bonuses, but it will only last for one or
two actions, depending on your speed. This ability is mostly useful when you are
about to face a powerful and tough enemy, who would otherwise be too difficult
to hit or too hard to damage. Use it before you strike an enemy, but keep in
mind that while your defensive abilities are greatly augmented, the monster
might still be able to hit you.

Can be resisted: Yes
Extra points: Increased chance of success.
		+1 to radius for every 10 points.

normal monsters. Combined to the fact that this attack has a radius, it can
be very useful when you encounter large packs of undeads or demons, has these
groups often have at least one elite or boss. This is also useful when
fighting monsters that can summon monsters, as they might summon undead or
demonic elites and bosses. In the later parts of the game, some bosses are
extremely hard to kill, and having this free ability can save your life.

become very powerful, especially if you get both safety and life boosting
ability. You may even gain the Protection ability(all form of damages reduced
by half) if you focus on this ability. To maximize it's use, you should raise

This passive ability allow you to increase your base AC while not wearing
any armor. While the bonus might not seem so great, keep in mind that it
is the BASE AC that is increased, and that it is compatible with the
agility skill. If you raise both this ability and your agility skill, your
AC can become very high, and if you invest a lot in this ability, it may
become even better than the strongest suits of armor. Combined with the
bonus of the martial arts skill, this ability can easily help you forget
about wearing any kind of armor.

useful is you are surrounded, and it's also a helpful ability to
defeat the physical returning bosses, as special physical attacks
such as this one or physical-type spells are not returned to you.
It can also become quite powerful should you decide to invest
some points into it. This ability works exactly the same as the
warrior's Spin Attack, but it is entirely based on your to_d, so
in order to use it properly, make sure your Martial Arts skill
is high enough.

3. Hard Kick(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: Does physical damages and sends the enemy away.

force that it will be knocked away. This ability also do physical
damages, and it can become fairly powerful with many points. Should
you decide to invest a couple of points into it, you will notice
that you can keep knocking the enemy away, while slowly killing it
and it will never be able to hit you because you keep using the
Hard Kick. Make sure you have a good Martial Arts skill to maximize
the damage potential of this ability.

4. Grappling Throw(Passive, level 1)

Effect: When an enemy attacks, grab it and throw it away.

              +1 to radius for every 20 points.

When you get attacked, you will be prompted whether or not you want to 
attempt a throw attack. If you decide to try it, there will be a regular 
to_hit test. If you succeed, you will grab the enemy and throw it away, 
dealing some damages in the process as well. However, if you fail, the
monster will get a bonus to it's hit rate for the next attack. It is
important to know that this is not a damages dealing ability, but
rather a defensive ability, although it can do some nice damages. Also
note that if the enemy is too heavy, you will not be able to throw it.
Increasing your strength allow you to throw heavier creatures.

5. Wisdom(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your wisdom by 3%
Extra points: +3% additional wisdom bonus

This passive ability adds some percentile bonus to your wisdom.
Wisdom will give you bonus skill points if you raise it high enough,
and raising this ability can be the key to get an impressive amount
of skill points. How much points you place in this ability depends
on how much you value skill points. You could put less points into
wisdom and use this ability to compensate, or you could place a lot
of points into wisdom and raise this skill to gain tons of skill
points every levels!

this ability is that first of all, it never miss, and second, it can be
used against any kinds of opponents. Do note however that magic returning
bosses will return damages from this ability. Should you focus a lot
in this ability, it can become quite powerful, and while Martial Arts
skill should be the main way of empowering it, Spellcraft can also
slightly improve it as well.

Effect: Increase both your hp and mana.
Bonus: +15 to hp and mana.
Extra points: +15 additional points to hp and mana.

cast powerful spells without reducing your capacity to survive blows
from enemies.

skill, the greater your success rate with this ability. Elites, bosses and
uniques will be much harder to confuse. Elites/bosses immune to

invaluable to create the most powerful spells. You may want to raise the

will lose 20% of your mana. When an enemy cast a spell, you may 
choose to attempt to counter the spell or not. Try to save this 
for powerful enemies. If a weak enemy is casting a fire bolt, 
taking the damages is probably the bestthing to do. However, if a 
powerful unique tries to summon ancient dragons, this may be fatal 
to you, and countering the spell might be just what you need to do.

will be more effective, summoning spells will summon more creatures

worth it.

offensive spells, then you should consider raising this skill. Or, you could
use this ability to get your desired spellcraft while spending your skill
points on other skills.

useful if you are slow or unable to move(either knocked out or paralyzed).

especially if you invest a lot of points into it and if you use powerful

on a magic weapon, and it must have at least a pval of 1, otherwise it
will not do any damages. Also, you cannot use self-made weapons, such as

make them more powerful, and it is cumulative with any Spellcraft
bonus.

1. Monster Magics(Active, level 1)

Effect: Allow you to learn and use monster magics.
Extra points: +20% to monster magics damages.
	      Increased chance of learning the monster magic.

This ability replaces the 'm' command with it's very own spellcasting
system. Monster Mages can naturally cast and learn monster magics,
but other classes will need at least one point in this ability.
To learn a monster magic, the monster must cast the spell, and if it's
an offensive spell, you must survive it. If you do, then you will be 
prompted whether or not you want to learn the spell. If you say yes, 
you will then attempt to learn the spell. The success rate depends on 
the spell's casting cost versus your Monster Magics ability. If you
succeed, you will be able to learn the spell, and place it in one
of your 15 monster magics slots.

Compared to normal magic, monster magics have the advantage of being
very diverse, and generally less expensive. The drawback is that you
have less freedom over exactly what you will get, it all depends on
the monsters you are facing. Also, monster magics generally have lower
damages than regular magic, so make sure you raise the Monster Magics
ability a lot if you plan on focusing on Monster Magic.

Remember that once you get this ability, you will gain the ability to 
switch between monster magics and regular spells, so if you need a spell 
to back you up, you can have it! Also, you will have the option to turn
on and off the learning of monster magics, in case you do not want to
learn anything new.

creature, you can assume it's shape at any times, for as long as
you wish. You will then be able to use their various powers. Like
your regular monster magics, monsters breaths are their strongest
powers, and are based on your current hp. Unlike your regular
shape, your hp will not be calculated using your constitution,
but using your level, so you don't need a high constitution if
you plan to morph a lot. Note that life boosting abilities
will not affect your hp while morphed, it is entirely based
on your level and which monster you are morphing into. If you plan 
on morphing a lot, raising your Martial Arts skill is needed 
in order to fight in melee effectively. Monsters with stronger 
melee attacks will, of course, make you much more effective in 
combat.
WARNING: If you use elemental melee attacks, magic returning
monsters WILL return damages!!

any classes, and it is especially useful to Monster Mages, as their

how much hp you need, but generally, it's a good idea to have a lot
of it later in the game.

Effect: Increase your Leadership skill while morphed.
Bonus to Leadership: +3
Extra points: +3 to Leadership skill.

This passive ability increases your Leadership skill while being
morphed. This is a very useful ability if you plan on using a lot
of summoned creatures to defeat your foes. Of course, being only
effective while morphed, you have to build your character
accordingly should you decide to focus in this ability. A monster
with summoning abilities is the best choice to use with this
ability. Since there are less of those monsters early in the
game, you may wish to wait before placing points in this.

5. Monstrous Martial Arts(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your Martial Arts skill while morphed.
Bonus to Martial Arts: +2
Extra points: +2 to Martial Arts skill.

your melee fighting ability a lot. Unarmed monster attacks are
greatly affected by your Martial Arts skill, and morphing into a
monster with better attacks will result is much greater damages.

Leadership ability to easily raise your Leadership skill. This
ability does not work on uniques, elites and bosses.

Bonus to base AC: +10% of Morphed creature's base AC
Extra points: +10% of Morphed creature's base AC.

This passive ability gives you a bonus to your AC. Because many
monsters are restricted in their equipment, and therefore you can't
always have a good armor while morphed, this ability can largely 
make up for it. It raises your base AC, so Agility skill will help
making the bonus even higher. The bonus depends on the creature
you morphed into. If you morph into a creature with higher base AC,
you will get a higher bonus to your base AC.

8. Monstrous Wave(Active, level 6)

rate, making them easier to hit, and they will have a harder time
hitting you. It can be very useful if your own defense or hit
rate is not too high, or if you just want to get an edge over
powerful foes. Uniques, elites and bosses, while affected, will 
only lose 10% the amount a normal enemy would lose. Note that
you need to perform a successful hit rate test to actually hit
with this ability, and it is done separatly from the normal
melee attack. Even if you attack with magical damages, you need
to perform the test for this ability to trigger.

you an AC bonus based on it. This can be very useful, especially if
you get a high defense, special armor, in which case your AC can

less of a threat. If you combine this with a physical resistance
spell or ability, you can become very resistant to physical attacks
or at least highly resistant! Note that Iron Skin applies before
any resistance spells. Also note that it does not protect from
spells(ranged attacks are the monster's shooting techniques, based
on their dexterity, not the spells they cast with mana!).

This passive ability gives you multiple bonuses to your combat abilities
while using a shield. While some of the strongest weapons are two-handed,

take damages, you will be asked whether or not you want to guard these 
damages. If you do, they will be reduced by a certain amount depending
on how much points you invested in Great Guard. When you use great
guard, you have 20% chance of getting confused if you use it again.

Also, you can place the creature anywhere you want, so you
can place it in many strategic spots. However, when you use

just be what you need.

1. Stealth Attack(Active, level 1, combat feat)

Effect: When invisible trough a special ability(like Hide in Shadows),
	  this attack will use your Stealth skill to calculate damages
	  instead of the regular weapon skills.
Damages: Normal attack damages(branded weapons are not counted)
Type: Physical
Extra points: +20% to damages.

This ability allow the Shadow Stalker to make a good use of his/her 
stealth, by using it to calculate damages instead of regular weapon 
skills. This ability also has the advantage of allowing you to use any 
weapons with only one skill, which is a great feature. However, note 
that this ability will do no damages to monsters that have the 
INVISIBLE ability, so you should still put some points into a weapon 
skill in case you encounter an invisible enemy. Also note that this 
ability requires you to use a special ability to become invisible
(like Hide in Shadows or Shadow Cloak). If you are wearing a ring 
of invisibility, it will not grant you the power to use 
Stealth Attack!

2. Displacement(Passive, level 1)

Effect: You appear as a displaced image, and you are difficult to hit.
Extra points: Increased chance of avoiding blows.

This passive ability allow you to avoid physical blows from enemies.
This can be very effective, as it allow even a character with mediocre
AC to have a good chance of avoiding physical blows. Or, you can
combine this with a very high AC to make you extremely difficult to hit.

3. Shadow Cloak(Active, level 1)

Effect: Become temporarely invisible.
Invisibility strength: 20
Duration: 10
Extra points: +2 to duration.
		+3 to invisibility strength.

Shadow Cloak gives you temporary invisibility, and allow you to use
abilities such as Stealth Attack. While the invisibility is better and 
last longer than the Rogue's Hide in Shadows, Shadow Cloak will not
give you any bonuses to AC. Take that in consideration before choosing
to focus in either abilities.

4. Shadow Ball(Active, level 1)

Effect: When invisible, turn the shadows into a ball of darkness.
Damages: Stealth/(Dex - 5)
Type: Darkness
Radius: 2
Extra points: +20% to damages.
		+1 to radius for every 30 points.

This ability allow you to cast a ball of darkness at your enemies.
The damages are based entirely on your stealth skill, so if you want
this ability to be useful, you will need a high stealth skill. Also,
you need to be under a temporary invisibility spell or ability(such
as Hide in Shadows or Shadow Cloak) to be able to use this ability.

5. Shadow Run(Passive, level 1)

Effect: Increase your speed when invisible trough a special ability.
Speed increase: +1
Extra points: +1 to speed.

This ability allow you to become much faster when using a temporary
invisibility spell or ability. However, note that while the bonus to
speed of this ability seems quite high, it will never exceed your
invisibility's strength. So if you use Shadow Cloak and get an
invisibility strength of 3, the maximum speed bonus of this ability
will be 3. Placing some points in this ability will allow you to
get quite a bit faster, but don't invest too much if your
invisibility is not powerful.

6. Shadow Phase(Active, level 1)

Effect: Allow you to teleport to an unlit grid.
Radius: 3
Hit points loss: 25% of maximum hp.
Extra points: +1 to radius for every two points.

This ability allow you to teleport to an unlit grid of your choice,
within the ability's radius. This can be useful to escape dangerous
situations, but note that the fact that grids must be unlit make
it a risky ability, in that you never know what's on the grid you
teleport to. You cannot teleport on walls or monsters, so be aware
that this ability might not ALWAYS allow you to escape, unless you
know where you're going. Note that when you use this, you will use
a portion of your hp, so be careful not to abuse it, and use it
only if you need it.

7. Dark Mist(Active, level 6)

Effect: Cover an area with a dark mist, making it harder for enemies
	to see and hit you, and making it easier for you to hit them.
Hit Rate penality: -25%
Defense penality: -25%
Chance of erratical move: 25%
Radius: 1
Extra points: +1 to radius for every five points.
		+1% hit rate/defense penality for every two points.
		+1% chance of erratical move.

This ability will create fields of dark mist. Enemies in the mist
will suffer from reduced hit rate and defense, and will move
erraticaly. If you have trouble hitting enemies, avoiding blows
or you simply want to confuse their ranks, this ability can be
very useful. Elites, bosses and uniques will not suffer from 
the erriatical moves, but will still be affected by the mist's 
penalities.

8. One With Shadows(Passive, level 6)

Effect: Become extremely agile, dextrous and receive bonus AC
	when invisible trough a special ability.
Bonus to agility skill: Stealth / 4
Bonus to dexterity: Stealth / 4
Bonus to AC: Stealth
Extra points: +10% to bonuses.

This passive ability will give you bonuses to agility, dexterity
and AC based on your Stealth skill when invisible trough a special
ability(such as Shadow Cloak or Hide in Shadows). This will make
you much more competent in combat, and if you wear a good armor,
combined with the AC bonus, it might give you a very good AC due
to the agility skill bonus.

9. Shadow Magic(Passive, level 6)

Effect: When you become invisible trough a special ability, gain
	a mana bonus based on your stealth skill, that may exceed
	your maximum mana.
Mana bonus: Stealth
Extra points: +20% to mana bonus.

This passive ability will give you bonus mana when you become
invisible trough an ability, such as Shadow Cloak. This allow
you to potentially gain quite a good amount of mana without
raising your intelligence stat. When you become invisible,
you will immediatly gain the mana, and it can become higher
than your maximum mana. Note that once the invisibility ends,
your mana will return to it's maximum amount if it became
higher due to this ability.

10. Storm Of Shadow Edges(Active, level 10)

Effect: When invisible trough a special ability, attack within
	a short distance over a small radius.
Damages: Base weapon damages.
Range: 3
Radius: 1
Type: Darkness
Extra points: +20% to damages.

This ability allow you to select a point on the map. From this
point, a radius 1 darkness attack will occur, based on your
base weapon damages. This can not only be very powerful, but
it's also useful to defeat enemies immune to melee weapons.
Note that the weapon damages use regular weapon skills, and
not your stealth skill.

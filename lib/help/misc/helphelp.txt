=== Using the Online Help ===

You can press Escape (ESC) at any time to leave the online help.

You can press Question Mark (?) to return to the previous help file.

You can press Space to advance one page, or Return (RET) to advance one line.
If you reach the end of the help file, you will wrap around to the start.

You can press Minus (-) to back up one half page at a time towards the
start of the help file (this is very inefficient).

You can press Pound (#) [or Percent (%)] to go to a specific line [or file].

You can press Slash (/) [or Equals (=)] to search for [or hilite] a string
(case sensitive).  Use "#" + "0" + RET + "/" + RET to restart a search.

The Curse of Topi Ylinen
========================

This spoiler was made by Remco Gerlich for Zangband 2.1.1c. It may
be incorrect for other versions.

This spoiler explains the effects of The Curse of Topi Ylinen, aka
the "Ancient Foul Curse". It also describes what can invoke it.
It's Happy! It's Fun! It's the Curse of Topi Ylinen!
Do not taunt the Curse of Topi Ylinen.

o What can it do.
o What can invoke it.


What can it do.
===============

There are several effects.

The first six of these can "fall through": if one of these effects
happen, there is a 1/6 chance that the next effect also happens.
That effect could itself fall through, etc.

After these effects, there is another 1/3 chance of starting the whole
process anew, adding more effects; this can happen unless the player
is paralyzed or cyberdemons are summoned - the process stops here
when that has happened.

The end result is a decidedly nasty multiple effect thing, but it's not
as bad anymore as when it could both paralyze you AND summon cyberdemons
around you.

Effects:
5 in 27 chance: Aggravate monsters. May fall through to:

3 in 27 chance: "hi summon". Summon several strong monsters or groups
                of monsters around the player. May fall through to:

4 in 27 chance: Summon a monster. May fall through to:

3 in 27 chance: Loose 1/16 of your exp. May fall through to:

5 in 27 chance: Paralyze. Players with free action get a saving throw.
                Otherwise, paralyze 1d3 turns with free action, and
                1d13 without. May fall through to:

3 in 27 chance: Decrease a random stat. May fall through to:

1 in 27 chance: Amnesia - forget all. No fall through.

1 in 27 chance: If dungeon level > 65, summon cyberdemons, and stop the process.
                Otherwise, do the following effect:

2 in 27 chance: Decrease all stats. With each stat decrease, there's a 50%
                chance that it decreases again, etc.

And then, of course, if no cyberdemons were summoned and the player
isn't paralyzed: a 1 in 3 chance of doing it again.


What can invoke it.
===================

o   Equipment that you use may have the ancient curse. Every 10 game
    turns (1 normal speed player turn), there is a 1% chance of invoking
    the curse, for each object with the curse. That's often, imo.

o   As one of the effects of releasing wild magic when failing a Chaos spell.

o   When getting the Hanged Man with the Trump "Shuffle" spell.

o   There is a trap which first summons 2+1d3 monsters, and then, if
    dungeon level > 1d100, invokes the Curse. Each time the curse is
    invoked, there's a 1 in 6 chance that it happens again...

o   Dying Amberites have a 50% chance of putting a Blood Curse on you.
    This curses (some of) your equipment and invokes the Curse 1+1d3 times.
    That hurts.

o   As a Chaos Patron reward (either "ty curse", "wrath", or "piss off",
    see that spoiler).



Warning: pregnant women, the elderly and children under 10 should avoid
prolonged exposure to The Curse of Topi Ylinen.

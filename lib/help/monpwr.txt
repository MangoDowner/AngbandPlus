=== Body Powers ===

If you play a Soul Possessor or a Monster, it is quite possible that your
body has one or more innate powers.  They can have different nature -- they
can be magical spells, or breathes, or some other abilities; but they are
always accessed from "powers" menu, invoked by pressing 'U' ('|' in
roguelike keyset).

Body powers have much in common with usual magic.  They use mana to cast, and
they have a chance of failure.  Note that different bodies can use different
stats for mana and powers -- for example, spellcasters usually use INT, and
dragons CON.  You cannot use your powers when confused.  However, they do not
need light (or indeed any vision at all) or spellbooks.

This file is a "spoiler" of body powers, explaining what exactly they do.

HALF-OGRE
-----------

Half-Ogres are the cross between a human and an ogre. Half-Ogres
are very strong, tough and while certainly not the brightest
individuals, they do have a little more brain than other similar
races such as the Half-Orcs. However, because they are big and
tall, they are slow, and lack the agility to easily dodge blows.


====== The Dungeon ======

     All levels other than 0 (or zero feet) lie within the dungeon.  Each level
of the dungeon is fifty feet high, and is divided into large rectangular regions
(several times larger than the screen) by impenetrable walls.  Once you leave a
level, you will never again find your way back to that region of that level, but
there are an infinite number of other regions at that same depth that you can
explore later.  Monsters move about just as you do, and you may see them again.


--- Terrain ---

     The following terrain types affect movement, combat, or both.  Because they
less frequently take advantage of terrain, monsters benefit more from favorable
and suffer less from unfavorable terrain than the player does.

Rubble:
     Slows down the player and all monsters that cannot bore or pass through
rock.  Ends LOS, stops missiles, bolts, and beams, and reduces the radius of
ball spells.  Grants the player and monsters within it some protection from
melee, ranged, or magical attacks.  Rubble may dissolve to normal floor.

Water:
     Cannot be passed by players with heavy burdens, or fiery, earthbound
monsters.  All melee or ranged attacks and most spells benefit when the target
is in water, especially water-based spells.  Fire-based spells become much less
powerful, so find a lake if you battle Smaug.  Water may evaporate.

Lava:
     Can be passed by any character, but inflicts substantial fire damage (less
for players with feather fall - they're light on their feet).  All monsters
other than fiery or strong flying creatures will not cross.  Water and cold-
based spells suffer and fire-based spells become more powerful against a target
in lava.  Lava may freeze to rubble or normal floor.

Trees:
     Slows down players not familiar with druidic techniques, and all non-
natural monsters that neither fly nor pass through rock.  Ends LOS, stops
missiles, bolts, and beams, and reduces the radius of ball spells.  Grants the
player and monsters within it some protection from melee, ranged, or magical
attacks.  Trees can burn.

Permanent walls:
     You can dig through most walls but some are impenetrable.  The dungeon is
surrounded by these kinds of walls and some special rooms are made of them.

Staircases:
     Staircases allow your character to ascend or descend from one level to
another, and are represented by "<" (up) and ">" (down).  Each level has at
least one up staircase, and two down staircases, unless it is the home of Sauron
(level 99/4950') or Morgoth (level 100/5000'), whom you must kill before
staircases will appear.  Otherwise, the staircases are guaranteed, but they may
be difficult to find.  Once you leave a level, you can never return to it.  If
you found an artifact, identified it, and left it on the level, it is
permanently lost.  Watch out for spells and traps that can suddenly force you
off the level.

Secret doors:
     Many secret doors exist in the dungeon, and may lead to anything from a new
section of the dungeon level to an empty closet.  As your familiarity with the
dungeon grows, you will know where many secret doors are likely to be.  Secret
doors always look like granite until found and, for historical reasons, are
never locked.

Traps:
     Traps also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal floor squares
until found, too often by your getting caught by one.  They start out weak and
easy to disarm, but can get truly nasty further down...
     You find secret doors and traps by using the 's'earch command.  Many
classes can also use magic and everyone can use the appropriate magical device.
Be warned: although magical disarming is convenient, it is never a sure thing.

Mining:
     There is much treasure in the walls of the dungeon, just waiting for an
industrious adventurer to come and dig it out.  Once you can afford it, and if
you can handle the weight, bring a shovel or pick along.  Your ability to tunnel
depends on strength, weapon weight, and any special digging bonus it provides.
Your success depends on these factors and the strength of the wall:  granite is
very hard, quartz is hard, magma is soft, and rubble is very soft.
     As you get richer, the treasures in the wall won't seem so appealing
anymore, but keep an item or spell of tunneling handy.  Not only do all sorts of
special vaults lie deep below the surface, some completely enclosed by solid
rock, but smart adventurers deliberately alter the dungeon to make the most
dangerous breathers and summoners manageable.

Light:
     Your character must have some source of light in order to see, unless the
area around him is magically lit.  Depending on the items he has equipped, he
may have a light radius of one (torches with low fuel), two (a lantern or well-
fueled torch), or more, up to a rarely-attained maximum of five.  Never risk
being without light.
     A torch or lantern burns fuel, and may be refilled (use the 'F'uel command)
with other torches or flasks of oil respectively.  It is rumoured that other
light sources exist which never need replenishing.
     In addition you may get access to spells which permanently light up areas
of the dungeon; these can be truly handy, because a monster you can see coming
is much less dangerous.

Food and Regeneration:
     You must eat every so often in order to avoid starvation.  The speed at
which you consume food depends on your race (trolls need to eat a lot) and the
items your wear.  Your level of nutrition may have important effects.
 bloated  :  -10 speed, digestion very rapid
 full     :  no special effects
 normal   :  no special effects, no status display
 hungry   :  no special effects, a yellow warning appears
 weak     :  regeneration of mana and hitpoints halved
 fainting :  regeneration quartered, you faint away every so often
 starving :  no regeneration, fainting, damage taken every turn until death

     Never risk being without food.

     The speed at which you regenerate is doubled when you are resting (so rest
in place instead of staying in place whenever possible), and also affected by
various object attributes and temporary conditions.

Noise:
     Characters make a certain amount of noise all the time, which decreases as
stealth improves.  It is especially low when you are resting or sneaking.  Every
time you engage in combat, cast most kinds of spells that hurt monsters, bash a
door or a chest, kill a monster, or wreck the dungeon, you make extra noise,
which dies down again over time.
     Sleeping monsters will be disturbed by noise, especially if you are nearby
and are in line of sight.

Searching and Detection:
     There are two ways to find hidden area of the dungeon, doors, traps,
objects, and monsters; manual searching and magic.  At the beginning of the
game, you find everything manually.  If you suspect the existence of secret
doors or traps, you press 's' to search the grids around you for one turn.
Later on, you get access to objects and spells that do this for you, and very
handy they are.  The one thing that no magic spell can find for you is essences.

Level Feelings:
     Spend enough time on a given level and you will get a message describing
it.  The more interesting the choice of adjectives, the more dangerous and
lucrative the level is likely to be.  At the same time, the depth indicator
located at the bottom-right corner of the main screen will change color.  Whites
and yellows indicate relatively quiet levels, but reds and violets mean danger
and rewards.
     Things that boost level feelings include:  out of depth monsters (small
effect), out of depth uniques (larger effect), out of depth objects, certain
powerful object kinds, and very special rooms.
     You will occasionally get the message "You feel there is something special
about this level.", indicating the presence of a monster pit or nest (sometimes,
only at shallow depths), a vault (more often), a player ghost (always), or an
artifact (always).

Precognition Messages:
     If your perception skill is great enough, you will start to get
"precognition" messages indicating the presence of many of the individual
monsters, objects, and special rooms that boost level feelings.  Unlike level
feelings, they appear immediately.  The higher you raise this skill, the more
specific - and accurate - these messages become.


--- The Passage of Time ---

     Both monsters and characters gain energy each turn and use it to perform
actions.  Any creature that moves at normal speed gains 10 energy per game turn;
any monster move and most character actions take 100 energy.  Some monsters move
at double speed and you can too, if you quaff a Potion of Speed.  Actions still
take the same amount of energy, but they and you gain twice the energy each
turn.  Further down, monsters lurk that move even faster, and rare items exist
that enable you to keep pace.  If you can, avoid being slower than your foes.

An abbreviated speed-to-energy table:

(very slow creatures can get as little as 1 energy per turn)
  -20 speed:  3 energy
  -15      :  4
  -10      :  5
   -5      :  6
  normal   : 10
   +5      : 15
  +10      : 20
  +15      : 25
  +20      : 30
  +25      : 35
  +30      : 38 (energy only goes up very slowly above +30 speed)

Regeneration and recovery:
     Every 10 game turns, you regenerate some hitpoints and mana (unless you are
ill or wounded), and get hurt by cuts and poison.  Temporary conditions count
down, rods recharge, and light sources use fuel.  Every 100 game turns, you
digest some food.  Every hundred thousand game turns equals one day; the town
spends half that time in darkness and the other half in light.
     Every 10 game turns, every monster on the level gets a chance to recover
from all temporary conditions.  Every 100 game turns, they regenerate hitpoints.

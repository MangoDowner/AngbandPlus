
====== The Dungeon ======

--- Terrain ---

Rubble:
     Blocks movement, but is relatively easy to dig through.  Rubble may contain
hidden objects.

Permanent walls:
     You can dig through most walls but some are impenetrable.  The dungeon is
surrounded by these kinds of walls and some special rooms are made of them.

Staircases and shafts:
     Staircases allow your character to descend from one level to
another, and are represented by white ">". There are up stairs too but in 
Ironband you can never use them - you must always go deeper.
     Each level has at least two down staircases, unless it is the home of a 
special quest boss (levels 49 and 50), whom you must kill before
staircases will appear.  Otherwise, the staircases are guaranteed, but they may
be difficult to find.  Once you leave a level, you can never return to it. 

Secret doors:
     Many secret doors exist in the dungeon, and may lead to anything from a new
section of the dungeon level to an empty closet.  As your familiarity with the
dungeon grows, you will know where many secret doors are likely to be.  Secret
doors always look like granite until found.
     You find secret doors by using the 's'earch command, or by using some spells.

Traps:
     Traps also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal floor squares
until found, too often by your being caught by one.
     You find traps by using the 's'earch command, or by using some spells.

Runes:
     Runes also await you in the dungeon.  They look like normal floor squares
until they cast a spell at you.  Some runes are quite dangerous.

Rooms:
     The Pits of Angband contain many kinds of rooms, including some that house
hordes of monsters, contain extraordinary items, or are filled with deadly
traps.  Some special rooms, known as vaults, are extremely dangerous and
lucrative.

Mining:
     There is much treasure in the walls of the dungeon, just waiting for an
industrious adventurer to come and dig it out. Your ability to tunnel
depends on strength, weapon weight, and any special digging bonus it provides.
Your success depends on these factors and the strength of the wall:  granite is
very hard, quartz is hard, magma is soft, and rubble is very soft.
     As you get richer, the treasures in the wall won't seem so appealing
anymore, but keep an item or spell of tunneling handy.  Not only do all sorts of
special vaults lie deep below the surface, some completely enclosed by solid
rock, but smart adventurers deliberately alter the dungeon to make the most
dangerous breathers and summoners manageable.

--- Advanced Terrain Types ---

     In Ironband, there are levels that have lakes, forests, desert,
and many other types of terrain.  Entire dungeon levels can be themed after one
of these terrain types.

In general, when a player or creature is native to a terrain, they can move through
the terrain quicker.  Native creatures also have a combat advantage.  They tend to
be harder to hit, and get hits more frequently when battling non-native creatures.
When players or creatures are in terrain they are not native to, they take longer
to move through the terrain, and most likely will not be as effective in combat.
These advantages and disadvantages tend to be more extreme in deep terrain, or
thicker brush in forests. The player's Stealth can be affected by the terrain
they are in.

These terrains can be altered or negated by certain combat effects.  For example,
casting a fireball in a forest can start a forest fire that can hurt or kill monsters
and players, or burn the forest down to the ground.

The player and creatures can take damage when standing on certain terrain types.  A
common sense approach should be taken when entering these terrains.  For example,
all but the most powerful characters will die if they step in lava or any boiling
water, unless they have equipment or magic that makes them native to lava terrains.

In all instances below, creatures who are actively flying do not get the combat and
movement bonuses.

Forest:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to forests.
It can sometimes be burned by fire.  The player can suffer minor damage and cuts
walking through thick underbrush.

Sand:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to sand.
The player rarely will suffer damage by simply standing in sand based terrains.  Sand
based spells and magic are more powerful on sand based terrains.

Water:
     This terrain gives a significant combat and movement advantage to creatures
native to water.  The player rarely will suffer damage by simply standing in
water based terrains.  Cold based attacks can occasionally freeze water.  Water,
cold, ice, and electric based spells and magic are more powerful on water based
terrains.  Fire, sand, boiling mud, and boiling water based attacks are less
effective on water based terrains.

Boiling Water:
     All but the most powerful or magically protected adventurers will die instantly
when standing in boiling water.  This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to
creatures native to a combination of lava and water.  Lava, fire, boiling mud, and
boiling water based attacks are more effective on boiling water based terrains.  Water
and cold based spells and magic are less effective on boiling mud based terrains.

Mud:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to mud.
Unless it is boiling mud, the player rarely will suffer damage by simply standing
in mud based terrains.

Boiling Mud:
     All but the most powerful or magically protected adventurers will die instantly
when standing in boiling mud.  This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to
creatures native to a combination of lava and mud.  Lava, fire, boiling mud, and
boiling water based attacks are more effective on boiling mud based terrains.  Water
and cold based spells and magic are less effective on boiling mud based terrains.

Ice:
     This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to ice.
It can sometimes be melted by fire.  Ice and cold based spells and magic are more
powerful on ice based squares.  Water based spells and magic are less effective on ice
based terrains.

Oil:
     Includes oil and coal.  Native creatures have a significant combat and movement
advantage when fighting in Oil based terrains.  Most of this terrain type can
easily be set on fire.  Burning oil or coal will instantly kill most lower and
medium level characters and creatures who are standing on that square.

Acid:
     The player can take a significant amount of damage standing acid based squares.
This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to acid.  Acid
based spells and magic are more powerful on acid based squares.

Lava:
     All but the most powerful or magically protected adventurers will die instantly
when standing in lava.  This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to
creatures native to lava.  Lava can sometimes be cooled by cold based spells.  Lava,
fire, boiling mud, and boiling water based attacks are more effective on lava based
terrains.  Water, cold, and ice based spells and magic are less effective on lava
based terrains.

Fire:
     The player can take a significant amount of damage standing fire based squares.
This terrain gives a combat and movement advantage to creatures native to lava.  Fire
based spells and magic are more powerful on fire based square.  Lava, fire, boiling
mud, and boiling water based attacks are more effective on fire based terrains.  Cold,
based spells and magic are less effective on lava based terrains.  Fires
can sometimes be extinguished by water or cold based spells.


The player retains all information they have observed about terrain.  To access this
information, go to the knowledge screens (press'~') and go to the terrain knowledge
section.


Inscriptions:
     On dungeon walls you will find inscriptions that will give you hints as to
the type of creatures that exist on the level.  Some inscriptions are dangerous
and may harm the player under certain circumstances.


--- Exploring ---

Light:
     Your character must have some source of light in order to see, unless the
area around him is magically lit.  Depending on his Perception and the items he 
has equipped, he may have a light radius of one (a torch), two (a lantern), or 
more, up to a rarely-attained maximum of five.  Try to avoid being without 
light.
     A torch or lantern burns fuel, and may be refilled (use the 'F'uel command)
with other torches or flasks of oil respectively.  It is rumoured that other
light sources exist which never need replenishing.
     In addition you may get access to spells which permanently light up areas
of the dungeon; these can be truly handy, because a monster you can see coming
is much less dangerous.

Food and Regeneration:
     Never risk being without food.  You must eat every so often in order to
avoid starvation.  The speed at which you consume food depends on your race
(half-trolls need to eat a lot) and the items you wear.
     The speed at which you regenerate is doubled when you are resting (so rest
in place instead of staying in place whenever possible), and is also affected by
various object attributes and temporary conditions.

Stealth:
     The higher your Stealth, and the further away you are, the less you disturb
the rest of sleeping monsters.

Searching and Detection:
     There are two ways to find hidden areas of the dungeon, doors, traps,
objects, and monsters; manual searching and magic.  At the beginning of the
game, you find everything manually.  If you suspect the existence of secret
doors or traps, press 's' to search the grids around you for one turn.  Later
on, you get access to objects and spells that do this for you, and very handy
they are.

Level Feelings:
     If you have spent enough time on the level, you will get a feeling
about that level.  The more interesting the choice of adjectives, the more
dangerous and lucrative the level is likely to be.
     Things that boost level feelings include:  out of depth monsters, out of
depth uniques, out of depth objects, certain powerful object kinds, very
special rooms, and chests.

Preserve Mode:
     If you do not have preserve mode on, you will occasionally get the message
"You feel there is something special about this level.", indicating the presence
of a monster pit or nest, a vault, or an artifact.
     However, turning preserve mode off also means that artifacts are created
only once; they will never appear again.  You can check the artifacts that have
been found or lost by using the knowledge '~' menu.


--- The Passage of Time ---

     Both monsters and characters gain energy each turn and use it to perform
actions.  Any creature that moves at normal speed gains 10 energy per game turn;
any monster move and most character actions take 100 energy.  Some monsters move
at double speed and you can too, if you quaff a Potion of Speed.  Actions still
take the same amount of energy, but they and you gain twice the energy each
turn.  Further down, monsters lurk that move even faster, and rare items exist
that enable you to keep pace.  If you can, avoid being slower than your foes.

An abbreviated speed-to-energy table:

(very slow creatures can get as little as 1 energy per turn)
     -20 speed:  3 energy
     -15      :  4
     -10      :  5
      -5      :  6
     normal   : 10
      +5      : 15
     +10      : 20
     +15      : 25
     +20      : 30
     +25      : 35
     +30      : 38 (energy only goes up very slowly above +30 speed)

Regeneration and recovery:
     Every 10 game turns, you regenerate some hitpoints (unless you are
ill or wounded), and get hurt by cuts and poison.  Temporary conditions count
down and light sources use fuel.  Every 100 game turns, you
digest some food.  
     Every time it takes a turn, every monster aware of you recovers from
temporary conditions.  Every 100 game turns, they regenerate hitpoints.
     In Ironband, unlike other *bands, you do not regenerate mana over time.
Instead, take the stairs down to recover all your mana.

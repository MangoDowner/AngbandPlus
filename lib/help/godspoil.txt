#####RThe Beginner's Guide to Gods and Goddesses

#####G1.  Introduction
        Everybody likes to have a little helping hand now and then.  What
could be better than having a god on your side?  But it's not quite that easy.
The gods won't help just any mortal who calls for help.  You have to give them
a little something too.

#####G2.  How Do I Get in on This?
        First of all, find an altar.  They're found just laying around in the
dungeon.  Then offer a sacrifice.  Make sure you're certain you want to
worship this god, they don't take rejection very well.  There are other things
you can do with an altar.  If you worship another god, bashing an altar has a
%10 chance of converting it, a %40 chance of getting you zapped, and the rest
of the time nothing happens.  An atheist has an even chance of nothing
happening and getting fried.  Don't bash your own altar.  Just trust me.

#####G3.  So, Who Are These Gods?

        but aggravate monsters.  Above 5,000 grace they can see invisible and

        emit light.
[[[[[BThe RNG (randomness):]  
        All followers have their stats modified by +-3.

Any god has the ability to resurrect their followers, if they feel them worthy
of the honor.  But such a gift is only granted rarely, and the gods are
grudgeful of such favors, with a cost of 140,000 grace when it is done.

#####G4.  How Do I Get on Their Good Side?
	Sacrifice items at their altars.  The more expensive, the better.
Sacrificing to the wrong god loses 10*(it's value in gold) from grace and
decreases your wisdom If (value in gold)>2500 then you are  converted to the
new god. You lose all previous grace, but your new god counts the converting
sacrifice towards your grace.

#####G5.  I'm in Trouble.  What Do I Do?
        Pray.  Your relationship with your god is measured by two numbers,
your grace and your favor.  Grace is increased by sacrifices, favor is
increased by praying.  Favor is actually a measure of how much you've bothered
your god, so you want it to be as low as possible.  It will slowly decrease
over time.  The chance of your prayer being answered is roughly dependant on
the difference between grace and favor.  Paladins and priests receive a bonus
when praying.

If your grace is high enough (the way it is calculated makes it hard to say
exactly, with a 0 favor it requires at least -10,000), and your down to 1/10
of your HP, and you pray, your god will choose a benefit from the lesser list
of gifts.  These are:
Summoning a friendly monster (9% chance)
Teleport away monsters (radius 9, 1/10 chance)
Get healed (level d 20 HP) and all negative conditions are healed (1/10 chance)
Get healed (level d 40 HP) and all negative conditions are healed (1/10 chance)
A radius 9 sea of runes appears (1/10 chance)
A radius 6 magic missile ball attacks (1/10 chance)
A radius 8 Word of Destruction is cast (1/10 chance)
A radius 9 magic missile ball attack is cast (1/10 chance)
All monsters in LOS are hit with magic missiles (1%)

If your grace is really high, over 5,000 with no favor, you get something even
better:
If you are at less than 40% HP or 20% SP, the worse of the two is fixed
After that, there is a %50 percent chance of a god specific gift.
[[[[[BYavanna:] summons Ents
[[[[[BUlmo:] Flood
[[[[[BAule:] Alter Reality
[[[[[BMelkor:] Darkness storm
[[[[[BTilion, Arien, Varda:] Wizard light
[[[[[BTulkas:] Invulnerability
[[[[[BManwe:] Mass genocide
[[[[[BEru:] mimicking a vala
[[[[[BRNG:] your stats shuffled around (50% chance to boost or lower each stat).

If that doesn't happen, your gift is chosen from the list below:
Summon friendly monsters (9%)
Acquirement (10%)
*Enchant armor* (10%)
*Enchant weapon* (10%)
Sea of runes forms around you (10%)
Recharge an item (10%)
Curse removal (10%)
*Identify* (10%)
Full recuperation and alter reality(10%)
Increase all stats (1%)

#####G6.  My God is Mad.  Help!
        Your grace naturally decreases over time, depending on which god you
worship.  If you pray when your grace is too low, or when your favor is too
high, you can find yourself in a lot of trouble.  The only solution is to
rebuild your grace with sacrifices and to let your favor decrease.

The amounts that grace decreases are:

[[[[[BYavanna, Eru:] 3 grace/50 turns
[[[[[BUlmo, Aule, Arien:] 4 grace/50 turns
[[[[[BTilion, Varda:] 5 grace/50 turns
[[[[[BManwe:] 6 grace/50 turns
[[[[[BTulkas:] 9 grace/50 turns
[[[[[BMelkor, The RNG:] 10 grace/50 turns

The Beginner's Guide to Gods and Goddesses

1.  Introduction
        Everybody likes to have a little helping hand now and then.  What
could be better than having a god on your side?  But it's not quite that easy.
The gods won't help just any mortal who calls for help.  You have to give them
a little something too.

2.  How Do I Get in on This?
        First of all, find an altar.  They're found just laying around in the
dungeon.  Then offer a sacrifice.  Make sure you're certain you want to
worship this god, they don't take rejection very well.  There are other things
you can do with an altar.  If you worship another god, bashing an altar has a
%10 chance of converting it, a %40 chance of getting you zapped, and the rest
of the time nothing happens.  An atheist has an even chance of nothing
happening and getting fried.  Don't bash your own altar.  Just trust me.

3.  So, Who Are These Gods?

Yavanna (trees): All followers are cold resistant.  Above 10,000 grace they
        become immune to cold.

        grace they regenerate quickly and above 10,000 grace they become
        resistant to shards.
Melkor (darkness):  All followers resist darkness, have their strenght and
        constitution sustained, and are resistant to life draining attacks,
        but aggravate monsters.  Above 5,000 grace they can see invisible and
        are telepathic.  Above 10,000 grace they resist chaos and
        disenchantment.
Tilion (moon):  All followers emit light.  Above 5,000 grace they resist

        and above 10,000 grace they gain regeneration.
Tulkas (rage):  All of his followers gain permanant super heroism.  Above
        5,000 grace his followers gain a point in dexterity and strength.
        Above 10,000 grace his followers gain free action, resist blindness,
        and resist confusion.

        blindness, confusion, and fear.
Eru (being):  All followers regenerate and emit light, and gain 15 points each
        of wisdom, dexterity, and charisma, but they lose 50 on their to-hit
        and to-damage.
The RNG (randomness):  All followers have slow metabolisms and have their
        stats changed by +/- 3. At 5,000 piety they resist poison and at
        10,000 piety they resist sound.

Any god has the ability to resurrect their followers, if they feel them worthy
of the honor.  But such a gift is only granted rarely, and the gods are
grudgeful of such favors, with a cost of 140,000 grace when it is done.

4.  How Do I Get on Their Good Side?
	Sacrifice items at their altars.  The more expensive, the better.
Sacrificing to the wrong god loses 10*(it's value in gold) from grace and
decreases your wisdom If (value in gold)>2500 then you are  converted to the
new god. You lose all previous grace, but your new god counts the converting
sacrifice towards your grace.

5.  I'm in Trouble.  What Do I Do?
        Pray.  Your relationship with your god is measured by two numbers,
your grace and your favor.  Grace is increased by sacrifices, favor is
increased by praying.  Favor is actually a measure of how much you've bothered
your god, so you want it to be as low as possible.  It will slowly decrease
over time.  The chance of your prayer being answered is roughly dependant on
the difference between grace and favor.  Paladins, priests, and priors all
receive a bonus when praying.

If your grace is high enough (the way it is calculated makes it hard to say
exactly, with a 0 favor it requires at least -10,000), and your down to 1/10
of your HP, and you pray, your god will choose a benefit from the lesser list
of gifts.  These are:
Summoning a friendly monster (9% chance)
Teleport away monsters (radius 9, 1/10 chance)
Get healed (level d 20 HP) and all negative conditions are healed (1/10 chance)
Get healed (level d 40 HP) and all negative conditions are healed (1/10 chance)
A radius 9 sea of runes appears (1/10 chance)
A radius 6 magic missile ball attacks (1/10 chance)
A radius 8 Word of Destruction is cast (1/10 chance)
A radius 9 magic missile ball attack is cast (1/10 chance)
All monsters in LOS are hit with magic missiles (1%)

If your grace is really high, over 5,000 with no favor, you get something even
better:
If you are at less than 40% HP or 20% SP, the worse of the two is fixed
After that, there is a %50 percent chance of a god specific gift.
Yavanna: summons Ents
Ulmo: Flood
Aule: Alter Reality
Melkor: Darkness storm
Tilion, Arien, Varda: Wizard light
Tulkas: Invulnerability
Manwe: Mass genocide
Eru: mimicing a valar
RNG: your stats shuffled around

If that doesn't happen, your gift is chosen from the list below:
Summon friendly monsters (9%)
Acquirement (10%)
*Enchant armor* (10%)
*Enchant weapon* (10%)
Sea of runes forms around you (10%)
Recharge an item (10%)
Curse removal (10%)
*Identify* (10%)
Full recuperation and alter reality(10%)
Increase all stats (1%)

6.  My God is Mad.  Help!
        Your grace naturally decreases over time, depending on which god you
worship.  If you pray when your grace is too low, or when your favor is too
high, you can find yourself in a lot of trouble.  The only solution is to
rebuild your grace with sacrifices and to let your favor decrease.

The amounts that grace decreases are:

Yavanna, Illuvatar: 3 grace/50 turns
Ulmo, Aule, Arien : 4 grace/50 turns
Tilion, Varda: 5 grace/50 turns
Manwe: 6 grace/50 turns
Tulkas: 9 grace/50 turns
Melkor, The RNG: 10 grace/50 turns

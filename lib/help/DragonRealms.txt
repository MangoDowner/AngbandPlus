[[[[B|  Dragon Realms

  Dragons are magical creatures and may choose to learn a particular branch of
  dragon magic. Unlike normal spell casters, dragons do not need spell books to
  cast or learn powers. Instead, they simply gain spells as they mature. Each
  realm of dragon magic has a direct impact on the player's stats and skills,
  and each realm also requires a different stat for casting purposes.


***** <Lore>
[[[[r|  Lore

  Dragons specializing in lore are seekers of knowledge. They are the most
  intelligent of dragonkind and use their vast intellects to drive their magic.
  Armed with a vast array of detection and knowledge spells, dragons of lore
  seek power through knowledge. They eventually gain powers of telepathy and
  automatic object identification. Lore dragons are quick learners and gain
  maturity much more rapidly than the rest of their kind.


***** <Breath>
[[[[r|  Breath

  Dragon breath is the stuff of legends, and this realm seeks to enhance this
  most powerful attribute of dragonkind. With this speciality, you will be able
  to shape and control your breaths to maximize deadliness for a given
  situation. In addition, dragons of this realm may choose their breath types
  if applicable, and breathing becomes less costly as they mature. This focus
  requires great fortitude to master and somewhat diminishes the dragon's
  defenses and melee.


***** <Attack>
[[[[r|  Attack

  Attack dragons seek melee supremacy above all else. This realm offers
  powerful attack spells to support a race that is already among the melee
  elite, and the result can be truly awe-inspiring. With this realm, the dragon
  may rend their opponents with extra sharp claws, may snatch an adjacent
  opponent in their powerful jaws and then toss them about like a rag doll, and
  may even augment their bite attacks with their breath element! Truly, a
  rampaging dragon is an awe inspiring sight, one that is seldom witnessed (or
  perhaps seldom survived?). This focus values strength above all else.


***** <Craft>
[[[[r|  Craft

  The most powerful magical items have long been believed forged by
  dragonflame. The craft dragon gains powers of enchantment and may even
  reforge artifacts into the objects of their choosing! Otherwise, craft
  dragons are not particularly powerful as they trade melee and breath prowess
  for magical understanding. This focus requires great wisdom to master.


***** <Armor>
[[[[r|  Armor

  Dragon scales have thwarted many a would be dragonslayer. Naturally tough and
  resistant, the dragon's armor is even further enhanced by this realm. This
  specialization gives enhanced armor class, reflection, resistance to cuts and
  stunning, resistance to poison and life draining, and sustaining of several
  key stats, albeit not all at once. With all of these extra innate bonuses,
  the magic spells of this realm are few in number but serve to offer temporary
  defensive augmentations. Unlike their kin, dragons of this order prize
  agility above all else.


***** <Domination>
[[[[r|  Domination

  All dragons have a formidable presence and make fearsome opponents. But
  Domination dragons are truly a breed apart seeking to bend and control the
  will of all they meet. Convinced of their right to rule, these dragons may
  subjugate the weak, terrify the uncertain, and stun the unwary with their
  awesome presence. They are the best dragons at controlling minions and can
  summon mighty aid. Enemy monsters summoned to battle may switch sides when
  they notice whom they have been commanded to fight. And in the end, the
  dragon of domination may sever all oaths of allegiance, returning enemy
  summons to where they came. Needless to say, dragons of this order value
  force of will above all else.


***** <Crusade>
[[[[r|  Crusade

  Crusade dragons are on a mission to destroy the forces of evil. As such, this
  realm is only available to Gold Dragons and Law Dragons. Being of a single
  focus, the Crusade dragon is not as powerful in melee or breaths as other
  dragons, but their spells more than make up for this deficit. At least
  against evil opponents. For one thing, Crusade dragons can breathe holy
  elements not normally accessible. At the sight of evil, they become enraged
  and may haste for battle. They can even heal a bit and ultimately they may
  smite the forces of evil with holy power, both in melee and in breath. Strong
  in personality, dragons of this order may summon like minded kin for the
  final battles.


***** <Death>
[[[[r|  Death

  Death dragons are enemies of life itself, seeking to destroy all living
  creatures. With this realm, the dragon may bend their breath weapon to suit
  their necromantic desires, eventually breathing mastery over both death and
  life. At high levels, the death dragon's melee attacks gain a powerful
  draining effect against living creatures. This focus values strength above
  all else. This foul realm is only available to Shadow and Chaos dragons.

#####R=== Alchemists ===

#####GDescription
Alchemists are the only class that can harness the abilities of the 
essences found in the dungeon. They can add these essences to staves, 
rings, wands, rods, and sometimes weapons and armor to create new items
or recharge old ones. They can also extract essences from magical items
they find. Using these abilities, Alchemists can get very good items at
low levels. The trouble is getting them to survive later on.

Alchemists are extremely proficient with all kinds of magical devices,
and have made a fine art of extracting, storing, and using these 
objects' magical energies.  Because they neither fight well nor cast 
powerful spells, alchemists rely on their craftsmenship to cope with 
the dangers of the dungeons.  They will quickly learn to create damage-
dealing wands, rods, and staffs, forge powerful weapons and armour, 
make highly useful objects of other kinds, and eventually will 
understand the perilous art of artifact creation itself.

#####GMagic Usage
[[[[[BThe alchemic techniques are accessed using the 'm' key.]  An
alchemist may then 'E'xtract power or 'A'dd power. The Alchemist [[[[[vmust]
be wearing GLOVES to use their alchemy powers.

Alchemist's are also capable of [[[[[Bcreating their own artifacts], but
this is a time-consuming, though rewarding, activity. To do so, they
need to imbue a normal (non-ego/non-artifact) item with a number of
essences of magic (equal to their character level) and then wield the 
item. While using the item, it will gain experience (which reduces the
amount of exp the wearer gains during this time). When the alchemist 
feels that the item is powerful enough,  they can finalise the artifact
by "buying" powers using the experience the artifact has collected.

Many (but not all) potions, scrolls, wands, staffs, rods, rings, and 
amulets contain useable magical energies.  An alchemist taps that 
energy, using the technique "'E'xtract power" to create one or more
essences of a type appropriate to the original object.

The drained object itself is now called "of nothing".  Unlike any
other kind of object, it can have new magics added to it.

An alchemist can add power to such items by using essences he made 
or found.  He does this with the technique "'A'dd power".  He
can then select a kind of essence, then the object he wishes to
restore magic to.  If he has enough essences, and the object does
not already have magics in it, the alchemy succeeds.

[[[[[BA few pointers:]
     -Recipes are (usually) logical. Acid essences don't make Dragon 
      Weapons.
     -Not all objects or ego-item types can be made using alchemy.
     -Alchemy is partially reversible.  Anything but weapons and armour 
      that can be enchanted using essences will also create them 
      if drained, but extra wand and staff charges have no effect.

[[[[[BSome Recipes:]
Any alchemist worth his salt knows lots of recipes.  Here are some to 
get the beginner started, and others may be discovered by trial and 
error (or read about in the *****essences.txt*0[Essences SPOILER]).

     Essences of Acid:
          8 essences + any ordinary weapon = acid branding
          8 essences + Ring of Nothing = Ring of Acid
          2 essences + Wand of Nothing = Wand of Acid Bolts
          2 essences + Wand of Acid Bolts = one additional charge
          5 essences + Rod of Nothing = Rod of Acid Bolts
          1 essence  + Scroll of Nothing = Scroll of Curse Armour
          2 essences + Amulet of Nothing = Amulet of Resist Acid

#####GStarting Equipment
An alchemist begins the game with:
    A small sword
    An essense of explosion
    An empty bottle
    Leather gloves
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:
    a rod tip of nothing

#####R=== Necromancers ===

#####GDescription
As a Priest devotes his life to his chosen deity, so Necromancers 
devote their lives to the study of death. Familiar with all of the 
forms of unbeing, they are able to cast spells from the Nether realm 
with great effect. Moreover, if and when they die, they can send out 
their spirit to avenge their enemies and drain their life force. If 
enough beings are so drained, the Necromancer may return to life. On 
the other hand, a Necromancer can only maintain the force of will
required to animate his spirit for a limited time. If they do not 
manage to return to the realm of the living before their willpower 
gives out, death becomes permanent. 

#####GPrimary Stats

#####GMagic Usage
Necromancers have very special powers (activated by 'U') and can use 
the *****m_nether.txt*0[Nether] Realm. They may learn 64 spell levels.

But their most special ability is that they can survive their own death.
A necromancer when killed become an undead, slowly rotting away and 
must kill a certain amount of monsters to drain life from them to come 
back to life. If he/she dies in the undead form then he/she permanently
dies.

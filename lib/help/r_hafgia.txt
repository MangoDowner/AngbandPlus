#####R=== Half-Giants ===

#####GDescription
Half-Giants are not too unusual, as there has been a tradition marking it 
as a noble and brave thing to consort a giant (especially a giant-maid). 
Nevertheless, the offspring of such a union is seldom popular in the world
of men. Their limited intelligence makes it impossible for them to become 
full spellcasters, but with their huge strength they make excellent 
warriors. They also love to wander in the wilderness, and can become 
rangers. No ordinary wall can withstand the fury of a giant, or a half-
giant, and at higher levels they can learn the power of magical digging. 
Their thick skin makes them resistant to shards, and like Half-Ogres and 
Half-Trolls, they have their strength sustained.

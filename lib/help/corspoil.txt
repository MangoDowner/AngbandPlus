#####R=== ToME Corruptions Spoiler ===

Sometimes adventurers become exposed to the dark powers of Morgoth. If they 
are unable to resist these powers, they become corrupted. Corruptions can 
change their physical or mental abilities, some of which can be good, and
some bad. Most corruptions will affect you permanently, although some only 
operate when they are activated (whether by player choice or as a random 
event). You can check which corruptions do you have in the knowledge screen 
6 (accessed through the '~' menu) or in a character dump.

#####GGaining and losing corruptions
There are many ways how to gain or lose corruptions.

You can select the *****rm_corru.txt*0[corrupted race] on birth. Such foul
adventurers will gain and lose corruptions as they gain experience and
levels. The same applies to characters with the 'Chaos deities give you
gifts' corruption. There is a 1 in 3 chance to lose a corruption instead
of gaining it on these occasions.

You can become corrupted by quaffing a Potion of Corruption or by drinking
from Fountain of Corruption. Also some strange items can be activated
for corruption.

There is 1 in 3 chance you will get corrupted when hit by a chaos attack 
while lacking a source of chaos resistance.

If you have attracted the attention of a chaos deity, you have 1 in 6 chance
to be rewarded by being given a corruption when you gain an experience level.

You can also gain and lose corruptions when polymorphing yourself.

[[[[[BQuaffing a potion of New Life cures all your corruptions]. Also some strange 
items activate for curing all corruptions.

In general, corruptions are gained randomly. But there are two notable
exceptions. If you are a Vampire, you have a 70% chance to gain the 'Your gaze
is hypnotic' corruption if you don't already have it. If you have studied the
symbiotic skill, you have 70% chance to gain the 'You can cause mold to grow 
near you' corruption. Also, some corruptions override each other - you cannot 
be Superhumanly strong (+4 Strength) with Puny Muscles (-4 Strength)!

#####GList of corruptions
The chance of any random corruption activating is measured against player 
turns with the player at normal (+0) speed. The chance of gaining a 
particular corruption is expressed in parentheses after corruption's name.

#####GQ: How do I use the altars (the 'O's) I see in the dungeon?

A: PernAngband introduces a new system of gods. Each god has one
dedicated altar. At the beginning of the game, only Priests, Priors
and Paladins worship a god.  Everyone else may choose if they
want to or not. Sacrifice ('O' key while on an altar) good objects
often enough to your chosen god and he/she will grant you
special favors as appropriate for that god. But beware! If you don't 
sacrifice often enough your god will eventually get angry and punish 
you. Also, when you have a religion it's difficult and dangerous to 
change to another, so choose wisely.

You can also try to bash altars of other gods to convert them,
but it's rather dangerous. 
You can press 'p' to pray to your god if you're in good grace with
him/her.

You should also read gods.txt in the help directory (and godspoil.txt if you
want heavy spoilers). Both files are linked from the spoiler.hlp file.

#####GQ: Why do I have -195 to hit and to damage ?

A: Because you are a Sorcerer. They can't effectively use weapons, (apart
from Mage Staves), and even bare-handed they are very bad.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I've found some strange items like a Red Tome, a Voodoo Doll, ...
#####G   What can I do with them?

A: You've found an unusual artifact that cannot be wielded, but always
has a sometimes-useful activation.  It will not be listed in the known
artifact list and its activation is chosen randomly. It would probably be
wise for this kind of artifact be *identified* before use, as the
activation can be something like death, stat loss, ...

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I spent 500 gp at the Prophet but she said nothing. Is that a bug ?

A: No. Nor is it because Prophets are swindlers. She said nothing
because you have no fate at this moment.  You gain fate while playing, and
will be warned by a message such as "You feel your fate has changed".  A fate
can be useless like finding a broken skull at level 30, deadly like dying at
level 56, or really useful like to never die by the hand of a mortal.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: Who is Mathilde, the Science Student whom I see every so often in the
#####G   town?

A: Most of the time she laughs and giggles, she has no loot on her, and
she's never done you any harm. So leave her be - even if she should
happen to shout "Drop dead, creep!".

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: My wrists hurt a lot when playing the game. Should I take precautions?

A: Yes, you should. Repetitive strain on wrists (which results from a badly
placed keyboard, for example) can lead to serious injury of the wrist
ligaments called Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. If you feel your wrists
are strained, here is an exercise posted by Jason Maskell in 
rec.games.roguelike.angband which might help:

Hold your arms out horizontally, make a fist, and then point
the fist towards the floor, as much as you can. This will
stretch one side's tendons. Hold for 5 seconds. Then make a
flat hand and hold it level with your arm, hold for 5 seconds.
Now splay your fingers and attempt to make your hand point
toward the ceiling (this one is hard, so don't push it too
much). You should feel your tendons stretching. Repeat this a
few times. Take frequent breaks and do this if it starts to hurt
a little bit. I was sliding very fast towards CTS and this
corrected it.

#####GQ: When I stand on between gates I'm never teleported away, what's wrong ?

A: Between gates are no longer automatic. You must press '>' while standing
on one to activate it

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: When it panic saves it reloads an old savefile !!

A: Now the panic saves use a different file to save, savefile.pnc
This file will be loaded first, if present, when the game is started.
If it loads successfully, save the game immediately. Otherwise, delete
the panic save, and your old (non-panic) savefile should be safe.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: The game is so slow...

A: Yeah :(
Try disabling the various options marked as (slow)

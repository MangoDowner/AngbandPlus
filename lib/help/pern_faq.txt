#####R=== Differences Between T.o.M.E. and Vanilla Angband ===

The first main difference a new player to T.o.M.E. will need to be aware of
is that the main dungeon from Angband has been split into 4 "dungeons", each 
of which cover a different portion of the dungeon's levels. Each of these 4 
dungeons are located either in or near one of the four main towns so that the 
character can keep stocked up on supplies. As the adventurer advances in 
ability, they will need to travel overland to the next town/dungeon, which is 
most easily carried out using the wilderness map ("<" from town level). As well 
as these main places, there are a number of additional dungeons which the 
character may or may not choose to enter, which can have guardians, contain 
specific artifacts, or just be used as an alternative place to enjoy gaining 
experience. Note that not all of the places are actually "dungeons" - some are
caves, forests, etc.

T.o.M.E. also offers the player the ability to undertake a series of quests. 
Random quests can be specified during start-up, and involve rescuing a princess 
from a group of monsters within the dungeon. If you do not wish to play with 
random quests, simply specify "0" when asked how many you want during character 
generation. Other "fixed" quests are also available from the towns (whether 
random quests are enabled or not), usually given by the town leaders upon the 
request of the adventurer. It is not required for any adventurer to undertake 
the fixed quests, but they can result in some nice rewards.

The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and T.o.M.E. is the 
greatly expanded choice in character classes and races, as well as an expanded 
magic system. Many races/classes can also have special abilities, which can be 
accessed through the "U" command. This gives a starting adventurer the ability 
to find a character that suits their own personal playing style.

To balance the expansion in things like player abilities and customisation, the 
list of both monsters and items has also been expanded. Be warned that items 
which were by default safe in Vanilla are not necessarily safe in T.o.M.E. (a 
certain early artifact comes to mind here . . . ), and picking on defenceless 
creatures is frowned upon....

Happy 'Banding!

#####GQ: How do I turn off Graphics in the Windows version?

A: Select Options -> Graphics from the top menu bar, and then unselect the 
current graphics. This sets the game back to using the IBM psuedo graphics.
However, many people prefer to use pure ASCII - to do this, rename or remove
the font-win.prf frile in your lib/pref folder. Once the game can no longer 
see this file where it expects to, it will default back to pure ASCII.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: How do I use the altars (the 'O's) I see in the dungeon?

A: T.o.M.E. introduces a new system of gods. Each god has one dedicated 
altar. At the beginning of the game, only Priests, Priors and Paladins worship 
a god.  Everyone else may choose if they want to or not. Sacrifice ('O' key 
while on an altar) good objects often enough to your chosen god and he/she will
grant you special favors as appropriate for that god. But beware! If you don't 
sacrifice often enough your god will eventually get angry and punish you. Also,
when you have a religion it's difficult and dangerous to change to another, so 
choose wisely.

You can also try to bash altars of other gods to convert them, but it's rather 
dangerous. You can press 'p' to pray to your god if you're in good grace with
him/her.

You should also read *****gods.txt*0[gods.txt] in the help directory (and *****godspoil.txt*0[godspoil.txt] if you
want heavy spoilers).

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: How do I use the fountains (the '_'s) I see in the dungeon?

A: Fountains in T.o.M.E. act like potions, but can only be identified by 
drinking from them. Each one can hold between 3 and 12 doses of the potion. 
Quaffing from a fountain can be done by using the 'H' command (in the standard 
keyset).

You can also fill empty bottles at a fountain (enabling you to identify the 
potion and hence the type of fountain) by using the 'H' command, but instead of
chosing 'y' to quaff, type 'n'. The game will then ask you what bottle to fill.


#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: Why do I have -195 to hit and to damage ?

A: Because you are a Sorcerer. They can't effectively use weapons, (apart
from Mage Staves), and even bare-handed they are very bad.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I got killed by a Great Wyrm of Power at 50'!!! What happened?

A: You killed a defenceless creature. I told you that it was frowned upon!

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I've found some strange items like a Red Tome, a Voodoo Doll, ...
#####G   What can I do with them?

A: You've found an unusual artifact that cannot be wielded, but always
has a sometimes-useful activation.  It will not be listed in the known
artifact list and its activation is chosen randomly. It would probably be
wise for this kind of artifact be *identified* before use, as the
activation can be something like death, stat loss, ...

To activate it, use the normal Activation command, but when prompted for which 
item to activate change to the backpack instead of wielded equipment.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I spent 500 gp at the Prophet but she said nothing. Is that a bug ?

A: No. Nor is it because Prophets are swindlers. She said nothing
because you have no fate at this moment.  You gain fate while playing, and
will be warned by a message such as "You feel your fate has changed".  A fate
can be useless like finding a broken skull at level 30, deadly like dying at
level 56, or really useful like to never die by the hand of a mortal.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: Who is Mathilde, the Science Student whom I see every so often in the
#####G   town?

A: Most of the time she laughs and giggles, she has no loot on her, and
she's never done you any harm. So leave her be - even if she should
happen to shout "Drop dead, creep!".

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: My wrists hurt a lot when playing the game. Should I take precautions?

A: Yes, you should. Repetitive strain on wrists (which results from a badly
placed keyboard, for example) can lead to serious injury of the wrist ligaments
called Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. If you feel your wrists are strained, here is 
an exercise posted by Jason Maskell in rec.games.roguelike.angband which might 
help:

Hold your arms out horizontally, make a fist, and then point the fist towards 
the floor, as much as you can. This will stretch one side's tendons. Hold for 
5 seconds. Then make a flat hand and hold it level with your arm, hold for 5 
seconds. Now splay your fingers and attempt to make your hand point toward the 
ceiling (this one is hard, so don't push it too much). You should feel your 
tendons stretching. Repeat this a few times. Take frequent breaks and do this 
if it starts to hurt a little bit. I was sliding very fast towards CTS and this
corrected it.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: When I stand on between gates I'm never teleported away, what's wrong?

A: Between gates are no longer automatic. You must press '>' while standing
on one to activate it. However, the place "between" is bitterly cold!

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: When it panic saves it reloads an old savefile !!

A: Now the panic saves use a different file to save, savefile.pnc
This file will be loaded first, if present, when the game is started.
If it loads successfully, save the game immediately. Otherwise, delete
the panic save, and your old (non-panic) savefile should be safe.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I'm in the Maze, but I cannot find Merton!

A: Merton appears on a *random* level between dungeon level 26 (1300') and
36 (1800'). Each maze level is one panel by one panel in size, but *full* of
passageways - so you may have to do quite a bit of tunnelling to search the
whole level.

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I've found Merton, now what?

A: There is a new command that has been added to T.o.M.E. that allows you to
pass objects to creatures. What would you try and do if you had a broken leg
and needed to get home?

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: I'm trying to find the Poisoned water quest at Lothlorien, but cannot
#####G   find the quest entrance!

A: This quest is located in the wilderness. To the east of Lothlorien is 4 
water squares in an upside down L shape. One of these squares will contain the
quest. (Viewed from the Wilderness map).

#####G------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####GQ: The game is so slow...

A: Yeah :(
Try disabling the various options marked as (slow)

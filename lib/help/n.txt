KOBOLD
--------

Kobolds are small green creatures, similar to a goblin.
Weak, repulsive, stinky, vicious are all words that fits to
describe a kobold. Kobolds are quick and stealthy, but they
are weak, frail and other races tend to shun them for the
mere fact that they are weak and repulsive. They generally
hide in filthy areas, and as such have acquired a natural
resistance to poison.

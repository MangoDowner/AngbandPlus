DEMON
-------

Demons of any kind are usually attacked on sight by most races, save 
from the citizens of Rhyzendal, the fiendish population of the cold 
kingdom. Looking humanoid in appearance, the citizens of Rhyzendal 
generally have grey skin, large demon wings, short horns and a tail, 
the most common appearance of the lesser demons which have been 
summoned from the upper planes of hell. While no longer bound to the 
evil of hell, and trying to become more peaceful, the demons of 
Rhyzendal have not lost their persuasive and seductive manners, and 
since they are known to be intelligent and cunning, other kingdoms 
do not trust them, and are highly hesistant to trade with them, 
preferring to leave them alone in their kingdom.

Demons can be described as the dark counterparts of celestials. 
Though living in the civilized world of Portralis turned them away 
from their evil origins, they are still the masters of darkness in 
Portralis, and no races matches their dark powers. They are also 
completely immune to the effect of the dark. Of course, being 
impregnated with darkness means they are extremely susceptible to 
light. Demons once lived in the flaming planes of hell, and were 
once immune to the effects of fire, but after living for centuries in 
the frozen kingdom of Rhyzendal, they have lost some of their resistance 
to fire, while gaining some resistance to cold. Demons are intelligent 
and persuasive, and these are the main reasons why they are not trusted 
by anyone.

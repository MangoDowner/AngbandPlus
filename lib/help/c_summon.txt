#####R=== Summoner ===

#####GDescription
A Summoner is, with one exception, a fairly weak class. While he starts 
out a decent enough fighter, his fighting skill doesn't improve at all, 
as well as some of the worst object lore abilities known to man, no 
real spellthrowing ability, a strong aversion to companions, and little 
in the way of survival skills. However, he has one ability that marks 
him as different:

He can conjure monsters from midair, and these monsters will fight for 
him, with a few exceptions (see below).

#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (Mana stat)

#####GMagic Usage
[[[[[BThe summoner's powers of invocation are accessed using the 'm' key.]
In order to invoke a monster, a summoner must posses a related totem.

There are two kinds of summoning, decided by the totem used:

[[[[[BPartial Summoning]
Partial summoning creates a simulacrum of the monster, with little will 
of its own. The Summoner must maintain the simulacrum using mana; when 
he runs out, or stops paying the mana, the simulacrum vanishes.

[[[[[BTrue Summoning]
True summoning is quite different in effect from Partial Summoning, but the 
two are closely related in usage. A True Totem conjures a full copy of the 
creature in question; the process tends to make the monster a loyal ally to 
the summoner, but this loyalty is not guaranteed, nor is the survival of the 
totem used in the summoning.

[[[[[BTotem Creation]
In order to summon any creature, the Summoner needs a totem. Totems cannot be 
found, they must be created through a special process which involves taking 
the corpse of a creature (the summoner need not have been involved in the 
death of the creature in question), and extracting certain essences from it.

The summoner can create a totem using the 'm' command, and unless one is 
working on a unique's corpse, must choose whether the resulting totem is a 
Partial or True Totem.

[[[[[BImportant Note]
Uniques are very willful creatures by definition, and thus have three special 
rules about their summoning:
1. No partial totem can be made from a unique's corpse.
2. The totem in question is always destroyed.
3. The unique is twice as likely to be disloyal.

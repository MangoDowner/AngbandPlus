Hedge Magic (INT-based)
=======================

Hedge magic is the least powerful of all the types of magic. However, it is also the easiest to learn which makes it ideally suited to the part- time magician. The power of hedge magic comes from charms - natural items that contain some power. The hedge magician draws the power from these items and forms it into cantrips. Usually, many cantrips can be cast from a single item. However, occasionally the power leaks out from an item and it crumbles to useless dust. A miscast cantrip will always destroy its charm, so the wise hedge magician will always carry spares. The best way to avoid such miscasts is to have a high intelligence.

Requirements
============

Obviously, to cast a cantrip the appropriate charm must be available. The caster must also be able to see the charm and not be confused. Hedge magic can be learned from practice and individual cantrips do not need to be learned separately.

Usage
=====

You can use cantrips at any time except when in a shop, in the dark without a light source, blind or confused. Press the 'h' key to use a charm (control-W in the roguelike keyset), then select the charm and select which cantrip you wish to cast from the charm.

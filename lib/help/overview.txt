
====== The title screen ======

     When you start up the game, a title screen appears, bearing the game logo,
a dragon image, and some credits.  Also on this screen are the three most
important Sangband resources:
     The Sangband home page at "http://home.sprintmail.com/~leon2m/sang/"
contains the current source and executables, special files, helpful comments,
hints, and links, and the latest Sangband news.
     Sangband changes maintainers every so often.  The current one is Leon
Marrick.  If you want to send him comments, or make sure your bug report gets
heard, email "leon2m@sprintmail.com".
     The Angband newsgroup is at "news:rec.games.roguelike.angband"; it's filled
with helpful folks.  If you want to talk about Sangband or ask for help, this
discussion forum is the place to go.


====== The birth interface ======

     The game then shows the file-management menu if it didn't find a savefile
list.  This menu allows you to start new characters and manually load old
savefiles.  Normally you will want to do the former.  On some systems, such as
Macintosh and Windows, you can also use the menu commands.

     Creating a character is easy.  You choose a gender, a race, and roll for
vital statistics and money.
     Once you have does this, you are presented with another display showing
more information about your character.  You also see this display every time you
load an existing savefile, and whenever you press 'C'.  At this point you can
reroll for better statistics and more money, press Return when satisfied, and
name your character.


====== The main screen ======

     Once you clear the character display, you find yourself looking at the main
screen.  This display is divided into four parts:

1)   The message line is located at the top of the screen; here all sorts of
messages are shown.  If in the heat of combat you skip past one too many, you
can display it again by pressing control-P.
2)   The left side of the screen is used to display important information.
3)   Most of the screen displays your surroundings.  You can take a closer look
by pressing 'l'ook (or e'x'amine).
4)   The bottom line of the main screen shows various status displays, such as
your speed, ailments, depth, and so on.


====== The character screen  ('C') ======

     The character information display you see when first starting the game can
be recalled by typing 'C'.  Here you can review your attributes, change names,
and save character dumps to file (which appear in the "lib/user" directory).


====== The skills screen  ('$') ======

     When you collect enough experience, you can spend it on skills by typing
'$' to open up the skills advancement screen.


====== The help screen  ('?') ======

     The online help system is available by typing '?'.  You can also learn more
about the symbols you see on screen by typing '/', then the symbol you wish to
learn more about.


====== The options screen  ('=') ======

     You can adjust the way the game looks and behaves by typing '=' to enter
the options screen.


====== The knowledge screen  ('~') ======

     Detailed listings of known artifacts, objects, and monsters are available
through the knowledge menu, which you access by typing '~'.  Here you can also
review the high score listings, what you have stashed in your home, and see how
many monsters you've killed and what quests you are assigned.


====== The death interface ======

     If you should die, you will see a tombstone and be able to check out your
slain character one last time.  Here you can:
- display the character screen and see your possessions,
- review the final messages,
- save information in a character dump,
- see the high score table, and
- fully identify individual items.

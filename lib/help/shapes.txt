=== Shapeshifting ===

Some strange magicks may turn you into a different species. The two most common
ways are getting blasted by a Rune of Change -- if you are already in
a different shape, repeated blastings do nothing -- and 'q'uaffing from an
enchanted fountain. You may decide to only drink from fountains you manage to
identify with a successful Perception roll when walking next to them. If you
make your roll, look at the fountain to see what it does.

Shapeshifting lasts at least for the current dungeon level and the next dungeon
level. (Town doesn't count.) After that, every time you take the stairs down,
there's a 50% chance of returning to your original form. Note that temporary
blessings from goddesses work similarly.

Here's a list of all possible shapes. All shapes are possible when getting
blasted by a Rune of Change. The first five shapes are possible fountain
effects.


====== Game Tutorial:  The Novice's Guide ======

     When you begin the game, you are in the dungeon. You need to descend to 
level 49, where you will meet a tough boss. Killing this opponent will allow
you to descend to level 50 where you can meet and (probably be killed by) 
the Witch King of Angmar.

     Look at the left side of the screen, where all the most important info
about you is displayed.  Reading from the top, you'll see your race, 
current title, experience, and money on hand.  

     Below these are the nine vital statistics:  Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Constitution, Agility, Stealth, Perception and Luck. Near the bottom, 
you will see your armour class, hit points, and your spell points.
Armour class shields you from direct damage.  Hitpoints are your life wrapped up
in a number, so run from anything that drops them too low, too fast. 
Spell points allow you to cast magic - but they only regenerate when you go 
down stairs to a new level, so use them sparingly.

     Get familiar with some of the commands you have available to you, either by
reading the help, or by experimenting, whichever you prefer.
     To exit this tutorial, hit escape.  When ready to continue, type '?' to
open up help, then press '1', then '2'.

     Okay, time to get playing!  
     
     Go off and explore the dungeon.  When your light runs out, re'F'uel it.  
When you get hungry, 'E'at some of the food your character started out with.

     When you meet your first monster, pepper it with sling shots (press 'f' to
fire) until it reaches you, and hit it with your weapon (move into it) until
it's dead.  If your HPs drop too low, cast Cure Light Wounds (press 'm' to cast
a spell) or run away.

     When you find a '>', that's a down staircase. Head down (once on top of 
the staircase, type '>'). There are up staircases in Ironband too but they are
just for decoration - you can never go up by any means until you defeat your
ultimate opponent.

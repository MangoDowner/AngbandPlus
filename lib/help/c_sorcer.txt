#####R=== Sorcerors ===

#####GDescription
Sorcerors are to magic what unbelievers are to melee. They are the all-
around best magicians, being able to cast any spell from their seven 
magic realms without having to learn it. On the downside, they are the 
worst fighters, being unable to use any weapon but a Mage Staff 
comfortably, and still unable to be anything even remotely approaching 
effective with it. To compensate for their ability to cast all spells, 
Sorcerors gain no experience from casting new spells.

#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (spellcasting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
The Sorcerer can't fight with a weapon unless it's a Mage Staff. But 
they can use every spell of their seven magic realms. They have no need
to learn the spells - they already know them, and as soon as their 
character level permits they are capable of casting any of them. They
still, however, are required to read the spells from their spellbooks - 
so will need to be choosy about which spells and books they wish to 
take with them into the dungeon (with 6 realms, their backpack could
fill extremely quickly!!!)

Sorcerors can cast spells from the following realms:

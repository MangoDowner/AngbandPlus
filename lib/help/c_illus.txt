#####R=== Illusionists ===

#####GDescription
An illusionist is a different version of the Mage class. This class 
believes more in confusing and tricking monsters rather than outright 
damage spells. Besides this, the illusionist is the same as the *****c_mage.txt*0[mage].

#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (spellcasting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
Illusionists focus on the strange *****m_illus.txt*0[Illusion] Realm and can't use any 
other realms, but they can use ALL the illusion spells (other classes 
can only use the ones of the normal books). They may learn up to 64
spell levels in the Illusion Realm.

#####GStarting Equipment
An illusionist begins the game with:
    L1 book of illusions
    a dagger
    a scroll of word of recall
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:
    potions of see invisible

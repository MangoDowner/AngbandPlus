=== Demigod Parentage ===

***** <Minor God>
--- Minor God ---

  Fathered by a minor god, you gain no starting powers.


***** <Zeus>
--- Zeus ---

  Zeus, King of the gods and ruler of Mount Olympus, is god of the Sky and
  Thunder, and nominal husband of Hera.  You inherit increased stature and your
  divine birth will be marked by your aura of electricity. You also resist
  lightning.


***** <Poseidon>
--- Poseidon ---

  Poseidon, Brother of Zeus, is Lord of the Seas and Storm.  You inherit
  elemental protection and corrosive attacks that melt the armor of your foes.


***** <Hades>
--- Hades ---

  Hades is Ruler of the Underworld.  You gain resistance to nether forces,
  increased fortitude and have a firm grasp on your life and health.


***** <Athena>
--- Athena ---

  Athena is the great goddess of wisdom and the protector of Athens. She was
  born of Zeus and the Titan Metis, and her cunning far surpasses that of the
  other deities.  You inherit great clarity of thought and magic and will be
  able to cast spells more reliably than other mortals. And should you fail to
  cast a spell, you will pay a reduced casting cost rather than the full
  amount. You have a firm grip on your mental prowess.


***** <Ares>
--- Ares ---

  Ares is the bold son of Zeus and Hera, whose very name is feared and
  respected by warriors and citizens alike. His legendary combat prowess
  exceeds that of Zeus and Poseidon, but he is less skilled in wiles than the
  other Olympians.  You inherit exceptional bonuses to combat and have a firm
  grip on your strength. Later in life, you will be able to fly into a berserk
  rage on command. However, your lust for combat decreases your stealth as you
  call out challenges to all that you meet. And your resistance to magic is
  suspect.


***** <Hermes>
--- Hermes ---

  Hermes, the Messenger, is the extremely cunning diplomat used by the
  Olympians to negotiate truces. With his Winged Sandals and his powerful
  magic, there is no place barred from him, and there is no way to detain him. 
  You inherit great powers of motion and will never become slowed. Your stealth
  is better than your brethren and your speed will increase with experience.


***** <Apollo>
--- Apollo ---

  Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun, truth and
  prophecy, medicine, healing, plague, music, poetry, arts, archery, and more. 
  You inherit powers of illumination and are completely immune to light based
  attacks. You are seldom blinded.


***** <Artemis>
--- Artemis ---

  Artemis was often described as the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin
  sister of Apollo. She was the Hellenic goddess of the hunt, wild animals,
  wilderness, childbirth, virginity and young girls, bringing and relieving
  disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and
  arrows.  You inherit powers of archery and are very nimble. Your skills with
  the bow are unmatched and you shoot arrows with increased range and
  deadliness.


***** <Hephaestus>
--- Hephaestus ---

  Hephaestus was the god of technology, blacksmiths, craftsmen, artisans,
  sculptors, metals, metallurgy, fire and volcanoes. Like other mythic smiths
  but unlike most other gods, Hephaestus was lame, which gave him a grotesque
  appearance in Greek eyes. He served as the blacksmith of the gods.  You
  inherit powers of enchantment and protection. Your equipment will not suffer
  diminution by corrosion or magical attack.


***** <Hera>
--- Hera ---

  Hera was the wife and one of three sisters of Zeus.  Her chief function was
  as the goddess of women and marriage.  You inherit great clarity of mind and
  capacity for magic. You are very wise and have a firm grasp on your magical
  energy, which is even augmented.


***** <Demeter>
--- Demeter ---

  Demeter is the goddess of the harvest, who presided over grains, the
  fertility of the earth, and the seasons.  You gain powers of regeneration,
  healing, and temperance. Eventually, you will become resistant to the ravages
  of time.


***** <Aphrodite>
--- Aphrodite ---

  Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. 
  You inherit her sex appeal. As such, your pets are more obedient and
  shopkeepers fawn over you in their efforts to please you. You may kiss
  monsters and they might even decide to follow you with slavish devotion,
  though sometimes this just angers them.

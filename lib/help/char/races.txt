RACES - descriptions, intrinsic abilities, stats

There are thirty different races that you can choose from in
ZAngband.  Some races are restricted as to what profession
they may be.  Each race has various strengths and weaknesses
and its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities.
Many races also have intrinsic abilities and powers. 

Each of the races has certain modifications to their starting
statistics and abilities and an experience penalty. The
experience penalty is designed to 'balance' the races with
better starting statistics and abilities by requiring them to
earn more experience before advancing a level. 
 
========================================================================
=== Human ===

The human is the base character.  All other races are com-
pared to them.  Humans can choose any class and are average
at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any
other race because of their shorter life spans.  No racial
adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.
 
Racial Power: None. 

========================================================================
=== Half-Elf ===

Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  but
not as strong.  Half-elves are slightly better at searching,
disarming, saving throws, stealth, bows, and magic, but they
are not as good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any
class and do not receive any intrinsic abilities.
 
Racial Power: None. 

========================================================================
=== Elf ===

Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
fighting.  They tend to be smarter and faster than either
humans or half-elves and also have better wisdom.  Elves
are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows,
and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.  Elves
may choose any class except Paladin.  They resist light
effects intrinsically.

Racial Power: None. 
 
========================================================================
=== Hobbit ===

Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
have good saving throws.  They also are very good at search-
ing, disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excel-
lent rogues, but prefer to be called burglars.  They will be
much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting.
Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect warm
creatures at a distance.  Hobbits can choose between being a
warrior, mage, or rogue.  They have their dexterity sustained.
They are very fond of food, and learn, in due time, to cook
a delicious meal from available ingredients.

========================================================================
=== Gnome ===

Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings.
They, like  the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like
homes.  Gnomes make excellent mages, and have very good saving
throws.  They are good at searching, disarming, perception,
and stealth.  They have lower strength than humans so they
are not very good at fighting with hand weapons.  Gnomes have
fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures
at a distance.  A gnome may choose between being a warrior,
mage, priest, or rogue.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected
against paralysis and some slowing effects.  At higher levels,
Gnomes learn to teleport at will.

========================================================================
=== Dwarf ===

Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
excellent choices for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves tend to
be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
humans.  Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise,
they resist spells which are cast on them.  Dwarves also have
very good infra-vision because they live underground.  They
do have one big drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no
good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In
other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.  They can never
be blinded.  Dwarves also learn to study the structure of a
dungeon, and can spot things that go unseen by the other races.

========================================================================
=== Half-Orc ===

Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but
are terrible at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.
Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for
goods in town.  Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues,
for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great
constitutions and lots of hit points.  Because of their
preference to living underground to on the surface, half-orcs
resist darkness attacks.  Upon reaching experience level 3, a
half-orc learns to dispel any fear that may be upon him or her.

  Level Cost Stat   Difficulty   Effect
    3     5   Wis  10, 5 if War  Remove fear.
 
========================================================================
=== Half-Troll ==

Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points
than any other character race.  They are also very stupid and
slow.  They will make great warriors and iffy priests.  They
are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.
They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.
They also happen to be fun to run...  Half-trolls always have
their strength sustained.  At higher levels, Half-Trolls learn
to enter a berserk fury, and regenerate wounds automatically.
Additionally, at level 15, Half-Troll warriors gain slow-digestion.

========================================================================
=== Amberite ===

The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed
with numerous advantages, not only their longevity.  They are
very tough and endurant; their constitution cannot be reduced,
and their ability to heal wounds far surpasses that of any
other race.  Having seen virtually everything, very little
is new to them, and they gain levels much slower than the
other races.  But should they advance high enough, they will
learn the innate Amberite powers of Pattern Mindwalking and
Shadow Shifting.

They are good at perception, fighting and with bows and are
reasonably skilled in all other areas.  They are very tough and
endurant and their constitution cannot be reduced.  They also
regenerate, alowing them to recover from wounds quickly.

                             and hallucination.
 
========================================================================
=== High-Elf ===

High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the
beginning of time. They are masters of all skills, and are
strong and intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes
suspect.  They can play all classes except Paladin, and very
well at that.  High-elves begin their lives able to see the
unseen, and resist light effects just like regular elves.
However, there are few things that they have not seen
already, and experience is very hard for them to gain.

Racial Power: None

 
========================================================================
=== Barbarian ===

Barbarians are hardy men of the north. They are fierce in
combat, and their wrath is feared throughout the world.
Combat is their life: they feel no fear, and they learn
to enter battle frenzy at will even sooner than half-trolls.
Barbarians are, however, suspicious of magic, which makes
magic devices fairly hard for them to use, and also makes
it impossible for them to play Mages. They cannot play
Paladins, either, because their wild bloodlust is totally
incompatible with the strict discipline of knighthood.

Racial Power:

                                 10+1dlevel turns, heal 30.

========================================================================
=== Half-Ogre ===

Half-Ogres are like Half-Orcs, but only more so. They
are big, bad, and stupid. For warriors, they have all
the necessary attributes, and they can even become
wizards: after all, they are related to Ogre Magi,
from whom they have learned the skill of setting
trapped runes once their level is high enough. Like Half-
Orcs, they resist darkness, and like Half-Trolls, they
have their strength sustained.

Racial Power:

                             the Sorcery spell)
 
========================================================================
=== Half-Giant ===

Half-Giants are not too unusual, as there has been a
tradition according to which it is a noble and brave thing
to do to consort a giant (especially a giant-maid). Never-
theless, the poor offspring of such a union is seldom very
popular in the world of men. Their limited intelligence
makes it impossible for them to become full spellcasters,
but with their huge strength they make excellent warriors.
They also love to wander in the wilderness, and can become
rangers. No ordinary wall can withstand the fury of a giant,
or a half-giant, and at higher levels they can learn the
power of magical digging. Their thick skin makes them
resistant to shards, and like Half-Ogres and Half-Trolls,
they have their strength sustained.

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    20   10   Str     12     Stone to mud.
 
========================================================================
=== Half-Titan ===

Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these
immensely powerful creatures put almost any other race
to shame. They may lack the fascinating special powers
of certain other races, but their enhanced attributes
more than make up for that. They learn to estimate the
strengths of their foes, and their love for law and
order makes them resistant to the effects of Chaos.

Half-Titans have reasonable skills but their large size
makes disarming traps and moving stealthily a challenge.

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    35   20   Int     12     Probing.
 
========================================================================
=== Cyclops ===

With but one eye, a cyclops can see more than many
with two eyes. They are headstrong, and loud noises
bother them very little. They are not quite qualified
for the magic using professions, but as a certain Mr
Ulysses can testify, their accuracy with thrown rocks
can be deadly...

A cyclops is very strong but not very intelligent.
Not to mention that they make a Half-Troll look handsome by comparison. A cycops is good at fighting and with bows but
poor at most other skills. Cyclops resist sonic attacks. 

Racial Power:

                             does (3*level)/2 damage.
 
========================================================================
=== Yeek ===

Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures and even a mediocre
monster can wipe the proverbial floor with an unwary specimen.
Fortunately, their horrible screams can scare away less confident
foes.

Although not strong physically, they are fairly intellegent and
somewhat wise. Yeeks have poor fighting skills but are good at
all other areas. Overtime their skins become increasingly resistant
to the effects of acid until they eventually become immune to its
effects at level 20. 

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    15   15   Wis     10     Tries to scare one monster.
 
========================================================================
=== Klackon ===

Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid
creatures. They make great servants and warriors, but
their mental abilities are severely limited. Obedient
and well-ordered, they can never be confused. They are
also very nimble, and become faster as they advance
levels, gaining a point of speed for every 10 levels gained.
They are also very acidic, inherently resisting
acid, and capable of spitting acid at higher levels.

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    9     9   Dex     14     Below level 25, this fires an acid
                             bolt, otherwise a radius-2 acid
                             ball. Damage equal to player level.
 
========================================================================
=== Kobold ===

Kobolds are a weak goblin race. They love poisoned weapons,
and can learn to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry
an unlimited supply). They are also inherently resistant to
poison, and can become adequate fighters, although they are
not one of the more powerful races.  Kobolds make reasonable
fighters but are poor at most other skills. 

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    12    8   Dex     14     Poison bolt, damage same as level. 
 
========================================================================
=== Nibelung ===

The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these
cave-dwellers are not much bothered by darkness. Their
natural inclination to magical items has made them immune
to effects which could drain away magical bonuses on
equipment.  Like ordinary dwarves, they can examine the
dungeon to discover traps and secret doors.  They are
reasonable at most skills. 

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    10    5   Wis     10     Detect traps, doors, and stairs.
 
========================================================================
=== Dark Elf ===

Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by
darkness attacks, the Dark Elves have a long tradition
and knowledge of magic. With their intelligence they can
become superb mages or priests, and they have an inherent
magic missile attack available to them at a low level. 

Dark-Elves are good at magic devices and are both intelligent
and wise making spellcasting easier than for many other races.
With their keen sight, they also learn to see invisible things
as their relatives High-Elves do, but at a level 20. Dark-elves
are also resistant to darkness attacks. 

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect

========================================================================
=== Draconian ===

A humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. As they advance
levels, they gain new elemental resistances (up to Poison
Resistance at level 35), and they also have a breath weapon,
which becomes more powerful with experience. The exact type of
the breath weapon depends on the draconian's class and
level. With their wings, they can easily levitate over any
pit trap and over lava and water unharmed.  Draconians have
excellent starting statistics and are good at most skills. 

Racial Power:
  Level Cost  Stat Difficulty Effect
    1   level  Con     12     Breath attack - see below.

Draconian breath attack: 

  There is a (level)% chance that the breath is a class-dependent
  special breath.  Otherwise, you get a fire breath (2/3 of the
  time) or a cold breath (1/3 of the time). All breaths are ball
  spells with a radius of 1+level/15, and damage 2*level. 

  The class dependent special attacks:

  (For each of these, the first has a 2/3 chance, the second 1/3). 

    Warrior, Ranger: Shards, or "the elements" (pure damage). 

    Mage, Warrior Mage, High Mage: Disenchantment, or Mana (pure damage). 

    Chaos Warrior: Confusion, or Chaos. 

    Monk: Confusion, or Sound. 

    Mindcrafter: Confusion, or "mental energy" - Not only do mindless
      creatures resist, but psi damage can backlash if used against high
      demons and undead! Don't breathe this in a graveyard... 

    Priest, Paladin: Holy Fire (dam*2 vs evil, good are immune, others
      resist), or Hellfire (dam*2 vs evil). 

    Rogue: Poison, or Darkness. 

 
========================================================================
=== Mind Flayer ===

A secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their civilization
may well be older than any other on our planet, and their
intelligence and wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so
great that they enable Mind Flayers to become more powerful
spellcasters than any other race, even if their physical
attributes are a good deal less admirable. As they advance
levels, they gain the powers of See Invisible, Telepathy
and a mind blast attack.

Mindflayers have their Intelligence and Wisdom sustained and
gain the powers of seeing the invisible at level 15 and
telepathy at level 30. 

Racial Power:  Mind blast attack (to verify details)  

 
========================================================================
=== Imp ===

A demon-creature from the nether-world, naturally resistant
to fire attacks, and capable of learning fire bolt and fire
ball attacks. They are little loved by other races, but
can perform fairly well in most professions.

They gain the power to see invisible creatures at level 10. 

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    9    15   Wis     15     Below level 30, this fires a fire bolt,
                             otherwise a radius-2 fire ball. Damage
                             equal to player level. 
 
========================================================================
=== Golem ===

A golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless
raw material like clay, and awakened to life. They are
nearly mindless, making them useless for professions which
rely on magic, but as warriors they are very tough. They
are resistant to poison, they can see invisible things,
and have free action.  At level 35, they also become
resistant to life draining attacks. 

Golems gain very little nutrition from ordinary food but
have their digestion slowed.  They need to collect scrolls
of satisfy hunger, or perish of exhaustion when the life
force animating their body runs out.

They also learn to temporarily turn their skin into a very
hard, stonelike substance.  They gain natural armor class
bonus from their tough body at the rate of 20 + level/5 points. 

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    20   15   Con     8      Stone skin - increase AC for
                             30+random(20) turns.  
 
========================================================================
=== Skeleton ===

There are two types of skeletons: the ordinary, warrior-
like skeletons, and the spell-using skeletons, which are
also called liches. As undead beings, skeletons need to
worry very little about poison or attacks that can drain
life. They do not really use eyes for perceiving things,
and are thus not fooled by invisibility. Their bones are
resistant to sharp shrapnels (not much to cut there), and
they will quickly become resistant to cold at level 10.

Should a skeleton be unlucky enough to lose some of his or
her remaining life, he or she will learn to restore it at
will. It is very hard for skeletons to eat food or drink
potions. Although the magical effects of these will affect
the skeleton even without entering the skeleton's (non-
existent) belly, the potion / food itself will fall through
the skeleton's jaws, giving no nutritional benefit.

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    30   30   Wis     18     Restore drained experience.
 
========================================================================
=== Zombie ===

Much like Skeletons, Zombies too are undead horrors: they
are resistant to life-draining attacks, and can learn to
restore their life-force. Like skeletons, they become
resistant to cold-based attacks (level 5, earlier than
skeletons), resist poison and can see invisible. While
still vulnerable to cuts (unlike skeletons), Zombies are
resistant to Nether. Like golems, they gain very little
nutrition from the food of mortals. However, Zombies are,
as the name implies, practically mindless: in this company,
Groo would seem a genius.

Racial Power:
  Level Cost Stat Difficulty Effect
    30   30   Wis     18     Restore drained experience.
 
========================================================================
=== Vampire ===

One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an
awe-inspiring sight. As undead, the Vampire has a firm hold on
its life force, and resists nether attacks. The Vampire also resists
cold and poison based attacks. It is, however, susceptible to its
perpetual hunger for fresh blood, which can only be satiated by
sucking the blood from a nearby monster (see the Vampire's
racial power). 

This mighty creature has a serious weakness: the bright rays of
the sun (and certain light sources) are its bane, and it will need to
flee the surface to the deep recesses of earth until the sun finally
sets. Darkness, on the other hand, only makes the Vampire
stronger. Fortunately, vampires radiate an aura of 'dark light' of
their own. Light resistance will, in any case, protect the vampire
from the adverse effects of sunlight. 

Racial Power:
  Level   Cost    Stat Difficulty Effect
    2   1+level/3  Con     9      Steal life - damage
                                  lev+random(lev)*max(1,lev/10), and
                                  heal the same amount, unless the
                                  player is Full (or Gorged). You gain
                                  150 nutrition points per hp drained (a
                                  food ration is 5000). You do gain
                                  nutrition when Full, but you cannot
                                  become Gorged using this.
 
========================================================================
=== Spectre ===

Another powerful undead creature: the spectre is a ghastly
apparition, surrounded by an unearthly green glow. They exist
only partially on our plane of existence: half-corporeal,
they can pass through walls, although the density of the
wall will hurt them in the process of doing this. The spectre
can scream an eldritch howl, which is enough to scare lesser
monsters witless. As undead, they have a firm hold on their
life force, see invisible, and resist poison and cold. They
also resist nether; in fact, their half-corporeal form
actually grows stronger from the effects of nether. At
level 35 they develop telepathic abilities. Spectres
make superb spellcasters, but their physical form is very
weak. Like Golems and Zombies, Spectres gain almost no
nutrition from ordinary food but have their digestion slowed. 

Racial Power:

=== Sprite ===

One of the several fairy races, sprites are very small.
They have tiny wings, and can fly over traps that may open
up beneath them. They enjoy sunlight intensely, and resist
light based attacks. Although physically among the weakest
races, Sprites are very talented in magic, and can become
highly skilled wizards. Sprites have the special power of
spraying Sleeping Dust, and at higher levels they learn to
fly faster at the rate of one point for every 10 levels
gained. 

Racial Power:

                             in line of sight. 
 
========================================================================
=== Beastman ===

This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos.
It is not an independent race but rather a humanoid creature,
most often a human, twisted by the Chaos, or a nightmarsh
crossbreed of a human and a beast. All Beastmen are accustomed
to Chaos so much that they are untroubled by confusion and
sound attacks, although raw Logrus can still have effects on
them. Beastmen revel in chaos, as it twists them more and
more. Beastmen are subject to mutations: when they have been
created, they receive a random mutation. After that,
every time they advance a level they have a little chance
of gaining yet another mutation.

Racial Power: None

TABLES

=== Combinations of Race and Class ===

These are the classes that are recommended for different races. You can
still select a race that is not in the chart, but these combinations are
either rather poor (like a zombie mage) or as a concept so silly that they
are not recommended. If you pick a combination that is not on the chart,
don't complain if things don't turn out as you expected them to.

======================================================================
RACIAL POWER SUMMARY

This spoiler was made by Remco Gerlich for Zangband 2.1.0e, and may be
inaccurate for other versions.

First, something about the difficulty of racial powers.

Difficulties are shown in the game in a rather cryptic fashion, like
WIS 12@5. This means that the stat used for determining success
is Wisdom, the minimum experience level you need is 5, and the difficulty
of the power is 12.

If you are stunned, the stun counter is added to the difficulty.
Next, take (experience level - minimum level)/3. If this is less than 10,
substract it from the difficulty, otherwise substract 10.
If the difficulty is below 5, set it to 5.

Finally, the power is successful if
random(stat) >= difficulty/2 + random(difficulty/2),
where random(x) is a random number ranging from 0 to x-1, and stat is
the relevant stat (with percentiles added, so 18/100 is 118). "Difficulty/2"
is rounded down (so if the difficulty is 5, the minimum, difficulty/2 is 2,
and the whole right hand side is 2 or 3).

What does this mean for failure rates? Suppose d = difficulty/2, rounded
down, _and the stat is higher than the difficulty_.
Then failure rate = (1.5*d)/stat, approximately.

This is slightly inaccurate if d is odd. Also, if the stat is lower than
the difficulty, this formula doesn't hold, and failure rates go up fast.

The racial powers:

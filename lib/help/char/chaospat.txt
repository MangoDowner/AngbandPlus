Chaos Patrons
=============

This spoiler was made by Remco Gerlich for Zangband 2.1.1c. It may
be inaccurate for other versions.

Chaos Warriors have a chaos patron, who will give them a present, or
do something nasty to them each time they advance their level. Note that
if you gain multiple levels at the same time, you will only get a reward
for the first one.
There are 36 different things they can do, and 16 Chaos Patrons.
Each Patron can give only some of those rewards.

The questions to answer:
o   Which Chaos Patrons are there?
o   What can they do?

The procedure of selecting a reward is in "What can they do?".

The rewards get short names. With the Patrons are listed the powers
that they have. Then look them up in the "What can they do?" list.
Each Patron (except Balo) also has a "favourite stat", that is also
listed below.

What can they do?
=================

There is a 1 in 6 chance that you will get a random mutation. If you don't,
you get one of the reward types.

Each patron can give 20 rewards - not all of them different, if a
reward is in his list multiple times, that just increases the chance
of getting that. The first five in the list are considered "nasty",
the rest isn't. Usually, a random reward is chosen from the "nice" 15.
But you may be unlucky.

Usually, you have a 1 in 6 chance of being unlucky. If you become lvl
13, however, the chance is 1 in 2. If your level is merely a multiple
of 13, it is 1 in 3. If, on the other hand, your level is 14 or a multiple
of 14, the chance is only 1 in 12. If you're unlucky, a reward is chosen
randomly from the full list.

Listed with the "short name", the powers are:

"polymorph"     "Thou needs a new form, mortal!"
                Invokes the Polymorph Self spell.

"gain exp"      "Well done, mortal! Lead on!"
                Gain +50% xp, with a maximum of 100,000 points.

"lose exp"      "Thou didst not deserve that, slave."
                Loose 1/6th of your exp.

"good obj"      "Use my gift wisely."
                Create one good object on the floor.

"great obj"     "Use my gift wisely."
                Create one great object on the floor.

"chaos weap"    "Thy deed hath earned thee a worthy blade."
                Create a chaos weapon... +to hit and +to dam both
                3+random(10) after dungeon level 9, 3+1d(dun lvl)
                before that. (Chaotic) weapon. 1 random high resist.
                Always a sharp (edged) weapon, btw.

"good obs"      "Thy deed hath earned thee a worthy reward."
                Create 1-3 good objects.

"great obs"     "Behold, mortal, how generously I reward thy loyalty."
                Create 1-3 great objects.

"ty curse"      "Thou art growing arrogant, mortal."
                Invoke The Curse of Topi Ylinen...

"summon"        "My pets, destroy the arrogant mortal!"
                Summon 2-6 monsters (not a flat random, weird formula).

"hi summon"     "Thou needst worthier opponents!"
                Can summon Ants, Spiders, Hounds, Hydrae, Angels, Undead,
                Demons, Wraiths, Uniques, High Undead, High Dragons, or
                Cyberdemons. The deeper you are, the higher the chance of
                the ones later in the list. It's quite possible (quite
                usual, in fact) that it'll do several of these summons.

"havoc"         "Death and destruction! This pleases me!"
                Call Chaos - random damage. Random damage type.
                1 in 6 times, do 75 damage. 3 in 4 changing of doing
                a player-centered ball, otherwise a beam (that you can't
                aim, it seems, so it doesn't work - didn't test this).
                Otherwise, a 1 in 3 chance of doing a dam 300 radius 8 (!)
                ball. Otherwise, do 150 damage, you get asked for a direction,
                and it does a beam 1/4 of the time, a ball otherwise.

"gain abil"     "Stay, mortal, and let me mold thee."
                Gain a random stat; or, 1 in 3 times, the favourite stat
                of the Patron.

"lose abil"     "I grow tired of thee, mortal."
                Lose a stat in the same way.

"ruin abil"     "Thou needst a lesson in humility, mortal!"
                Decrease all stats.

"augm abil"     "Receive this modest gift from me!"
                Augmentation - increase all stats.

"poly wound"    "You feel the power of 'patron' touch you."
                Polymorph wounds. 1 in 5 chance of a nasty effect.
                In that case, take (level)d5 damage, and add the
                same to the 'cut' counter. Otherwise, heal the same
                amount.

"heal full"     "Rise, my servant!"
                Heal 5000 hp, restore life levels, restore stats,
                cure poison, blindness, confusion, hallucination,
                stunning and cuts.

"hurt lot"      "Suffer, pathetic fool!"
                Does a nice damage lvl*4, radius 4 disintegration ball
                centered on the player. Unfortunately, also hits you
                for lvl*4 hitpoints.

"curse weap"    "Thou reliest too much on the weapon."
                Curse your weapon - makes it a very bad weapon.
                Artifacts have a 50% saving throw.

"curse arm"     "Thou reliest too much on thine equipment."
                Curses your body armour in the same way.

"piss off"      "Now thou shalt pay for annoying me."
                Randomly one of the following other rewards: "ty curse",
                "hi summon", "ruin abil", or curse. Curse does "curse weap"
                or "curse arm", randomly.

"wrath"         "Die, mortal!"
                Take 4*level damage, "ty curse", decrease all stats,
                "hi summon", "curse weap" 50% of the time, and "curse arm"
                50% of the time.

"destruct"      "Death and destruction! This pleaseth me!"
                *Destructs* the area around the player.

"genocide"      "Let me relieve thee of thine oppressors!"
                Gives you the chance to genocide a monster type. You
                don't take the normal "genocide strain" damage.

"mass geno"     "Let me relieve thee of thine oppressors!"
                Mass genocides everything in the neighbourhood. Do not
                take damage.

"dispel"        "You can feel the power of 'patron' assault your enemies!"
                Hit all monsters in sight with 4*level damage.

"ignore"        "'Patron' ignores you."
                Do nothing.

"pet undead"    "'Patron' rewards you with an undead servant!"
                Gives you a pet undead.

"pet demon"     "'Patron' rewards you with a demonic servant!"
                Gives you a pet demon.

"pet monst"     "'Patron' rewards you with a servant!"
                Gives you a pet monster.

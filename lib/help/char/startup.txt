STARTUP DECISIONS  (Maximize, Preserver, AutoRoll, Life Rating)

=============================================================================

MAXIMIZE MODE

      At initial character generation, maximize mode makes no difference
      for statistics under 18. For scores above 18, each die spot turns into
      5 to 20 percentage points when not in maximize mode; in maximize
      mode, each spot turns into exactly 10 percentage points. Therefore,
      you can achieve higher stats when not in maximize mode. However,
      in maximize mode the racial and class stat bonuses/penalties are
      applied to your statistical maximums; this enables you to eventually
      attain a higher natural set of statistics. In the long run, the game is
      easier in maximize mode, but it's much tougher in the beginning.
      Characters created in maximize mode get their statistic corrections
      applied after the roll. The maximum then is not 18/100 for all stats
      but 18/(100 +/- 10*correction).

  Additional info on (NON-)MAXIMIZE MODE
  --------------------------------------

    All characters receive stat modifiers based on their race and class
    (Half-Trolls get an INT penalty, Priests get a WIS bonus, and so forth).
    The maximize mode flag determines how these modifiers are applied to
    the character's actual stats. Since this obviously affects character
    creation, the value of this flag must be chosen before you create your
    character. 

    As an example of how this works, imagine rolling up a High-Elf Mage.
    High-Elf Mages receive a combined racial and class bonus of +6 to INT;
    for purposes of illustration, let's say the stat roller rolls a 17 INT (the
    highest possible value before modification). 

    In non-maximize mode, the +6 bonus is applied much as if the character
    quaffed six Potions of Intelligence. The positive side of this is that your
    character can get a starting INT of around 18/70, since each "potion" can
    give them more than 10 percentiles once they are past 18. The negative
    side of this is that this 18/70 is now your character's base INT, and
    without stat-boosting items, he/she can only push their base INT up to
    18/100. 

    In maximize mode, the +6 bonus is applied as though the character had
    swallowed a Ring of Intelligence (+6). The negative side of this is that
    your character can't get a starting INT above 18/50 (17 plus the +6
    "ring" bonus). The positive side of this is that although the effective INT
    is 18/50, the base INT is only 17; once you've pushed your character's
    base INT up to 18/100, the effective INT without stat-boosting items will
    be 18/160! 

    On the flip side, our High-Elf Mage also gets a combined -4 penalty to
    STR. In non-maximize mode, this is treated like quaffing four Potions of
    Weakness, but your character's STR can still be increased all the way up
    to 18/100. In maximize mode, you've effectively got a Spleen of
    Weakness (-4), which means that your character's maximum possible
    effective STR, without stat-boosting items, is 18/60 (18/100 base plus
    the -4 penalty). 

    In summary, then in non-maximize mode, your character will get bettter
    starting stats, and all stats will max out at 18/100. This typically makes
    the early game easier, while in maximize mode, your character's starting
    stats aren't as good, but the primary stat(s) will max out above 18/100,
    while the "off" stats will max out below 18/100. This typically makes the
    end game easier. 

=============================================================================

PRESERVE MODE

      Characters created in preserve mode receive no special level feelings,
      but any artifacts, if missed, may appear again later in the game and
      are not lost forever. Anything that would have caused a special
      feeling contributes to the general level feeling that your character
      receives instead. 

      Non-preserve mode is the opposite of preserve mode. Levels generated
      with an artifact on the dungeon floor will receive a "special" feeling.
      However, unidentified artifacts, if missed, will be lost forever. 

=============================================================================

AUTO-ROLLER

      Once you have chosen your race / class / magic combination, and
      whether or not you wish to use maximize and preserve modes, you
      will be asked whether or not you wish to use the auto-roller. 

      The auto-roller is a quick means of generating start-up characters
      based on a set of user-selected criteria. If you choose to use the
      auto-roller, you will be presented with a column giving the maximum
      possible stats for the race/class and choice of maximize mode. You
      will then be prompted to enter the desired stats which should not
      exceed the maximum stats displayed on the screen. 

      Once you have entered your desired statistics, the computer will
      randomly create successive start-up characters and compare them to
      your desired statistics until it rolls a character that matches or
      exceeds your expectations. The computer will then display the
      character for you to look at and also display the character's
      life-rating. If you accept the rolled character, you will be asked
      for its name and then brought to the town screen. If not, the
      computer will resume rolling and searching for the next match. 

      HINT: The stats are not independant of each other and trying to
      maximize each one using the auto-roller will not work. A good idea
      is to specify stats close to maximum that are critical for your
      class (for example, high wisdom for priests, intelligence for
      mages and strength and dexterity for fighters). You should set
      minimum acceptable levels for the remaining stats rather than
      looking for high rolls. 

      If you select not to use the auto-roller, the computer will roll
      one random character at a time and then display it for you to
      either accept or reject. 

  -----------------------
  More auto-roller notes:
  -----------------------

  If you use the autoroller, then remember that 18/01 is entered as 19, 18/50
  as 68 (i.e. 18+50) and so on. Generally, you can put two stats close to 
  their maximum on the autoroller with little trouble. Three is much more
  difficult (essentially the other three stats have to be close to their 
  minimum), so you can wait days. If you want to set minimums on three stats,
  you should make at least two of them several points below their maximum
  (above 18 you should drop by about 20 - or perhaps just a bit less - to
  count as a point). If it takes more than a couple of minutes, hit ^C and
  try again with lower values.

  Also, when considering Autorolling, recognize the fact that there are only
  certain 'ranges' that make a difference.  A starting Intelligence of
  18/89 is the same as a starting Intelligence of 18/70 in terms of mana.
  Of course, since 18/90 is the next 'step up', you could go for 18/80 and
  then try to buy a ring of intelligence (+1).  But a starting constitution 
  of 9 isn't much different from of 14.  So don't waste your autoroller's 
  time trying to reach a maximum for a stat that won't make a difference.  
  This of course depends on your version of Angband.  Check the spoiler sheets 
  for your version.

  The lower stat will make it take longer to max out your stats, but it really
  shouldn't make any difference in the long run.

LIFE RATING

      During the course of 'rolling' your character you will be told
      its life rating. This will be displayed in the form of x/100.
      Typically, 'x' is a number varying between 80 and 130. This is
      an indication of how many hitpoints your character will have at
      level 50 before taking into consideration any bonii from having
      a high constitution. 

      For example, a human mage has a 10-sided hitdice. (Humans have
      a 10-sided hit dice and mages receive no class hit-point bonus.)
      This gives an average of 5.5 hitpoints per level or 275 at level
      50. A life rating of 120/100 would yield: 

                (120/100)*275=330 hitpoints at level 50.

      A human mage however has a 19-sided hitdice (warriors receive a
      9 point bonus). This gives an average of 10 hitpoints per level
      or 500 at level 50. A life rating of 120/100 would therefore yield: 

                (120/100)*500=600 hitpoints at level 50.

      Your life rating as only a guarantee of hitpoints at level 50.
      This might be achieved by small increases in the early stages
      and much larger increases in the later game or the other way
      around. Generally, however, the increases tend to be fairly even.

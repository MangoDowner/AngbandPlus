CLASSES
 
Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. Some
race/class combinations are not recommended and so certain
classes will appear inside brackets. This may be either because the
combination is not conceptually sound or because the chosen race
has stat penalties in areas where the class needs bonuses. 

However, any race/class combination can be chosen and
experienced players may often choose unusual combinations for
the challenge that they represent. It is recommended that
inexperienced players choose warriors as spellcasting requires a
player more familiar with dungeon survival techniques. 

Each of the classes has certain modifications to their starting
statistics and abilities and an experience penalty. The experience
penalty is designed to 'balance' the classes with better starting
statistics and abilities and the 'dual-class' classes by requiring
them to earn more experience before advancing a level. 


==================================================================
=== Warrior ===

A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his
problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall
back on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many such
high-level devices may be forever beyond their use. 

A warrior's prime statistics are Strength, Dexterity and
Constitution. A Warrior will be good at Fighting and
Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills. Warriors cannot
learn magic and gain experience for destroying high level
spellbooks. 

As a warrior's experience increases, he will become more
profficient with his weapons and more confident in his ability to
defeat his opponents. Warriors gain resistance to fear attacks at
level 30, gain additional blows with their melee weapon at levels
15, 30 and 45 and additional shots with their missile weapon at
levels 25 and 50. Warriors also receive a level/5 plus to their
to-hit and to-dam statistics. 
 

==================================================================
=== Mage ===

A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot
hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior.
In addition to his spellbooks, a mage should carry a range of
magical devices to help him in his endeavors which he can master
far more easily than anyone else. A mage is also better able to
resist the effects of spells cast at him by his enemies. 

A mage's prime prime statistic is intelligence as this determines
his spell casting ability. Good wisdom and dexterity also help.
There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter,
but spells are the mage's true strength. With two notable
exceptions, mages should avoid wearing armor on their hands as
this can restrict their spell casting ability. 

Unlike other spellcasting classes, mages can freely choose any
two magic realms, although they will never be as good at Life
magic as a priest. Otherwise, mages tend to learn and cast all the
spells in their realms better than any other character except the
high mage who has concentrated his efforts so as to excel in a
single realm. 

 
==================================================================
=== Priest ===

A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They
explore the dungeon in the service of their God and if treasure just
happens to fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory
of their church!

A Priest's primary stat is Wisdom since this determine his success
at praying to his deity. Since Priests receive new prayers as gifts
from their patron deity, they cannot choose which ones they will
learn. Priests are familiar with magical devices which they believe
act as focii for divine intervention in the natural order of things,
but are not as good as a mage in their use. 

Priests are good at resisting spells cast at them and make decent
fighters but prefer blunt weapons over edged ones. A priest
wielding an edged weapon will be so uncumfortable with it that his
fighting ability will be affected unless it has first been blessed by
the Gods. High level priests will learn to invoke the power of their
patron deity to bless such weapons. 

There are two types of priests in Zangband: the ordinary priests
who, select Life magic as their primary realm, and the 'dark'
priests, who select Death magic instead. Since the natural
inclination of priests is towards Life Magic, priests who select
Life magic will be able to learn their prayers faster and better
than their evil colleagues. Priests can also select a secondary
realm from the other five realms, and should be able to learn
all spells in it although not as efficiently as mages.


==================================================================
=== Rogue ===

A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is
capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. Rogues are good at
locating hidden traps and doors and are the masters of disrming
traps and picking locks. A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to
sneak around many creatures without having to fight, or to get in
a telling first blow. A rogue may also backstab a fleeing monster. 

A rogue is better than a warrior or paladin with magical devices,
but still cannot rely on their performance. Rogues can also learn a
few spells from a choice of four realms, but not the powerful
offensive spells magi can use. A rogue's primary stats are
Intelligence and Dexterity but Strength and Constitution are
important too. 

There are several subtypes of Rogues in Zangband and the exact
'type' is determined by the realm of magic chosen. The common
Thief, will probably be content with Arcane magic and its wide
applicability. The Burglar, on the other hand, is more intersted in
the Sorcery spells, which allow him or her to do the job fast and
efficiently. The Assassins' partiality for Death magic is well
known, and they are feared for it. Finally, there is the Card Shark,
who will opt for Trump magic, and shuffles the decks with
amazing proficiency. 
 

==================================================================
=== Ranger ===

A Ranger is a combination of a warrior and a mage who has
developed a special affinity for the natural world around him. He is
a good fighter, and the best of the classes with a missile weapon
such as a bow. A ranger has a good stealth, good perception,
good searching, a good saving throw and is good with magical
devices. 

A Ranger's primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity since these
affect his spell casting ability and his ability with his bow but,
as a fighter, Strength and Constitution are important too. As a
ranger's experience increases, so does his skill with his primary
weapon - the bow. A ranger will gain an additional shot with a bow
at level 20 and another at level 40. Unfortunately, because a ranger
is really a dual class character, more experience is required for
him to advance through the levels. 

All rangers are trained in Nature magic, and all Nature spells are
available to them. They even learn these spells almost as fast as
mages. They can also select a secondary realm and may choose
from any realm except Life magic, but they are slow learners of
the second realm, and may find themselves unable to learn some
of the highest level spells. 

 
==================================================================
=== Paladin ===

A Paladin is a combaination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins are
very good fighters, second only to the warrior class, but not very
good at missile weapons. A paladin lacks much in the way of
abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical
devices but has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance. 

A paladin's primary stats are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and
Wisdom since he must both fight and pray for divine intervention.
The paladin receives prayers at a slower pace then the priest, but
can receive even the most powerful prayers although at a higher
cost and fail rate. Unlike priests, Paladins do not learn a second
magic realm. Because a paladin is really a dual class character,
more experience is required for him to advance through the levels.

There are two types of Paladins: those trained in Life magic and
their evil counterparts (the 'Death Knights') who are trained in
Death magic. An 'ordinary' paladin will gain experience for
destroying high-level spellbooks from all the magic realms except
Life. A Death Knight, on the other hand, is very tolerant of the
other realms and will only gain experience for destroying
high-level Life books. 

As a Paladin gains in experience he will become more confident in
his abilities to defeat his enemies and in his deity's power to
protect him. As a result, Paladin's become resistant to fear at level
40. 

==================================================================
=== Warrior-Mage ===

A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross
between the warrior and mage classes. While their brothers, the
rangers, specialize in Nature magic and survival skills, true
Warrior-Mages attempt to reach the best of both worlds. As
warriors they are much superior to the usual Mage class. 

The Warrior-Mage is recommended for the players who want to
cast spells but whose mages tend to die too quickly. However, the
power does not come without a price as Warrior-Mages require
more experience to advance levels than any other class. 

Warrior-mages begin the game with Arcane magic, and they can
freely select another realm of magic. Although they do not gain
new spells as fast as regular mages, they will eventually learn
every spell in both realms, thus making a very competitive choice
for players who appreciate Arcane magic. 


==================================================================
=== Chaos Warrior ===

Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon
Lords of Chaos. Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon and,
when gaining a level, may receive a reward from his Patron. He
might be healed or polymorphed, his stats could be increased, or
he might be rewarded with an awesome weapon. His Patron
Demon might, for some reason, get annoyed with him and do
something fairly nasty like surround him with monsters, drain his
stats or wreck his equipment or they might simply ignore him.
The Demon Lords of Chaos are chaotic and unpredictable indeed.
The exact type of reward depends on both the Patron Demon
(different Demons give different rewards) and chance. 

Chaos Warriors are, as one might expect, trained in Chaos magic.
They are not interested in anyother form of magic. They can learn
every Chaos spell. 

As a chaos-warrior gains in experience, he becomes more confident
of his ability to defeat his enemies and will learn to resist
fear at level 40. In addition, as a result of their prolonged
service to the Demon Lords of Chaos, a chaos-warror will learn
to resist the effects of ahaos attacks at level 30. 


==================================================================
=== Monk ===

The Monk character class is very different from all other classes.
Although they can use weapons and armour just like any other
class, their training in martial arts makes them much more
powerful with no armour or weapons. To gain the resistances
necessary for survival at higher levels a monk may need to wear
some kind of armour, but if the armour he wears is too heavy, it
will severely disturb his martial arts maneuvers. 

As a monk gains in experience he learns, new, powerful forms of
attack and is able to land more blows per round. His defensive
capabilities increase likewise. Fortunately, the amount of armour a
monk can wear, while still fighting efficiently, also increases with
experience. 

In addition, the monk's agility allows him to resist paralyzing
attacks once he reaches level 25 but only if his armor is not
restricting his movement. Monk's are able to move quickly and
will become faster as they gain experience at the rate of one point
for each 10 levels they gain. 

The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of
magic. The typical monk is interested in the harmony of ature, and
studies Nature magic . An idealist monk would select Life magic,
and try work to benefit his neighbour. But there are also dark
monks, who practice Death magic. A monk will eventually learn
all prayers in the discipline of their choice.

==================================================================
=== Mindcrafter ===

The Mindcrafter is a unique class that uses the powers of the
mind instead of magic. These powers are unique to Mindcrafters,
and vary from simple extrasensory powers to mental domination
of others. Since these powers are developed by the practice of
certain disciplines, a Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use
them. The available powers are simply determined by the
character's level. 

A Mindcrafter's primary stat is wisdom since this is used to
determine how well he / she can perform the psychic powers, and
in combat a Mindcrafter is roughly the equivalent of a priest.
Unlike the priest, however, a Mindcrafter is never penalized for
wielding an edged weapon. 

Although the powers of a Mindcrafter may seem like magic, this is
not -- strictly speaking -- the case. They are mental powers,
independent of the ordinary sources of magic. Consequently,
Mindcrafters are not interested in 'magic' and learn no spells or
prayers. 

As a Mindcrafter's experience increases, so does his ability to
control his body with his mind as do his mental powers. A
mindcrafter will learn to control his fear at level 10 and to
resist becoming confused at level 30. His practice of mental
discipline will mean that by level 20 his wisdom will be sustained
and at level 40 he will gain the power of telepathy. 


==================================================================
=== High Mage ===

High mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of
magic and learn it very well -- much better than the ordinary
mage. For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, they
gain substantial benefits in the mana costs, minimum levels, and
failure rates in the spells of the realm of their specialty. 

A high mage's prime prime statistic is intelligence as this
determines his spell casting ability. Good wisdom and dexterity
also help. There is no rule that says a high mage cannot become a
good fighter, but spells are the mage's true strength. With two
notable exceptions, high mages should avoid wearing armor on
their hands as this can restrict their spell casting ability. 

High mages may freely choose any realm but it should be noted
that a high mage specializing in Life Magic will not learn it
as well as a priest.

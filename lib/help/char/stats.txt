STATISTICS

Each character has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the
abilities of the character in a variety of ways.  Every stat
has a numerical value, ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a
normal maximum of 18, and even higher, into the "percentile"
range, represented as "18/01" through "18/100".  Actually,
every stat can be raised even above 18/100 by magical means,
up to a pure maximum of 18/220, which is represented as "18/***".

Traditionally, a percentile stat such as "18/50" has been
thought of as representing a value part way between 18 and 19,
and this is one way to think of them.  However, often, the best
way to view the "bonus" values after the "18/" is as "tenth"
points, since it often takes the same magic to raise a stat
from, say, 4 to 5, or 16 to 17, as it does from, say, 18/40
to 18/50.  The important thing to remember is that almost all
internal calculations "ignore" the final digit of any "bonus",
so that, for example, "18/40" and "18/49" are always have
the same effects.

During character generation, each stat is rolled out as a
number from 8 to 17, with a normal distribution, and is then
immediately modified based on the race and class of the character.

=== Strength ===

Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee
combat.  A high strength can improve your chances of hitting
as well as the amount of damage done with each hit.  Char-
acters with low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength
is also useful in tunneling and in carrying heavy items.
 
=== Intelligence ===

Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like
spellcasters, mages, rangers, and rogues.  Intelligence
will affect the number of spells you may learn each level as
well as the number of spell points you receive.  A high
intelligence may also improve your chances of successfully
casting a spell.  You cannot learn spells if your intelligence
is 7 or lower.  A good intelligence can also help with using
magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.
 
=== Wisdom ===

The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability
of a priest or paladin to use prayers, just like intelligence
affects spellcasting.  Again, high wisdom will increase the
number of spell points you have and increase the number of
prayers you can learn each level, while improving the chance
that a prayer will be successful.  A good wisdom can also
help to improve your chances of resisting magical spells cast
upon you by monsters.
 
=== Dexterity ===

Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and
will increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and
dodging blows from enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in
picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from
some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons.
 
=== Constitution ===

Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
character with a high constitution will receive more hit
points and also recover them faster while resting.
 
=== Charisma ===

Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
appearance.  A character with a high charisma will receive
better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a
very low charisma may be robbed blind.  A high charisma will
also mean more starting money for the character.

 Mutations
 =========

 This spoiler was written by Chase Tingley based on the source for ZAngband 
 2.2.2c.  It may be inaccurate for other versions.  Portions of the text are
 taken from Remco Gerlich's ZAngband 2.1.1c mutate.spo, which inspired this
 document.  Juergen Neitzel added some little corrections concerning typos,
 filling word gaps and increased readability by arrangement.

 This spoiler gives exact information on the following topics:

 o How can I get mutations?
 o Am I more likely to get some mutations than others?
 o How can I get rid of mutations?
 o What do they do?
    A. Activatable mutations (#1-32)
    B. Randomly activating mutations (#33-64)
    C. "Continuous" mutations (#65-96)
 o Which mutations 'cancel each other out'?


 How can I get mutations?
 ========================

 o By being a Beastman.  
    Get one free at the start of the game.  20% chance of getting another 
    each time you gain a level.  Beastmen = beatdown.

 o By casting Polymorph Self.
    It is not easy to figure out how likely it is to achieve mutations this 
    way, since the polymorph self code could have a short spoiler written on 
    just it. Suffice to say, you are more likely to have multiple effects 
    occur the higher your level; level also affects how likely you are to get 
    any particular effect.  An "effect" could be a new mutation, a change of 
    race, stat rearrangement, wound polymorphing, or becoming an abomination.
    Polymorph Self does 1 or 2 effects, randomly with a 3-in-14 chance of
    getting a random mutation each time. 

 o By using the Polymorph Self mutation.
    Polymorph self does 1 or 2 effects, randomly with a 3-in-14 chance of
    getting a random mutation each time. 

 o By releasing Wild Magic when a Chaos spell fails.
    Depends on the number of the spell. Take 1d(spell number)+1d8+1. If that's 
    27 or 28, gain a mutation.  The other numbers do other things.  This is 
    not the most reliable way to get a mutation.

 o By casting Living Trump.
    1 in 8 times, gives you teleportation at will.  Otherwise, you can emit 
    hard radiation.  I guess a bug's been fixed (old spoiler claimed it was 
    Hypnotic Gaze or Cowardice), but I thought I heard that it was supposed 
    to be voluntary vs random teleportation.  Who knows.  If you're playing 
    Trump Magic, you probably don't mind.  This bug appears to be have 
    been corrected in version 2.2.3.

 o By having your sanity blasted.    
    Two things can do this.  Failing a spell from the Necronomicon gives you 
    a 50% chance of having your sanity blasted.  Eldritch Horrors 
    ("sanity-blasting" creatures) will occasionally produce the same effect.  
    Sanity blasting has many possible effects; one of them is permanent 
    insanity manifested through the acquisition of one of Berserker Rage, 
    Hallucination, Cowardice, or Moronic mutations.  These can be prevented 
    (resist fear prevents Cowardice; resist chaos prevents Hallucination).  
    If you already are afflicted with all four, nothing happens.  As the code 
    says: /* The poor bastard already has all possible insanities! */    

 o Being hit by unresisted Chaos.
    One in three, you get a mutation.  For those who use chaos breathers as a 
    way to get lots of mutations fast, a tip: save yourself some trouble and 
    get nether resist first.  Otherwise, you get hammered with xp drain 25% 
    of the time.

 o By gaining a level as a Chaos Warrior.
    It appears that there is always a 1 in 6 chance of getting a mutation 
    from this.

 o By gaining a level if you have the mutation "Chaos deities give you
    gifts" as some Chaos patrons give random mutations as a level gift
    now and then. 

 o By using wizard mode.
    Give me a break.  If you've resorted to this either you don't need me to 
    tell you how OR I'm not going to (out of general principle).  Two words: 
    Vapor Quest.  That should be enough for anyone.


 Am I more likely to get some mutations than others?
 ===================================================

  Oh yes.  Some mutations are naturally "weighted" -- they occur more often 
  than others. Additionally, certain races are more prone to receiving 
  certain mutations than others.  A list of races with associated mutations, 
  and how likely they are to crop up if you don't have them already:

    Race        Mutation            Probability
    ----        --------            -----------
    Vampire     Hypnotic Gaze       %70
    Imp         Horns               %70
    Yeek        Shrieking           %70
    Mind Flayer Tentacles           %70
    Beastman    Polymorph Self      %20
  
  A lot of people seem to think that the mind flayer shouldn't get the 
  tentacles, since mind flayers already have tentacles.  I'm not sure what 
  the big deal is. It seems that for mind flayers the mutation seems to 
  signify gaining control over these tentacles, such that they can be used as 
  a combat device. I mean, it's an extra attack.  What are people complaining 
  about?

  As for the natural weighting of some mutations over others, I'm not going 
  to bother.  One can only do so much.  


 How do I get rid of mutations?
 ==============================

The only ways to *get rid of* mutation(s) are: 

 o Chaos Tower (town bldg) -- supports the Remove Mutation function.  
 o Quaff a potion of New Life -- removes all mutations.
 o Polymorph Self spell/mutation -- occasionally removes one mutation. 
 o Get a mutation that cancels the mutation out -- see below

 o Cast the Trump spell Shuffle.
    ...and getting the "Judgement" card - effect 101-110. Your effect number 
    is 1d120, except if you're a High Mage or a Rogue, when it's 
    1d110+level/5.  This will remove all mutations.

 o Periodically, through the "Normalcy" mutation ("You feel oddly normal...").
    One in 5000 chance, checked every 10 game turns.  Randomly removes one 
    mutation.  This mutation can also remove itself.


 What do they do?
 ================

  Oh man. There are currently 96 mutations. Prepare for some action from the 
  back section.  

  First of all a warning - Zangband 2.2.2d introduced a penalty for
  having too many mutations. The first few are free but thereafter
  your regeneration rate is reduced as further mutations are added.
  Beastmen are largely exempted from this but, strangely, Chaos
  Warriors are not. 

  There are four kinds of mutations: activatable mutations, randomly
  activating mutations, 'continuous' mutations and melee-attack
  mutations. 


 A. Activatable mutations
 ------------------------

 Explanation of the STR14@6 notation can be found in the racial abilities 
 spoiler.

 Before using these powers you must first pass a success roll.
 The calculation is messy and so I've omitted it for that reason. 

 There are four important statistics for activatable mutations:
   (1) the cost (in mana for spell casters and hitpoints otherwise)
       to use the power gtranted by the mutation;
   (2) a stat which is used in determining your chance of success;
   (3) the minimum level required to use the power; and 
   (4) the 'difficulty' of using the power. 

  The actual calculation of the fail rates for using the activatable
  powers is very messy but a good rule of thumb is if the relevant
  stat is below the difficulty (18/50 --> 18+50=68), you have little
  chance of success. 

 1. "You can spit acid (dam lvl).", cost 9, DEX 15@9
    Fires an acid ball.  Damage (level), radius 1+(level/30).

 2. "You can breathe fire (dam lvl * 2).", cost lvl, CON 18@20
    Fireball, damage (level*2), radius 1+(level/20).

 3. "Your gaze is hypnotic.", cost 12, CHR 18@12
    Tries to charm a monster.  Success dependent on level.

 4. "You are telekinetic.", cost 9, WIS 14@9
    Move an object within line-of-sight to you. Weight limit of (level) pounds.

 5. "You can teleport at will.", cost 7, WIS 15@7
    Teleport player 10 + 4*(level) squares.

 6. "You can Mind Blast your enemies.", cost 3, WIS 15@7
    Fires a psionic bolt, damage 3+((level - 1)/5)d3.  This is psionic 
    damage -- see the mindcrafter spoiler.

 7. "You can emit hard radiation at will.", cost 15, CON 14@15
    Fires a damage level*2, radius 3+level/20 "nuke" ball.  This is poison 
    damage that can also polymorph monsters.

 8. "You can drain life from a foe like a vampire.", cost lvl, CON 14@13
    Does level*2 drain life damage.  Heals level+random(level) hitpoints if 
    successful.  Also acts as food, gaining 100 food "points"/hp drained (a 
    food ration is 5000 food points).  This can never make you more than 
    "full". Doesn't work on demons, undead, nonliving monsters, and on 
    elementals ('E'), golems ('g') and vortices ('v').

 9. "You can smell nearby precious metal.", cost 2, INT 12@3
    Detects treasure.

10. "You can smell nearby monsters.", cost 4, INT 15@5
    Detects non-invisible monsters.  

11. "You can teleport yourself short distances.", cost 3, WIS 12@3
    Phase door, distance 10.

12. "You can consume solid rock.", cost 12, CON 18@8
    One of the best ideas for a mutation ever.  Some types of rock (mountains, 
    permanent rock) may not be eaten.  Closed doors and rubble yield 3000 food 
    (a food ration is 5000), quartz and magma veins are 5000, and granite is 
    10000.  You may not eat trees.  Unlike draining life, it appears that it 
    is not only possible but easy to gorge yourself.

13. "You can switch locations with another being.", cost 12, DEX 16@15
    Switch positions with a monster of your choosing.  If the monster resists 
    teleportation, you may not switch positions with it.

14. "You can emit a horrible shriek.", cost 4, CON 6@4
    Sound ball, damage 4*(level), radius 8, centered on you.  This can also 
    disturb monsters.

15. "You can emit bright light.", cost 2, INT 10@3
    Identical to various Light spells.  Lights the toom, does 2d(level/2) 
    light damage to light-sensistive creatures within radius (level/10)+1.

16. "You can feel the danger of evil magic.", cost 14, WIS 14@7
    Adds {cursed} to all cursed items inventory.

17. "You can drive yourself into a berserk frenzy.", cost 8, STR 14@8
    Go berserk!  Adds 30 to hp, cures fear, and sends player into a battle 
    rage. Lasts 1d25+25 turns.

18. "You can polymorph yourself at will.", cost 20, CON 18@18
    Functions just like the polymorph self spell.

19. "You can turn ordinary items to gold.", cost 5, INT 12@10
    Identical to other alchemy effects.  Turns one item from inventory or 
    floor to gold worth 1/3 of the item's store value, with a maximum of 
    30000 gold that can be gained per item.  Artifacts may not be turned to 
    gold.  Objects which are worth nothing are turned into "fool's gold."

20. "You can cause molds to grow near you.", cost 6, CON 14@1
    This is a strange one. Attempts to summon eight molds -- enough to fill 
    every square nearby. I was going to make a joke about it: This should be 
    changed to "Grow Slime Molds" (in order to please Aidan Ryder), but 
    someone on r.g.r.a beat me to it.

21. "You can harden yourself to the ravages of the elements.", cost 12, 
    CON 12@10
    Randomly gain (level/5) resistances from a choice of acid, cold, fire, 
    electricity, poison for 1d20+20 turns.

22. "You can bring down the dungeon around your ears.", cost 12, STR 16@12
    Radius 10 earthquake centered on player.

23. "You can consume magic energy for your own use.", cost 1, WIS 15@17
    Consume charges from magical items to replenish spell points.

24. "You can feel the strength of the magics affecting you.", cost 6, INT 10@6
    Displays a report of all magical effects currently active for the player, 
    included estimates of how long they will last ("for a little while", etc).  
    Magical effects include: blind, confused, afraid, poisoned, hallucinating, 
    blessed, heroic, battle rage, protected from evil, protected by a mystic 
    shield, invulnerable, incorporeal, hands are glowing dull red (confuse 
    monsters), waiting to be recalled, and resistant to acid, electricity, 
    fire, cold, or poison.

25. "You can cause mass impotence.", cost 40, CHR 18@20
    Appears to prevent breeders on the level from breeding further.  
    Causes a headache in player figure, damage 1d30+30.

26. "You can run for your life after hitting something.", cost 12, DEX 14@10
    Permits to attack an adjacent monster and then immediately will teleport 
    you with range 30 before anything else happens. This sounds sort of cool.

27. "You can emit confusing, blinding radiation.", cost 15, CHR 8@7
    Attempts to stun, confuse, and terrify all visible monsters.

28. "Your eyes can fire laser beams.", cost 10, WIS 9@7
    Fires light beam, damage 2*(level).

29. "You can travel between town and the depths.", cost 50, INT 16@17
    Word of recall.

30. "You can send evil cre atures directly to Hell.", cost 25, WIS 18@25
    Causes an evil monster to disappear -- it doesn't die, so there's no drop,
    but it's gone off the level.  Possible bug: does this work on uniques?  
    I don't see why it wouldn't from the code, but I'm not sure it should.  
    This seems like a topic for debate.

31. "You can freeze things with a touch.", cost 2, CON 11@2
    Cold attack, damage 2*(level).

32. "You can hurl objects with great force.", cost lev, STR 6@1
    Gives you a damage multiplier on a thrown object.  The multiplier starts 
    at x2 at 1st level, and rises to x5 at 48th level.


 B. Randomly activating mutations
 --------------------------------

 A check for these is made every 10 game turns (1 player turn at normal speed).
 Most of these effects disturb resting, which is very annoying.

33. "You are subject to berserker fits."
    1 in 3000 chance of berserker rage for 10+1d(level) turns.

34. "You are subject to cowardice."
    1 in 3000 chance of becoming afraid for 13+1d26 turns.  Resist fear, 
    active heroism, or active berserker rage will negate this.

35. "You are teleporting randomly."
    1 in 5000 chance of teleportation, range 40.  Anti-teleportation, resist 
    nexus, or the voluntary teleportation mutation will prevent this.

36. "Your body produces alcohol."
    1 in 6400 chance of falling into a drunken stupor.  If you fall into a 
    drunken stupor, you have a 1 in 20 chance of forgetting the map and 
    teleporting with range 100, with an additional 1 in 3 chance of a total 
    mind blank.  Otherwise, become confused for 15+1d20 turns, with a 1 in 3 
    chance of hallucinating for 150+1d150 turns.  Resist chaos or confusion 
    will prevent falling into a drunken stupor.

37. "You have a hallucinatory insanity."
    1 in 6400 chance of hallucinating for 20+1d50 turns.  Resist chaos 
    prevents you from it.

38. "You are subject to uncontrollable flatulence."
    1 in 3000 generate a radius 3 flatulence ball centered on player.  This 
    is a poison ball that does (level) damage.

39. "You have a scorpion tail (poison, 3d7)."
    An extra attack, doing 3d7 poison damage.  Counts as weight 5 for 
    critical hits.

40. "You have horns (dam. 2d6)."
    An extra attack, doing 2d6 damage.  Counts as weight 15 for critical hits.

41. "You have a beak (dam. 2d4)."
    An extra attack, doing 2d4 damage.  Counts as weight 5 for critical hits.   

42. "You attract demons."
    1 in 6666 chance of attracting a demon.  1 in 6 chance of it being a pet, 
    otherwise watch out.  The demon is summoned based on dungeon level.  
    Anti-magic prevents demons from being summoned.

43. "You are producing magical energy uncontrollably."
    1 in 9000 chance of producing a mana ball, radius 3, damage 2*(level).  
    Mana is pure (unresistable) damage, and destroys items on the floor. 
    Anti-magic prevents this from happening.

44. "You move faster or slower randomly."
    1 in 6000 chance each check.  1 in 2 chance of slowing you for 10+1d30 
    turns (or cancel any magical hasting that you have), otherwise haste for 
    10+1d30 turns (or cancel slowness).

45. "You sometimes cause nearby creatures to vanish."
    1 in 9000 chance each check.  Teleports all visible creatures away, range 
    100.  If this happens in town, one of the shopkeepers will "run for the 
    hills"  and that shop (randomly selected) will be shuffled.

46. "You sometimes feed off of the light around you."
    A strange one; 1 in 3000 chance each check.  Contrary to what you might 
    think, this heals you, rather than acting as food.  Heal 10hp from being 
    in a lit area.  Then gain 1/20th of the remaining turns of your light in 
    hitpoints, and cut the remaining turns of the light in half.  This does 
    not work with artifact light sources.  Then darkens the area (radius 10) 
    around the player and does 50 points of damage to every affected monster.

47. "You have an elephantine trunk (dam 1d4)."
    An extra attack, doing 1d4 damage.  Counts as weight 35 for critical hits.  

48. "You attract animals."
    1 in 7000 chance unless you have anti-magic.  Summons an animal 
    (determined by dungeon level), 1 in 3 chance of it being a pet.

49. "You have evil looking tentacles (dam 2d5)."
    An extra attack, doing 2d5 damage.  Counts as weight 5 for critial
    hits.  Counts as a hellfire attack, doing double damage to evil.

50. "You occasionally are surrounded with raw chaos."
    1 in 8000 chance, unless you have anti-magic.  Causes a radius 8 chaos 
    ball centered on player, damage (level).  I fantasize that this is caused 
    by uncontrollable body odor sparking outbreaks of Logrus.

51. "You may be mutated, but you're recovering."
    1 in 5000 chance each check.  Removes a mutation.

52. "You fade in and out of physical reality."
    1 in 3000 chance unless you have anti-magic.  Become wraith-form for 
    (level/2)+1d(level/2) turns.

53. "Your health is subject to chaotic forces."
    1 in 3000 chance of polymorphing wounds.

54. "You have a horrible wasting disease." 
    1 in 3000 chance of randomly decreasing one stat, unless that stat is 
    sustained.  1 in 3 chance of decreasing the max value as well.

55. "You attract dragons."
    1 in 3000 chance unless you have anti-magic.  Summons a dragon based on 
    dungeon level, 1 in 5 chance of being a pet.

56. "Your mind randomly expands and contracts."
    1 in 3000 chance unless you have anti-magic.  Grants ESP for (level) 
    turns, or takes it away if you already have temporary ESP.

57. "You have a seriously upset stomach."
    1 in 9000 chance unless you have slow digestion.  Empties your stomach; 
    your food level goes down to "Weak."

58. "Chaos deities give you gifts."
    Players gains rewards from chaos deities during level gain, just like 
    Chaos Warriors.

59. "You occasionally stumble into other shadows."
    1 in 12000 chance unless you have anti-magic.  Re-creates the level, 
    similar to the Alter Reality spell.

60. "You receive warnings about your foes."
    1 in 1000.  Goes through the list of all the monsters on the level and 
    keeps a total of how much higher their levels than that of the player.  
    Then gives a sort of "monster-only level feeling" based on the total 
    difference:
    
    Total   Message
    -----   -------
    >100    You feel utterly terrified!
    >50     You feel terrified!
    >20     You feel very worried!
    >10     You feel paranoid!
    >5      You feel almost safe.
    <=5     You feel lonely.

61. "You occasionally feel invincible."
    1 in 5000 chance unless you have anti-magic.  Grants invulnerability for    
    8+1d8 turns.  It is a universally recognized fact that this effect will 
    activate if you are in town, and never when the cyberdemons appear.
62. "Your blood sometimes rushes to your muscles."
    1 in 2000 chance.  Player loses spellpoints in order to heal -- each sp 
    heals one hp.
63. "Your blood sometimes rushes to your head."
    1 in 4000 chance.  Player loses hitpoints and recovers spellpoints 
    -- 1 for 1.
64. "You occasionally stumble and drop things."
    1 in 10000 chance.  Trip, taking 1d(player weight/6) damage, and drop the 
    weapon you are wielding.
    
 C. "Continuous" mutations
 -------------------------

 Almost all of these explain themselves.

 65. "You are superhumanly strong (+4 STR)."
 66. "You are puny (-4 STR)."
 67. "Your brain is a living computer (+4 INT/WIS)."
 68. "You are moronic (-4 INT/WIS)."
 69. "You are very resilient (+4 CON)." 
 70. "You are extremely fat (+2 CON, -2 speed)."
 71. "You are albino (-4 CON)."
 72. "Your flesh is rotting (-2 CON, -1 CHR)."
 73. "Your voice is a silly squeak (-4 CHR)."
 74. "Your face is featureless (-1 CHR)."

 75. "Your appearance is masked with illusion."
    Guarantees a CHR of 10-18/90, dependent on level.  If CHR is lower than 
    8+2*(level), it is raised to 8+2*(level).  [Note: This may seem a bit 
    weird if you're not familiar with how the game represents stats, but 
    trust me.  20 = 18/02, 108 = 18/90, etc.]

 76. "You have an extra pair of eyes (+15 search)."

 77. "You are resistant to magic."
    Adds 15+(level/3) to saving throw.

 78. "You make a lot of strange noise (-3 stealth)."
 79. "You have remarkable infravision (+3 infravision)."
 80. "You have an extra pair of legs (+3 speed)."
 81. "Your legs are short stubs (-3 speed)."

 82. "Electricity is running through your veins."
    Electrical aura, similar to other effects.
    Does 2d6 electricity damage to any monster that hits you. 

 83. "Your body is enveloped in flames." 
    Grants a fire aura.  Does 2d6 fire damage to any monster that hits you.
    Also gives permanent light (radius 1). 

 84. "Your skin is covered with warts (-2 CHR, +5 AC)."
 85. "Your skin has turned into scales (-1 CHR, +10 AC)."
 86. "Your skin is made of steel (-1 DEX, +25 AC)."
 87. "You have wings."  (Levitation)
 88. "You are completely fearless."  (Resist Fear)
 89. "You are regenerating."  (Regeneration)
 90. "You are telepathic."  (Telepathy)
 91. "Your body is very limber (+3 DEX)."
 92. "Your joints ache constantly (-3 DEX)."

 93. "You are protected from the ravages of time."
    Possibly the biggest beatings you can get in a mutation.  Acts as 
    unofficial time resistance; damage from time attacks is reduced by 33-66% 
    (damage * 4 /(6+1d6)), and you won't get those damn side effects either.

 94. "You are susceptible to damage from the elements."
    Take double damage from cold, fire, acid, and electricity attacks.  

 95. "Your movements are precise and forceful (+1 Stealth)."
    Also grants free action.

 96. "Your body resists serious damage."     
    Sustains one or more stats, depending on level:
    
    Stat    Sustained at Level
    ----    ------------------
    CON     Always
    STR     10
    DEX     20

 Which mutations 'cancel each other out'?
 ========================================

Gaining certain mutations may remove other ones. For example, if you
are moronic and gain "computer brain", your moronic mutation will be
gone. Later in the game, you can become a moron again, and lose
"computer brain" in the process. These cancel each other out. 

A full list of mutations that cancel each other out is as follows: 

 o   Puny and Super-strong [Superhuman].
 o   Moronic and Computer Brain.
 o   Steel [Iron] Skin cancels Scales, Warts and Rotting Flesh.
     Warts, Scales, or Rotting Flesh cancel Steel [Iron] Skin.
 o   Fearlessness and Cowardice.
 o   Rotting Flesh and Regeneration.
 o   Limber Joints [Limberness] and Arthritis.
 o   Beak replaces Trunk and vice versa.

#####R=== Unbelievers ===

#####GDescription
The full opposite of sorcerors, unbelievers so strongly despise magic 
that not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all 
training in the use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally 
incompetent when trying to use a magic item. In addition, they are so 
unattuned to magic that summoning gates are incapable of opening around
them (in a radius that grows larger with their level), eventually 
extending to a complete suppression of teleportation abilities in the 
area around them.

#####GPrimary Stats
Strength
Constitution

#####GMagic Usage
Unbelievers are not capable of using magic themselves, but due to their
extreme level of disbelief in magic, they are capable of disrupting the
magic of those around them. They radiate an anti-magic field around 
themselves which continually grows larger as they become more 
experienced. Also, they are capable of preventing *any* teleportation
from occurring on the level they are currently on, using the 'm' 
command. And since most traps have some magical nature, they are also
capable of detecting them.

Special weapons known as darkswords are the chosen weapons of 
Unbelievers, and give a 50% boost to their antimagic shell. Be warned
however, that [[[[[Bany] enchanting of these swords irrevocably 
destroys their antimagic bonus!

    A ring of resist fear

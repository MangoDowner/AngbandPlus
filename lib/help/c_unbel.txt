#####R=== Unbelievers ===

#####GDescription
The full opposite of sorcerors, unbelievers so strongly despise magic 
that not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all 
training in the use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally 
incompetent when trying to use a magic item.

#####GAntimagic
Thought carries power. And since Unbelievers think that magic doesn't
exist, they can suppress its manifestation around them. High levels of
proficiency in antimagic allow them to stabilize the space-time continuum,
so preventing teleportation, and even to sense the magical emanations
coming from traps.

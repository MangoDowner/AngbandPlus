============================= Symbols On Your Map =============================

     Angband and many of its variants, including FAangband, allow you to use
either ASCII (text) characters or graphics to represent the world around you.
Using text characters has the great advantage of allowing instant on-line 
identification of any symbol you see.  Type '/', then the character.  Also, 
you may consult the following tables of symbols, divided into dungeon features,
objects, and monsters:

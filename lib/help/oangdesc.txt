
                        Welcome to Opinion Angband!

     Opinion Angband, or Oangband for short, is one of the many variants of 
Angband.  It was created to accomplish exactly two things:  Teach L.M. C
programming, and turn a new conception of non-magical combat into a game you
can enjoy.  As you will shortly discover, however, Oangband has developed a 
life of its own.  A selection of features includes:


-The elimination of years of slow HP and damage inflation, and a "tabula rasa" 
approach to game balance in general.  

-A fundamentally altered conception of physical combat.

-A radically revised magical system, offering you the chance to play any of 
four spellcasters, any of four warrior-spellcasters, or the pure warrior we 
all know and love.

-Very much more varied classes.  Mages are great with magical items, Rogues 
steal and set traps, Assassins whip poisoned knives at their foes, Paladins 
smite with elemental powers, Priests evoke the power of Holy Light, and 
Necromancers just blast everything in sight.  

-Races are also more differentiated.  There are three new races, including 
one designed especially for new players.

-More ways to combat monsters.  Now you really can start and win the game 
relying on magic, melee, shooting, throwing, or magical devices to do 
damage to your foes.

-All sorts of new monster nastiness.  Dragons are dangerous once more, 
Undead have a deadly touch, Trolls will gleefully pelt you to death with 
boulders, and those Zephyr Hounds are *nuts*.

-Enhanced object description and learning code.

-dungeon features that affect movement, sighting, and combat.

-exciting chests and nasty traps.

-More varied dungeons, including "Interesting Rooms", new room types, and 
themed levels.

-One-slot wand and rod stacking, arc spells, themed random artifacts, and 
player ghosts that challenge you to mortal combat.

-New just about everything.  Whether it be Wands of Storms, the Dark Elven 
Smith Eol, Shields of Night and Day, Athelas, new vaults, rods of Northwinds, 
Large Jeweled Chests, or activatable rings, Oangband has novelty enough for 
anyone.

-And Angband-compatible savefiles.


If you feel the need for more detail, I'd suggest just perusing the help 
files.  If you like, you will find a .diff file In the "lib/info" folder that 
lists (most) of the changes between Oangband 0.3.2 and 0.4.0, in more detail 
than you really want to know.  A complete listing of Oangband .diffs files can 
be found at the Oangband development site.


=== The Jaded Angband Player's Guide to Oangband ===

-Don't think a whip will instantly make you a combat machine.
-Don't ignore combat magic and spells that hinder monsters.
-Melee requires as much backpack space as magic.
-Don't try to melee or shoot with the pros if you haven't the Skill to swing it.
-Forget about blows.  Everybody gets two for a long time.
-don't ignore infravision, searching, and perception.
-Don't go into autopilot and sell every damage-dealing wand, staff, or rod you 
 see.
-Useful utility magics aren't only found in spellbooks and rods.
-And never, never, never, think this game is fair.  It's not.

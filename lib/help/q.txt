VAMPIRE
---------

Vampires are undeads who were once living humans, elves
and other humanoid races. Either having been bitten by
a vampire lord, or having been turned into vampires by
powerful necromancers, these undead creatures roams the
darkness in search for blood. As undeads, they possesses
many resistances and have an innate regeneration. However,
vampires get little from normal food, and must drink
the blood of their opponents to survive, which means
approaching them and drinking their fresh blood.

ADVANTAGES: +25% to darkness type attacks.
            Cannot be poisoned, stunned and cannot bleed.
	    Innate immunity to cold
	    Innate resistance to darkness, nether, chaos and poison
	    Innate resistance to fear, confusion and black breath
	    Innate resistance to experience draining
	    Innate regeneration

DISADVANTAGES: Must drink blood from opponents to eat. To do so, they
	       use the "Drain Life" ability. It's a physical attack,
	       and it heals the vampire AND feed him 30 hp and 100 food
	       per levels. It also deals 30 physical damages/level to
	       the enemy.

	       Cannot wear a light source.
	       Vampires are damaged by day light in the town.

ELITES AND BOSS MONSTERS
-----------------------------

New to NewAngband 1.2.1(and higher) are the Elites and Boss monsters. 
These are stronger monsters that will require more skill to kill than 
normal monsters. When generated, monsters have 20% chances to become elites. 
And an elite has 20% chances to turn into a boss. Here's a detailed

- Gain multiple randomly chosen ability.

ABILITIES
-----------
Elites and Bosses can gain random abilities. Here's more information on these
abilities:

WEAPON IMMUNITY: These monsters aren't affected by weapons, so don't waste
your time trying to kill them with a sword, no matter how strong your sword
is.

MAGIC IMMUNITY: These monsters aren't affected by magical/energical attacks.
Even pure magic won't work against them.
NOTE: A boss cannot get both Weapon and Magic immunity.

DAMAGE RESISTANT: In addition to the damage resistance provided by the
monster's level, these monsters will gain an additional 50% damage resistance
for both weapons and magics.

DOUBLE DAMAGES: These monsters do twice more damages than they would normally
do. This only apply to melee attacks.

DOUBLE MAGIC: These monsters do twice more damages with their spells/breath.

CURSED HITS: When you're hit by a monster with this ability, you have 50%
chances of becoming Confused, Scared and Blind, even if you're resistant
to these effects.

RETURNING: If you hit a monster with this ability with a melee weapon, you
will receive 50% of the damages you caused with your weapon. This apply to
each blows you give to a monster, so beware!

MAGIC RETURNING: Like returning, but for spells and magic damages.


One last thing that is important to know is that Unique monsters cannot
become elites or bosses. You might get happy now, because you know Variaz
won't get any abilities, right? Don't worry, Variaz has his own, extremely
nasty abilities...

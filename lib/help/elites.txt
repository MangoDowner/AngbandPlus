ELITES AND BOSS MONSTERS
-----------------------------

Elites and Boss enemies are stronger versions of the regular enemies.
20% of the time, a normal enemy will be an Elite version of that enemy.
If the monster turns into an Elite, then there's a 20% chance that
this Elite turn into a boss. These monsters are typically much more
difficult to defeat than their regular counterparts, having higher
hp, better stats, and more importantly, one or more special abilities.

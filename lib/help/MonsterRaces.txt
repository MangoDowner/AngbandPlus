=== Monster Races ===

***** <Jelly>
--- Jelly ---

  Jellies are acidic creatures, quietly patrolling their surroundings in search
  of objects to absorb. They are quite stealthy for most of their lives. They
  don't wear equipment on their bodies the way normal races do. Instead, they
  are capable of absorbing objects into their gelatinous frames. In fact, each
  equipment slot (except their pseudopod) is capable of holding any type of
  equipment whatsoever, and the number of slots increases with experience. For
  attacking, jellies are capable of forming a single pseudopod which they may
  either use for grasping a normal melee weapon, or leave empty to use their
  innate acid based attacks.
   
  Jellies are monsters and cannot pick a normal player class. Lacking a mouth,
  they are unable to speak. Lacking eyes, they are unable to see so cannot use
  magical scrolls which they would be too stupid to read anyway. On the plus
  side, their lack of normal vision makes them immune to blindness. Rather than
  relying on sight, jellies use a little understood sense of their surroundings
  which allows them to see in the dark with neither light nor infravision. So
  while jellies can equip a torch or lantern, there is little reason for them
  to do so.
   
  Jellies feed off the objects they find gaining nutrition in proportion to the
  weight of the object absorbed. They can eat rations of food if desired, but
  these are so light as to offer very little nutritional value. Jellies prefer
  to eat heavy armors and weapons. For convenience, destroying an object ('k'
  or the autodestroyer) automatically eats the object, and jellies never become
  bloated, their appetite being insatiable.
   
  Like all monster races, jellies begin as weak monster of their race and
  evolve to better forms as they gain experience. Jellies begin life as a small
  puddle of black ooze with very little carrying capacity for equipment.
  However, they quickly evolve into a Gelatinous Cube and then into an Acidic
  Cytoplasm. Jellies take one additional powerful evolutionary step late in
  life.


***** <Spider>
--- Spider ---

  Spiders are stealthy monsters that prefer to wait for their prey. They have
  poisonous attacks and can weave sticky webs to entangle their enemies. They
  have 8 legs, 4 of which may wear rings and the remaining may equip 2 pairs of
  boots. They are unable to wield weapons or bows, but may wear a helmet, an
  amulet, a cloak and even a suit of body armor (after slight adjustments, of
  course). They cannot wield a light source, but this is not an issue as
  spiders have grown accustomed to the dark.
   
  There are two paths of evolution for the spider: The Phase Spider and The
  Aranea. The former is somewhat weaker than the latter in fortitude, stats and
  melee, but this is compensated by the Phase Spider's amazing powers of
  teleportation. However, the Elder Aranea's poison touch is more powerful than
  that of the Phase Spider and often paralyzes its opponents.
   
  All spiders begin in the very weak form of the Cave Spider. Lacking any
  special talents, the cave spider must play carefully if it is to survive.


***** <Dragon>
--- Dragon ---

  Dragons are powerful winged serpents. They are the strongest fighters with
  razor sharp claws and a bone crushing bite. Each dragon has a unique type of
  breath that becomes more deadly as the dragon grows and matures.
   
  Due to their non-humanoid bodies, dragons are unable to wear armor, gloves or
  boots. However, being creatures of magic, they are able to wear 6 rings. They
  can also wear a helmet, a light source, a cloak and an amulet. Because of
  these equipment restrictions, dragons may have a difficult time covering all
  resistances despite the fact that each dragon has one or more innate
  resistances (or even immunities).
   
  Dragons begin life in a weak form, being very young. As their bodies mature,
  their scales grow tough and their claws sharp. Their breath grows more deadly
  and they frequently gain additional magical powers and resistances. All
  dragons can fly, but younger dragons are not so quick as their elders.


***** <Lich>
--- Lich ---

  Liches are the undead forms of former sorcerers. Their magic is strong but
  their fighting is weak. As undead, they quickly gain resistance to cold,
  poison and nether, and these resistances increase as the lich evolves.
   
  Liches are monsters and cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they are born
  with magical powers and gain additional powers as they advance. Of all the
  monster races, none can surpass the firepower of an Archlich, but managing to
  evolve that far can be a challenge. Intelligence is the primary spell stat.
   
  Liches are humanoid so use the standard set of equipment items. Should they
  forgo the use of a normal weapon, they may touch their opponents for various
  powerful effects. However, melee is not the strong suit of the Lich and even
  their deadly touch is often not enough.


***** <Xorn>
--- Xorn ---

  Xorn are huge creatures of the element earth. They begin life as an Umber
  Hulk which is a bizarre creature with glaring eyes capable of confusing their
  foes, and large mandibles capable of slicing through rock. At this stage in
  their evolution, their body is vaguely humanoid allowing them to wear a
  helmet, an amulet, a cloak and even a pair of boots. However, once the Umber
  Hulk evolves it can no longer wear these items. Instead, it can use its four
  massive arms for weapons, shields, rings and gloves. At this stage, the Xorn
  can pass effortlessly through rock.
   
  Xorns are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. They have no active
  powers but instead rely on their ability to hide in rocks combined with their
  ability to attack with up to four weapons. They play like warriors and are
  strong as such.


***** <Angel>
--- Angel ---

  Angels are heavenly beings on a holy mission. They are winged creatures able
  to fly over chasms and pits. They also become resistant to the elements as
  they mature and are not fooled by invisibility. Their stats are truly
  awe-inspiring making them one of the most powerful monster races.
   
  Angels are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they rely on
  their divine powers which function like spells but need not be learned or
  cast from books. These powers can be used while blinded, but not while
  confused and they are also blocked by Anti-magic. The divine powers of the
  angel are quite powerful offering good offense combined with detection,
  healing and melee enhancement.  Wisdom is the primary spell stat.
   
  Angels use the same equipment slots as normal player races and have no innate
  attacks.


***** <Hound>
--- Hound ---

  While Hounds typically hunt in packs, you have chosen to go it alone. You
  will begin life in the weak form of a Clear Hound. As you mature you will
  take a number of evolutionary steps. At each such step, the form you evolve
  into will be randomly determined. But each tier offers more powerful choices
  than the last and who knows? You may even evolve into an Aether Hound some
  day.
   
  Hounds are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. They are not magical so
  cannot cast spells. However, they are fantastic hunters so learn a small
  number of abilities to aid in this endeavor. And of course, you are probably
  aware that hounds love to breathe!
   
  The body of the Hound is canine, so they cannot wield weapons. Instead, they
  attack with their vicious bite and razor sharp claws. They are not so
  powerful in melee as are dragons, but they are not that bad either. Hounds
  can wear four rings on their front paws, a pair of boots on their hind legs,
  an amulet around their neck and even a cloak and a suit of body armor.


***** <Giant>
--- Giant ---

  Giants are humanoids of immense stature. There are several types of giants.
  Fire, Frost and Storm giants are elemental giants and gain extra resistance,
  elementals slays and even elemental attacks of their respective element.
  Titans are powerful immortal beings of legend. Their attacks often confuse
  their foes and they rarely fight alone.
   
  Giants are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they must rely
  on their superior physical stature to pummel their opponents with mighty
  blows. Against a distant foe, giants are capable of hurling large boulders
  with devastating effect.
   
  Giants use the same equipment slots as normal player races and have no innate
  attacks.


***** <Beholder>
--- Beholder ---

  Beholders are floating orbs of flesh with a single central eye surrounded by
  numerous smaller eyestalks. They attack with their gaze which often confuses
  or even paralyzes their foes. They are unable to wield normal weapons or
  armor, but may equip a single ring on each of their eyestalks, and the number
  of eyestalks increases as the beholder evolves.
   
  Beholders are monsters so cannot choose a normal class. Instead, they gain
  powers as they evolve, including some limited offensive capabilities. But the
  beholders primary offense will always be their powerful gaze. Intelligence is
  the primary spell stat and beholders are quite intelligent indeed. Their
  searching and perception are legendary and they are quite capable with
  magical devices. However, they are not very strong and won't be able to stand
  long against multiple foes.


***** <Demon>
--- Demon ---

  Demons are powerful servants of evil. At the moment, the only subspecies of
  demon is the Balrog, but more will certainly be added in the future.
   
  Balrogs are powerful in melee and have access to a wide array of demonic
  spells of great power. Their devilish offense is unrivaled among all the
  monster races and at high levels they may unleash deadly hellfire upon their
  foes. Their summoning talents are also very good, but summoning a high demon
  requires a human sacrifice. Intelligence determines their casting abilities.
   
  Demons cannot eat normal food, but must feast upon the remains of their human
  enemies. Demons are unaffected by the Eldritch Horror and at high enough
  level, they become immune to the charge draining attacks of their enemies.


***** <Hydra>
--- Hydra ---

  Hydras are monsters with multiple heads. As they evolve, they grow additional
  heads granting the potential for extra attacks as well as the ability to wear
  more equipment (helmets and amulets). While not every head may wear a helmet
  and an amulet (This would be too powerful), each head is capable of
  attacking. So the 11-headed hydra can attack up to 11 times per round,
  provided it has enough strength and dexterity to command such a fearsome
  arsenal.
   
  Hydras are monsters so do not choose a normal class. Instead, they play much
  like warriors with a few limited abilities. All hydras regenerate quickly and
  5 and 7-headed hydras resist poison and gain a few poison based attacks. 9
  and 11-headed hydras are creatures of flame: Their attacks burn and they are
  capable of breathing fire among other flame based attacks. They resist fire
  as well.


***** <Leprechaun>
--- Leprechaun ---

  Leprechauns are small, mischevous creatures, always scheming for gold. They
  are weak, but quick and stealthy. For combat, they prefer not to use weapons
  at all. Rather, by keeping at least one hand free, they may pilfer objects or
  gold from their foes and flee to safety, all in a single action. However,
  they are capable of fighting with normal weapons should the need arise, but
  one seldom hears of leprechauns inspiring fear in combat!
   
  Leprechauns value riches above all else and even begin the game with their
  legendary pot of gold. Leprechauns also have the luck of the Irish, and good
  drops are more common for them. For magic, the leprechaun has a few talents
  and even a bit of cursing offense (Malicious and Death Leprechauns are vile,
  evil creatures, after all). They are masters of teleportation and detection.
  And while one never fears their combat (though one despises their thievery,
  of course), they are great masters of bow and device alike. At high levels,
  they move with incredible speed and seem to be in multiple places at once.
  Dexterity determines the leprechaun's skill with their magic.
   
  Leprechauns are monsters so can not choose a normal class. Instead, being
  small, they should spend their initial pot of gold wisely and then enter the
  dungeons in search of new treasure. Since gold is so important to the
  leprechaun, much of their strength depends on possessing a large hoard of
  wealth, and various leprechaun attributes are directly affected by the amount
  of gold on hand.

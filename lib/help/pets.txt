=== Pets and Companions === [Updated: PosBand 0.9.0]

Fighting with Morgoth's hordes alone is a very difficult task for an
adventurer. Fortunately, player can sometimes acquire friend monsters, which
will help him in his task. These friends are usually referred as "pets".
Your pet can actually be animal, humanoid, demon, undead, dragon, giant or
any other monster.


=== Acquiring pets ===

A pet can be acquired in a number of ways. The easiest is reading a Scroll
of Summon Pet; they are sold in the Temple, and cost about 750 gold pieces.
Scroll of Summon Pet creates from 1 to 3 pets adjacent to you. They are
generated on current dungeon level, so reading such scroll in town will
generate only townsmen!

Another ways include Wands of Charming (can be used to tame any non-unique
monster), Staves of Summon Pet (act like scrolls), race-specific powers (for
example, many necromantic races can summon undeads) and activating certain
artifacts. Last two ways may summon pets with more specific range of
possible races: only undead, only water elementals, only elemental dragons
etc.

Finally, player starts the game with one pet. See "Starting companion".


=== Pets vs. Companions ===

Normal pets can be commanded and summoned freely, but they are lost as soon
as player leaves dungeon level with them. It is possible to order your pet
to follow you between levels. Such pet is called a companion. You can
convert pet into a companion by pressing "y", choosing "Switch pet/companion
status", and targeting your pet.

Note, however, that, unlike pets, the number of your companions is limited,
and depends on your charisma stat. Even with very high CHA (>18/200) you can
have only 6 companions. Characters with very low CHA (7 or less) cannot have
even one companion.

As long as your pet is your companion, it will follow you even between
levels. No matter how far it was of you, when you go downstairs or upstairs
you will find your companion nearby, already arrived and ready for orders.
Companions also use Word of Recall spell effects to recall with you.
Companions behave exactly like usual pets in all other aspects.

You can turn your companion into a pet again with "y" menu whenever you
want.


=== Commanding pets ===

Usually, pets follow player closely in his adventures. If some hostile
monsters appear nearby, pet will attack it, in melee or using its spells or
abilities. When the enemy is dead (or out of range), pet will try to return
to player. This is usually enough, but in some situations you may decide
that you know better what to do. If this is the case, you should use "Give
target to pet" (or "Give target to all pets") option of "y" menu. If the
former is used, you must first target your pet, and then give it the target;
in the latter option, you have just to show target.

These commands have two forms:

 * When a (hostile) monster was targeted, pet(s) will try to get to it and
   attack. Pet(s) will fight to death, and will not choose another target
   for itself until target shown by you is dead, or the order is explicitly
   cancelled.

 * When a floor location is target, pet will try to get to it and then guard
   it. If hostile monster shown up, it will be attacked (by spells or innate
   abilities if it is far; in melee if it comes near), but in no case pet
   will ever leave its location, until the order is explicitly cancelled.

Note: pets can never directly cause any harm to player. Player is protected
from all effects of their spells and breathes.

You can also limit pets' arsenal of spells via "y" menu. The most useful
option is disabling their teleportation spells, which can be very annoying.
Other good option is turning off blind/confuse/scare/paralyze spells, which
are next to useless against high-level opponents. Actually, these two sets
of spells are disabled by default :-).


=== Experience and level-up ===

All monsters in PosBand have experience points and experience level, just
like player does. Experience is gained by killing other monsters. When a
monster gains a level, its hit points, armor class, melee damage, spell power
and mana are increased. Sometimes a monster can even evolve into a different
form - for example, Baby blue dragon grown into Young blue dragon.

Any monster can gain levels, but this is naturally most useful for
companions, since they are your long-term followers, and can earn quite a
lot experience. Regular pets and hostile monster can also gain some levels
in combat, but not a lot.

Note that killing a monster which has some experience will result in better
experience bonus for you (or for the monster who killed that monster).

When you "l"ook at monster, the game always tells you its experience level
(all monsters normally start with level 1). When "l"ooking at pets or
companions, the game can also tell you its exact statistics - hit points,
mana and so on.


=== Losing pets ===

When you think you don't need your pet anymore, you can choose to dismiss it
via "y" menu. You can also dismiss all pets (excluding companions) at once.
Dismissed pets vanish from the level instantly.

You can also turn your pet against yourself by attacking it. You cannot
attack it in melee, since moving into pet causes you to push past it
instead, but you can target it with missiles or spells (or simply something
thrown). Your pet will be enraged by each such attempt. When you try to
offend it fourth time, it will turn hostile. If you do not try to attack
your angry (but not hostile yet) pet anymore, it will eventually calm down.
Note that "angry" pets still perform all commands and fight for you; they
just are closer to ceasing doing that.


=== Starting companion ===

A player (of normal, non-monster races) starts the game with one companion.
Its type depends on race:

Race		Starting pet ---- evolves into ---- Last stage
=========================================================================
Human		Swordsman			    Berserker
Half-Elf	Baby blue dragon		    Great Storm Wyrm
Elf		Panther				    Displacer beast
Hobbit		Blink dog			    Hellhound
Gnome		Flesh golem			    Drolem
Dwarf		Dark hound			    Aether hound
Half-Orc	Dark elven mage			    Dark elven sorcerer
Half-Troll	Ogre				    Ogre chieftain
Dunadan		Illusionist			    Sorcerer
High-Elf	Pseudo-dragon			    Great Etherial Wyrm
Kobold		Giant tarantula			    Elder aranea


As you see, the companion will gain experience with player, and eventually
will grow into powerful forms. Note, however, that keeping your companion
alive and training him is a lengthy process, which can be pretty hard, but
the results will be rewarding.

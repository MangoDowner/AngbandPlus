GNOME
-------

Cousins of the dwarves, gnomes are weaker and even smaller 
than dwarves, but they make up for it by being intelligent and 
creative, and are known to be fine alchemists and inventors. 
Originally living in gnomish clans in the mountains with the 
dwarves, Gnomes have almost all migrated to the kingdom of 
Karingen, because this is where their skills are used the most.

Gnomes are intelligent, and also fairly tough, being cousins of the
dwarves. Their dexterity and agility, like dwarves, is pretty low, but
they make up for it by being very intelligent and good at casting
spells. They have also retained some skill in the art of Mining, though
they are no longer on par with dwarves.

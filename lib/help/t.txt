ZULGOR
--------

Zulgors are mysterious inviduals ressembling humans a lot.
They are said to be the cross between a human and a demon, but
others think they are a pure spawn of chaos. These invividuals
are recognised by their bicolor hairs, usually black and white,
red and purple or green and blue. And while they may looks
like simple humans, their feats tells otherwise. Their strength
and constitution are very high, and their intelligence is amazing.
They are also fast on feets, resist the effects of chaos and
are strangely attractive physically. Outclassing humans, these
spawns of chaos are unstable beings. Because of that, they
have to take extra time to master their own bodies, and that
means they take more time go gain experience than the regular
race, and they learn skills at a slower rate.

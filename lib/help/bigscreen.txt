====================== Using a Larger Display (Bigscreen) ======================

This version of Oangband supports Tom Morton's bigscreen patch, which
allows you to have a terminal larger than 80x24.  This allows you to
see more of the dungeon map.  The minimum terminal size is 80 columns
(x, width) by 24 rows (y, height).  The maximum size on a supported 
system is at least 200 columns (x) by 68 rows (y).

In Oangband, the Bigscreen patch does not provide any in game
advantages.  It is purely an interface improvement and is recommended.

To change the terminal size...

On MS Windows:
Change the NumCols and NumRows entries in the ANGBAND.INI file.
NumCols must be greater or equal to 80. NumRows must be greater or
equal to 24.

On a LINUX/UNIX system using x-windows:
Pass "-y<number of rows>" and "-x<number of cols>" options on the command 
line.  If that does not work, try also including "-mx11" on the command
line.  If that still does not work, Oangband has not been compiled with
proper support for the bigscreen patch.

On a LINUX/UNIX system using curses:
Pass "-y<number of rows>" and "-x<number of cols>" options on the command 
line.  If that does not work, try also including "-mgcu" on the command
line.  If that still does not work, Oangband has not been compiled with
proper support for the bigscreen patch.
Note: You must make sure that they curses screen you are using is of at
least the specified dimensions.

On DOS:
Pass "-y<number of rows>" and "-x<number of cols>" options on the command 
line.  If that does not work, try also including "-mibm" on the command
line.  If that still does not work, Oangband has not been compiled with
proper support for the bigscreen patch.

On other systems:
Bigscreen is not supported.

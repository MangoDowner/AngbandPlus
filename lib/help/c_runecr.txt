#####R=== Runecrafters ===

#####GDescription
Instead of using spellbooks like the other spellcasters they instead 
use mystic runes. To cast a spell they select a primary rune of the 
elements, fire, cold, etc. and they also chose a set of secondary runes,
which shape the effect of the first one. The secondary runes include 
Self, Arrow, Ray, ... and Armageddon. After that they chose the amount 
of mana to use and the spell is cast! But the more secondary runes they
chose the more mana is used to cast the spell. They also are bad 
fighters, but if they concentrate all their mana in one spell 
(especially with a mage staff of mana) they could kill nearly anything.

#####GPrimary Stats
Dexterity (spellcasting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
No other spellcaster can fine-tune magics quite like the Runecrafter, 
who combine runes that control magical type and effects, and then 
decides just how much effort the spell needs.  Runecrafters can invoke 
the most powerful magics of any class, but are always desperately hungry
for mana.  They can get more mana by increasing Dexterity (their spell 
stat), and by wielding special Mage Staffs.

Runecrafters combine runes using the 'm' command.  They first select a 
rune that controls magic type, then apply one or more runes to fine-tune
effects, (pressing ESC when done), and then input the amount of mana 
they wish to expend on the spell.

Runecrafters can cast the spells from their runes in several ways:
1. On-the-fly by combining runes when they need them.
2. Memorise rune combinations for quick use when needed (and they don't
   need to be able to see then!), and then later cast from memory.
3. Carving them into a runestone, then using the runestone later (takes
   less mana, but they have to be able to see).

=== General Information ===

This document gives a brief introduction to Frazband. You will probably
want to browse through all the "help files", especially the sections on
available commands (see command.txt [1] and commdesc.txt [2]), before
beginning any serious adventuring...


***** <Overview>
=== An Overview ===

The game of Frazband is a single player dungeon simulation. A player
may choose from a number of races, classes and magic skills when
creating a character (see charattr.txt [3]), and then "run" that
character over a period of days, weeks, even months. Deep down inside,
the real objective of the game is to increase your experience, and
certain other characteristics, and also to collect useful items, to
give you a decent chance against the great Morgoth, who lurks somewhere 
in the depths of the dungeon.

The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may
acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with
various shop owners. After preparing for his adventure, the player can
descend into the dungeon where fantastic adventures await his coming!


***** <Winning>
--- Winning The Game ---

Once your character has killed Sauron, who lives on level 99 (4950') in
the dungeon, a magical staircase will appear that will finally allow
you to reach level 100. Morgoth lurks on this level of his dungeon, and
you will not be able to go below his level until you have killed him.
Try to avoid wandering around on level 100 unless you are ready for him,
since it has a habit of coming at you across the dungeon, to slay you
for your impudence.

Morgoth cannot be killed by some of the easier methods used on normal
creatures. Morgoth, like all other "Unique" monsters, will simply
teleport away to another region of the level if you attempt to use a
spell such as destruction is upon it. Morgoth, like some other monsters,
cannot be polymorphed, slept, charmed, or genocided. Magical spells like
Mana Storm and Holy Orb are effective against him, as are some of the
more powerful weapons, but he is difficult to kill and if allowed to
escape for a time he will heal himself rapidly.

If you should actually survive the attempt of killing Morgoth, you will
receive the status of WINNER. You may continue to explore, and will even
find some *very* tough monsters at lower levels to try to kill, though
this gets quickly gets very difficult, (no matter how big and tough you
think you are, there's always someone bigger and tougher), but since you
have achieved your goal, you may want to retire. Unless you wish to
listen to the rumors of a powerful ring buried somewhere in the
dungeon...

When you are ready to retire, simply "commit suicide" ("^K") to have
your character entered into the high score list as a winner. Note that
until you retire, you can still be killed, so you may want to retire
before wandering into a hoard of Cyberdemons...


***** <UponDeath>
--- Upon Death and Dying ---

If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and cannot be
restored. A tombstone showing information about your character will be
displayed. You are also permitted to get a record of your character,
and all your equipment (identified) either on the screen or in a file.

Whether your character is killed or you retire victorious, it will
leave behind a reduced save file, which contains only the monster
memory (see attack.txt#MonsterMemory [4]) and your option choices. It
may be restored, in which case the new character is generated exactly
as if the file was not there, but the new player will find his monster
memory containing all the experience of past incarnations.

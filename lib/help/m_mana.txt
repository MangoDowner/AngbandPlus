#####R === ToME Magic - Mana School ===

The mana school of magic contains spells where the raw force of magic is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of Magical 
Energy" which contains all the mana school spells within it's bindings.

Worshipping the God Eru Iluvatar also gives the ability to cast spells from
the mana school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. e.g. If the skill 
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 5 mana school
spells.

#####GMana Spells
The are four spells available for the mana school. These Spells are:
1. [[[[[BManathrust] (school level 1)

=== Creating a Character ===

STangband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
character in the world of STangband. Perhaps the most important thing
you control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or
allow to be chosen various attributes that will affect the future life
of your character.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of
choices as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play,
followed by a series of random calculations to generate ("roll up") a
random character matching the appropriate constraints.

Once your character has been generated, you will be given the choice to
generate a new character obeying the same constraints, and once you
have generated more than one character, you can switch back and forth
between the two most recent characters, until you are presented with a
character that you feel comfortable with.

You may start the entire process over at any time by pressing 'ESC' at
any prompt (with the exception of the autoroller (see below [1]) prompt
and the prompt for the number of random quests (see below [2])).  Also,
on the final screen, use delete or backspace to restart.

***** <BirthOptions>
=== Birth Options ===

During character generation you may press '=' at any time to access
the options screen. A more detailed description of the various options
can be found in the section on the Options Page (see option.txt [3]).
Here you may set yout 'Birth options' which are options set at birth
and which cannot be changed again during the game. Note that you may
change your birth option preferences in game but these will only have
effect in your next character. Perhaps one of the most important
features of the birth options is the ability to decide what type of
town level you want. The various town options are discussed on the Town
page (see town.txt#TownLevel [4]). Another important decision to make
is whether you wish to use the Autoroller (see below [1]) or the point-
based character generation system (see below [d]).


***** <CharAttributes>
=== Character Attributes ===

Once you begin character generation you will be asked to choose
your character's three primary attributes - its sex, race and
class. If you have selected a spellcasting class, you will also be
prompted for your choice of magic realm(s).

Your character's sex has a minimal effect on game play - females start
with slightly more gold, males are generally heavier and so can bash
more effectively. Race, class and magic realms have a far more
significant effect and are discussed at some length in the Race (see
charattr.txt#TheRaces [5]), Class (see charattr.txt#TheClasses [6])
and Magic Realms (see magic.txt#MagicRealms [7]) sections.

--- Secondary Attributes ---

Each character has a few secondary attributes, height, weight, social
class, and background history, which are randomly determined, but which
are affected by the sex and race of the character. In general, these
attributes are only used to provide "flavor" to the character, to
assist in the roll playing, but they do have a few minor effects on the
game. For example, background history affects social class, which
affects the amount of money the character will start with. And weight
affects carrying capacity and bashing ability.

***** <RaceClassComb> 
=== Race/Class Combinations ===

Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. Some 
race/class combinations are not recommended and so certain classes are
shown inside brackets. This may be because the combination is not
conceptually sound or because the chosen race has stat penalties in
areas where that class needs bonuses.

However, any race/class combination can be chosen and experienced
players may often choose unusual combinations for the challenge that
they represent. It is recommended that inexperienced players choose
warriors as spellcasting requires a player more familiar with dungeon
survival techniques.

There was a table here but it became *very* large and was not really
necessary since the bracket are quite clear.


***** <ChoosingMagic>
=== Choosing Your Magic Realm(s) ===

If you have selected a spellcasting class, you will next be prompted
for your choice of magic realm(s). The magic system, as implemented in
Zangband, consists of seven realms: Life, Arcane, Sorcery, Nature,
Trump, Chaos and Death. 

In STangband the realms are Fire, Water. Earth, Air, Life, Death, 
Order, Chaos, Astral and Wizardy. Life is a combination of Zangband 
Life and Nature spells, Astral is a modified Arcane, Order is a 
modified Sorcery, Chaos is a combination of Chaos and Trump, 
Death is almost the same.

A more complete description of the magic
realms and spellcasting in general can be found in the section on the
Magic Realms (see magic.txt#MagicRealms [7]).

All spell books now have a fair amount of Attack, Defence and Utility
spells. High Mage is not recomended because all attack spells are based 
around one or two damage types. So you may discover you cannot damage 
a creature because it has resistance. High Mage may be removed or 
modified later. If you pick the realms always in the same
order (e.g. nature as your first realm and chaos as your second realm,
not the other way around) you will be less confused when trying to
pick the correct spellbook to use in the game.

***** <Restrictions>
--- Class/Realm Restrictions ---

In STangband, spellcasting classes can select only one realm
from those available. If the class uses two realms the first will be
chosen from what class they choose. All classes which can learn two 
realms will learn their first realm 'better' than their second.

Note that certain realms may be prohibited for some classes. This is
to stop players using opposing realms like Fire and Water. Also the
Tech/Caster classes have restriction to ensure correctness.

The table below shows the realm choices of all casters. 1st means 
that this is their fixed realm and a 2nd means they may chose it.

***** <RandomQuests>
=== RandomQuests ===

Once you have chosen your race, class and (if applicable) your magic
realm(s), you will be asked how many random quests you wish to be
assigned. You may choose any number between 0 and 49. A more detailed
discussion of random quests can be found in the Dungeon section (see
dungeon.txt#RandomQuests [8]).


***** <AutoRoller>
=== The Auto-Roller ===

The auto-roller is a quick means of generating start-up characters
based on a set of user-selected criteria. If you choose to use the
auto-roller, you will be presented with a column giving the maximum
possible statistics (see charattr.txt#PrimaryStats [9]) for your choice
of race, class and maximize mode (see option.txt#StartUp [3]). You will
then be prompted to enter your desired statistics which should not
exceed the maximum statistics displayed on the screen.

Once you have entered your desired statistics, the computer will then
randomly roll successive start-up characters and compare them to your
specified criteria. Each stat is rolled as a number from 8 to 17, with
a normal distribution, and is then immediately modified based upon the
race and class which you have chosen. The exact quantum of this
modification can be found in the Character Attributes section (see
charattr.txt#StatBonusTable [a]).

***** <CharDisplay>
Once a character that matches or exceeds your expectations has been
rolled, the computer will display the character for you to look at and
also display the character's life-rating (see below [b]). If you accept
the rolled character (by pressing 'Enter'), you will be asked for its
name (see below [c]). If not, you may press 'r' to resume rolling and
searching for the next match or, if this is not your first match, 'p'
to return to the previous character which met your criteria.

Note: The statistics are not independent of each other and trying to
maximize each one using the auto-roller will not work. A good idea is
to specify statistics close to maximum that are critical for your class
(for example, high wisdom for priests, intelligence for mages and
strength and dexterity for warriors). You should set minimum acceptable
levels for the remaining statistics rather than looking for high rolls.

If you select not to use the auto-roller, the computer will roll one
random character at a time and then display it for you to either accept
or reject. The 'r', 'p' and 'Enter' keys will work as outlined above.


***** <PointBased>
=== Point-based Character Generation ===
This alternative method of determining your starting statistics gives
you 48 'points' which may be 'spent' on increasing your statistics
according to your own preference.  Using this system you are better
able to customize your character but may not get such high individual
statistics as are possible with th auto-roller. Note that as your stats
get higher it takes more points to increase them further. Also note
that should you choose not to spend all your points, you will be given
100 gold pieces for each unused point subject to an upper limit of 600
gold pieces.


***** <LifeRating>
=== Life Ratings ===

During the course of 'rolling' your character you will be told its life
rating. This is an indication of how many hitpoints your character will
have at character level 50 before taking into consideration any bonus
from having a high constitution. The life rating will be displayed in
the form of x/100 where 'x' is typically a number varying between 80
and 120.

Example 1, a human mage has a 10-sided hit dice yielding an average of
5.5 hitpoints per level for an average maximum hitpoints at level 50
of 50*5.5=275. If this mage had a life-rating of 110/100, then at level
50, he would have 275*(110/100)=302 hitpoints (before considering any
bonuses from constitution).

Example 2, a human warrior has a 19-sided hit dice yielding an average
of 10 hitpoints per level for an average maximum hitpoints at level 50
of 50*10=500. If this warrior had a life-rating of 95/100, then at
level 50, he would have 500*(95/100)=475 hitpoints (before considering
any bonuses from constitution).

Your life rating is only a guarantee of your character's base hitpoints
at level 50. This might be achieved by small increases in the early
stages and much larger increases in the later game or the other way
around. Generally, however, the increases tend to be fairly even.


***** <CharName>
=== Naming Your Character ===

Once you have accepted a character you will be asked to provide a name
for the character. In general, the actual choice of a name is not
important, but do keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game
itself. For example, on some machines, the character name determines
the filename that will be used to save the character to disk. On
others, the character name specifies special "pref" files. And the
character name is used on the high score list.


***** <StartInventory>
=== Starting Inventory ===

Once you have named your character, you will be prompted to press 'Enter'
and, having done so, you will be brought to the town screen from where
you will begin your adventuring. You should note that each character
starts in the town with a small number of items in their inventory.
Which items you are given will depend upon your chosen race and class
and the number of such items depends on chance. For example, all
classes receive either food rations or scrolls of satisfy hunger but
the number of rations or scrolls received is random. Typically, you
will receive a weapon, a piece of armor, some food, some torches and
a magical item although there is some variance from this.

=== Creating a Character ===

PosChengband is a role playing game, in which you, the player, control a
character in a dangerous world of myth and magic. The most imporatant
decision you make on your quest to the Kill the Serpent of Chaos is
what kind of character to play: Spell-wielding magician or sword-waving
warrior? Stealthy rogue or muscial bard? Holy priest or evil spawn of
chaos? The choices are myriad and the process of generating a new
character is described in this help file.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of
choices. You must choose your character's race (Human, Elf, Hobbit,
Orc, Undead, Demon, etc), your character's class (Warrior, Mage, 
Priest, Rogue, etc) and you character's personality (Mighty, Shrewd, 
Patient, etc). Each of these choices are described in the help
files.

You may start the entire process over at any time by pressing 'S' at
any prompt.


***** <CharAttributes>
=== Character Attributes ===

Once you begin character generation you will be asked to choose your
character's four primary attributes - its sex, race, class and
personality.  If you have selected a spellcasting class, you will also
be prompted for your choice of magic realm(s).  Your character's sex
has a minimal effect on game play, but some personalities are
restricted to male only or female only.  More details of attributes
are found in the Races, Classes and Personalities section (see [a]) 
and the Magic System section (see [b]).

In addition to these attributes, there are several statistics which
are used to determine your character's relative skills and abilities
as follows:


--- Primary Statistics ---

Each character has six primary statistics or 'stats'.  These are
strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma,
which modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways.  For
example, strength affects your carrying capacity, the amount of damage
you do to a monster when you hit it and the number of blows per round 
you get with a weapon. A more complete discussion of the primary
statistics is contained later in this document (see below [c]).

--- Experience ---

Experience affects almost everything else about your character.
Experience can be gained as your character kills monsters, casts
spells for the first time, learns about an object kind by using it, 
disarms traps and unlocks doors.  Certain classes may also gain 
experience by destroying specific dungeon spell books and there
are potions in the dungeon that will boost your experience if you
quaff them.

When your character's experience crosses certain fixed boundaries, you
will attain a new experience level (up to a maximum of 50).  When this
happens, your hitpoints, mana (if any), certain skills such as melee
fighting and bows and throws will all increase.  Some races and
classes will also gain new powers and abilities when crossing certain
experience thresholds.

Deep down inside, the real objective of the game is to increase your
experience, and certain other characteristics, and also to collect
useful items, to give you a decent chance against the great Serpent of
Chaos.  Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus your
level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher
level.  Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical
means, or by simply regaining the experience all over again.

--- Gold (AU) ---

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items and
services from the shops and other buildings on the town level.  Gold
can be obtained by selling items to the shops, taking it from the
corpses of dead monsters, mining it and by finding it lying on the
dungeon floor.

Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is random.
Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which may be kept, 
or sold to a shop-keeper for more gold.

--- Hit Points ---

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before he dies.  Your hit points are derived
from your race, class, level, and constitution, and can be boosted by
magical means.  Hit points may be regained by resting, or by a variety
of magical means.

--- Spell Points (Mana) ---

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many
spells a character can cast.  Your spell points (sometimes called
mana) are derived from your class, level, a primary stat of your
class, and race modifier of that stat.  Spell points may be regained
by resting, or by a few magical means.

--- Character Skills ---

Each character also has several primary skills: disarming, magic
devices, saving throws, stealth, searching, perception, melee and bows
and throws, which are derived from the character's race, class,
experience level, stats and their current equipment.  These skills
have fairly obvious effects, but will be described more completely
below.  The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and
class.  Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may
increase with the level of the character (see below for details [d]).


***** <BirthOptions>
=== Birth Options ===

During character generation you may press '=' at any time to access
the birth options.  A more detailed description of the various birth
options can be found in the section on the Options Page (see [e]).  
Some options have "(*)" mark that means these options effect to the 
difficulty of the game and effect to estimation of your score.

Perhaps one of the most important features of the birth options is the
ability to decide what type of town level you want.  The various town
options are discussed on the Town page (see [f]).


***** <AutoRoller>
=== The Auto-Roller ===

The auto-roller is a quick means of generating start-up characters
based on a set of user-selected criteria.  If you choose to use the
auto-roller, you will be presented with a column giving the maximum
possible statistics (see below [c]) for your choice of race, class and
personality (see [a]).  Then you can specify your desired statistics 
using keypad or cursor keys.

Once you have specified your desired statistics, the computer will
then randomly roll successive start-up characters and compare them to
your specified criteria.  Each stat is rolled as a number from 8 to
17, with a normal distribution, and is then immediately modified based
upon the race, class and personality which you have chosen.  The exact
quantum of this modification can be found in the stat bonus table (see
[h], [i] and [j]).

Once a character that matches or exceeds your expectations has been
rolled, PosChengband stops to ask you whether you accept or not.  If you
accept the rolled character (by pressing Enter), you will be asked for
its name.  If not, you may press 'r' to resume rolling and searching
for the next match or, if this is not your first match, 'p' to return
to the previous character which met your criteria.

Note: The statistics are not independent of each other and trying to
maximize each one using the auto-roller will not work.  A good idea is
to specify statistics close to maximum that are critical for your
class (for example, high wisdom for priests, intelligence for mages
and strength and dexterity for warriors).  You should set minimum
acceptable levels for the remaining statistics rather than looking for
high rolls. Also note that PosChengband significantly "nerfs" the power
of the Auto-roller relative to other variants such as Hengband. After
50,000 rolls the Auto-roller simply stops and forces you to accept the
best match (if any) or to repick minimums. In general, you can pick 2 
stats to be maximal but no more.

If you select not to use the auto-roller, the computer will roll one
random character at a time and then display it for you to either
accept or reject.  The 'r', 'p' and Enter keys will work as outlined
above. Since PosChengband is a difficult game, we recommend using the
auto-roller.


***** <BackgroundEditor>
=== Background Edit-Mode ===

The computer will randomly generate background information text of the
character for you.  But you can modify or rewrite it after rolling up
the character in Background edit-mode.  Use key-pad or cursor keys to
move cursor, the Enter key to finish edit-mode, and the Escape key to
finish edit-mode with discarding changes. Use Ctrl-A key to load the
background information text from "histpref-<<playername>>.prf" or
"histpref.prf" on lib/user.

You can use conditional expressions like other pref files. Background
information text can be modified in background information pref files
as lines of the form "H:<str>".


***** <QuickStart>
=== Quick Start ===

Once an existing character dies you may create a new one from the same
savefile. If so, you will be asked whether you want to use quick start 
or not at start up.  If you choose to use quick start, you get new 
character with exactly same race, class, stat, background and etc. as 
your last character. Since it is common to die early on, this option
can save you the tedium of re-rolling a new character from scratch.


***** <PrimaryStats>
=== Primary Statistics ===

Each character has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the
abilities of the character in a variety of ways.  Every stat has a
numerical value, ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum
of 18, and even higher, into the "percentile" range, represented as
"18/01" through "18/120".  The true maximum of each base stat is 
randomly chosen from 18/80 to 18/120, and average of all your stat 
maximums are always 18/100. These maximums are chosen randomly when your
character is created or your character quaffs a Potion of New Life.
Actually, every stat can be raised even above these maximum of base
stat by modification from race, class, personality and magical
equipment, up to a pure maximum of 18/220, which is represented as
"18/***".

Traditionally, a percentile stat such as "18/50" has been thought of as
representing a value part way between 18 and 19, and this is one way to
think of them.  However, often, the best way to view the "bonus" values
after the "18/" is as "tenth" points, since it often takes the same
magic to raise a stat from, say, 4 to 5, or 16 to 17, as it does from,
say, 18/40 to 18/50.  The important thing to remember is that almost all
internal calculations "ignore" the final digit of any "bonus", so that,
for example, "18/40" and "18/49" always have the same effects.

--- The Primary Statistics ---

Strength
     Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee combat and
     with missile weapons.  A high strength will improve your chances
     of getting multiple blows with your melee weapon and, in
     addition, will dramatically increase the amount of damage done
     with each hit.  Strength also has a marginal effect on your
     chance to hit your opponent.  Characters with low strength may
     receive penalties.  Strength is also useful in tunneling, bashing
     and in carrying heavy items without being slowed down.
 
Intelligence
     Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like
     spellcasters (high mages, mages, warrior-mages, chaos-warriors 
     and rogues).  Intelligence will affect the number of spells 
     these classes may learn each level, the number of spell points 
     they receive and their spell fail rates.  These classes cannot 
     learn spells if their intelligence is 7 or lower.  Also, intelligent 
     characters are better at using magic devices, picking locks and 
     disarming traps. Finally, intelligence influences how quickly all
     characters learn from their experiences.

 
Wisdom
     Wisdom affects the ability of priest-like spellcasters (priests,
     paladins and monks) to use prayers.  WIS will affect the number
     of spells these classes may learn each level, the number of spell
     points they receive and their spell fail rates.  In addition, WIS
     is also used to determine a Mindcrafter's ability to use his or
     her mental powers.  These classes cannot learn spells if their
     wisdom is 7 or lower.  Wise character's will have better chances
     of resisting magical spells cast upon them by monsters. Wisdom
     also affects the players awareness of their surroundings, granting
     faster or slower pseudo-id and level feelings.
 
Dexterity
     Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
     dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
     lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and will
     increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows
     from enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in picking locks,
     disarming traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves
     that inhabit the dungeons.
 
Constitution
     Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
     body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a character
     with a high constitution will receive more hit points and also
     recover them faster while resting.

Charisma
     Charisma represents a character's personality and force of will.
     A character with a high charisma will be better able to dominate
     foes as pets. Also, charisma is the primary stat used for 
     determining player and monster fear. A low charisma player is
     often frightened, sometimes even to the point of paralysis! A
     high charisma player can more easily break the morale of their
     foes. In PosChengband, Fear is a very important and deadly component
     of gameplay. As such, charisma is a very important stat. Finally,
     some classes (Bards, Sorcerers, etc) use Charisma as their primary
     spell stat.


***** <PrimarySkills>
=== Primary Skills ===

Characters possess some different abilities which can help them to
survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based upon race
and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may
increase with the level of the character with the rate of increase
dependent upon the level of the character.
 
Melee
     Melee is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
     Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but if
     his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive more
     blows per round with lighter weapons.  Strength and dexterity
     both modify the ability to hit an opponent.  This skill increases
     with the level of the character.
 
Bows and Throws
     Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in
     this skill.  Different stats apply to different weapons, but this
     ability may modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the
     amount of damage done, and the ability to hit a creature.  This
     skill increases with the level of the character.
 
Saving Throws
     A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the
     effects of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.  This
     does not include spells cast on the player by his own stupidity,
     such as quaffing a nasty potion.  This ability increases with the
     level of the character, but then most high level creatures are
     better at casting spells, so it tends to even out.  A high wisdom
     also increases this ability.
 
Stealth
     The ability to move silently about is very useful.  Characters
     with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining
     the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy
     character entirely, allowing a player to avoid certain fights.
     This skill is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
     improve unless magically enhanced.
 
Disarming
     Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and includes
     picking locks on traps and doors.  A successful disarming will
     gain the character some experience.  A trap must be found before
     it can be disarmed.  Dexterity and intelligence both modify the
     ability to disarm, and this ability increases with the level of
     the character.
 
Magical Devices
     Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires
     experience and knowledge.  Spell users such as magi and priests
     are therefore much better at using a magical device than say a
     warrior.  This skill is modified by intelligence, and increases
     with the level of the character.
 
Perception (Searching Frequency)
     Perception is the ability to notice something without actively
     seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon race and
     class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
Searching (Searching Ability)
     To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps, and
     traps on chests.  Rogues are the best at searching, but magi,
     rangers, and priests are also good at it.  This skill is based
     entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless
     magically enhanced.

Infra-vision
     Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources.  Since most of
     the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the
     player to see walls and objects.  Infra-vision will allow a
     character to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain
     distance.  This ability works equally well with or with out a
     light source.  The majority of PosChengband's creatures are
     cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light
     source.  Most non-human races have innate infra-vision ability.
     Humans can gain infra-vision only if it is magically enhanced.


***** <Proficiency>
=== Proficiency Levels ===

In PosChengband, characters possess different proficiency levels or
experiences for each weapon type, spells, and a few other skills.  The
starting proficiency levels and the maximum proficiency levels of a
character are based upon class.  Each proficiency level may increase
when you practice with it, and can be checked by the 'Check various
information' command (~).

For weapon proficiency, you need to hit monsters many times with a
weapon of that type to practice.  And your to-hit bonus of the weapon
will increases with the proficiency level of it. The rate of increase
is dependent upon the level of the character and the level of the
opponents.

For spell proficiency, you need to cast the spell many times in a deep
level of the dungeon to practice. However, simply casting the spell
repeatedly for no purpose other than gaining experience will not work.
Rather, the game detects this "spamming" so you really should practice
spells out in the real world, not sequestered in some safe corner
of the dungeon.  Finally, the fail-rate and mana consumption rate 
of the spell decreases when the proficiency level increases.

The effect of the proficiency level of the Dual Wielding and the
Martial Arts is almost same as the weapon proficiency; These will
effect upon your to-hit bonus of dual wielding combat or bare handed
combat.

For the proficiency level of the Riding, you need to attack in melee
or shoot with missile weapon when riding.  And your speed increases up
to the mount's speed when the proficiency level increases.  (see [k])

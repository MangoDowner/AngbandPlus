=== Creating a Character ===

When you create a character, you can choose their sex, race and name 
and roll their starting stats. 

In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself.  For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk.  On others, the character name specifies
special "pref" files.  And the character name is used on the high score list.


=== Character Characteristics ===

Each character has two primary attributes, sex and race, that
are chosen before the character is generated, and which will stay fixed
for the entire life of that character.  These attributes have many effects,
which will be mentioned as they come up.  Character gender does not have
any significant gameplay effects.

Each character has a few secondary attributes, height, weight, social class,
and background history, which are randomly determined, but which are affected
by the sex and race of the character.  In general, these attributes are only
used to provide "flavor" to the character, to assist in the role playing, but
they do have a few minor effects on the game.  

Each character also has nine primary "stats", strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, agility, stealth, perception and luck, which modify 
the abilities of the character in a variety of ways.  Every stat has a 
numerical value, ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, 
and even higher, into the "percentile" range, represented as "18/01" through 
"18/200"

Each character also has several primary "skills", disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, searching frequency, fighting skill,
and shooting skill, which are derived from the character's race, level,
stats, and current equipment.  

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based on
the race of the character.  These may include special resistances, or even
abilities such as infravision.

Each character has experience, which increases as the character adventures, 
and a level, which is based on experience. In Ironband, you can only get up 
to L36 (as opposed to L50 in other *bands). 

In Ironband, if you pick up treasure (money and gems), you gain experience.
Once you reach a higher level, some low-grade money (like copper) will no
longer yield experience. 

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character can
avoid damage.  The armor class is affected by dexterity and equipment

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the character can
sustain before he dies.  How many hit points a character has is determined by
race, level and constitution.

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many spells
(or prayers) a character can cast (or pray).  The maximum number of spell
points is derived from your level and Wisdom.


=== Races ===

     There are eight different races that you may choose among.
Races differ in vital statistics, and tend to be better at some abilities than
at others.

     In Ironband, you gain stat points when you go down levels. You'll find 
that these stat points will tend to go on the stats most suited to your race
(especially below DL 7).
 
Human:
     A flexible and adaptive race, humans are found all over Middle-Earth, from
desert Harad to icy Horodwaith.  They have no special adjustments to stats, and
no special strengths or weaknesses.  

Half-Elf:
     The descendants of Elves and Humans, Half-elves are better at magic than 
humans, more dextrous, stealthier and have longer sight, but are not so strong 
or tough. Half-elves sustain dexterity inherently, and are native to forest.

Hobbit:
     Hobbits are shy, retiring folk with enough good sense to share.  They live
in homes with circular entranceways built partially underground, and are the
smallest of all the races.  They are weak, have few hit points, are slow movers 
and are very poor at melee. But many of their other abilities are excellent. As 
well as having good skills, Hobbits are stealthy, lucky, and dextrous. They are 
also resistant to experience draining and loss of constitution.

Gnome:
     Gnomes are the pudgy pranksters of the dungeon; if they can kill something
in a humorous way, so much the better.  They may be small and ugly, but can
outbargain and outwit just about anyone.  They are among the frailer races, and
not powerful in combat, but are very good at magic, are stealthy and have good 
eyesight. They have innate infravision, and -- most importantly -- are immune to
paralyzation.

Dwarf:
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  They are strong,
and tough, but not very good at casting spells. They are slow moving but have
good vision and are good at finding treasure. Dwarves are quite good at melee
combat, have innate infravision, and -- a major advantage -- can never be
blinded.  They do have one big drawback, though:  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason,
screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a
miserable stealth.

Half-Orc:
     The bastard offspring of humans and orcs, half-orcs are ugly, strong, and
have very bad attitudes.  Their magic is poor, as are most of their skills, but 
they know how to fight and can take as much damage as they dish out. They are
sneaky, but have poor eyesight. On the other hand, half-orcs have innate 
infravision and, like orcs themselves, resist darkness and its effects.

Half-Troll:
     Half-trolls are built like blocks of granite; no other race can match their
strength or recover hitpoints as quickly.  Their hand-to-hand combat prowess is
fearsome and they are amazingly tough.  Unfortunately, they do poorly at almost
everything else. They are very bad at magic, are very noisy, have bad eyesight
and are often klutzes. At least they have innate infravision and always have 
their strength sustained.  

High-Elf:
      High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard and answered
the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, before the sun and moon
were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm for long ages before returning to
mortal lands. They are generally superior in stats, except for slightly poor
strength and hardiness. No other race is as good at magic, and none is so skilled 
with missile weapons.  High-elves are able to see the unseen, have good 
infravision, and have innate resistance to light. They are also native to forest. 
However, having lived so long and learnt so much, it is very hard for them to 
advance further.  


====== Classes ======

     There are no character classes in Ironband. Every character can potentially
fight, sneak and cast spells.


=== Stats ===

          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting in melee. A high strength
               increases your damage and allows you to use heavy weapons without
               penalty. If your weapon is too heavy for your strength, you
               will get less attacks and have to-hit penalties.
               Strength is also useful in tunneling and in carrying heavy items.
 
          Intelligence
               Intelligence affects your ability to cast spells. The higher
               your Intelligence, the less the chance that your spells will fail.
               Intelligence also affects your ability to disarm traps and to
               use some magic devices, and is protective against confusion.
               If your Intelligence is really low you may have trouble reading scrolls.
 
          Wisdom
               Wisdom increases the amount of SP (mana) you have.
               As if that wasn't enough, it also improves your saving throw
               which protects you from various magical attacks.
 
          Dexterity
               Dexterity is skill with your hands. High dexterity increases
               your melee attacks per round, and your missile shot speed as 
               well if it is high enough. It also improves your chance of 
               hitting in melee.  Dexterity is useful in picking locks and 
               disarming traps.
 
          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
               body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
               character with a high constitution will receive more hit
               points and also recover them faster while resting. Very high
               Constitution also allows the character to eat less.
 
          Agility
               Agility is your speed of movement. It can give you a +Speed
               bonus (allowing you to attack, shoot and move more often). It
               also affects your AC. A very agile character recovers faster
               from paralysis and is better protected from some of the 
               thieves that inhabit the dungeons.
               
          Stealth
               Stealth allows you to sneak around the dungeon without being
               noticed and attacked by monsters. Picking your fights is a big
               advantage. Also, if you sneak up to a monster and attack it in
               melee, you will get a combat bonus - the more stealthy you are,
               the bigger the bonus. And at high Stealth levels you gain resistance 
               to darkness attacks.
               Stealth is reduced by heavy body armour or big clunky boots.
               
          Perception
               Perception has many advantages. Characters with high perception
               have 'eagle eyes' and get bonuses to hit and damage with missile
               weapons. They have a chance of spotting and avoiding traps. They
               are better at searching, and get information on the magic bonuses
               of items they pick up more quickly. At high levels of perception
               you can get infravision, increased light radius, and even a limited
               form of ESP which indicates your ability to hear and smell nearby 
               monsters. Perception can also help you recover from blindness quicker.
               Perception is reduced by the heavier helmets.
               
          Luck
               Luck governs your chances of finding good items. With high luck,
               you will find more useful equipment - and more artifacts, especially
               if your luck is extremely high. With low luck you will stumble on
               more junk and cursed items. Being lucky can also sometimes save you
               from an early death (when a monster hits you with an attack that should
               normally insta-kill you).

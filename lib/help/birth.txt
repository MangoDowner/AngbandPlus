=== Creating a Character ===

Angband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a character
in the world of Angband.  Perhaps the most important thing you control is the
birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be chosen various
attributes that will affect the future life of your character.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices
as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play, followed by
a series of random calculations to generate ("roll up") a random character
matching the appropriate constraints.

Once your character has been generated, you will be given the choice to
generate a new character obeying the same constraints, and once you have
generated more than one character, you can switch back and forth between
the two most recent characters, until you are presented with a personality
that you feel comfortable with.

You may start the entire process over at any time.

Once you have accepted a character you will asked to provide a name for the
character.  In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself.  For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk.  On others, the character name specifies
special "pref" files.  And the character name is used on the high score list.


=== Character Characteristics ===

Each character has three primary attributes, sex, race, and class, that
are chosen before the character is generated, and which will stay fixed
for the entire life of that character.  These attributes have many effects,
which will be mentioned as they come up.

Each character has a few secondary attributes, height, weight, social class,
and background history, which are randomly determined, but which are affected
by the sex and race of the character.  In general, these attributes are only
used to provide "flavor" to the character, to assist in the role playing, but
they do have a few minor effects on the game.  For example, background history
affects social class, which affects the starting money. (Not a lot, in the case
of some races: for instance, Half-Trolls are always going to be the scum of 
society, even if their father was the Clan Chief.) 

Each character also has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the abilities of the
character in a variety of ways.  Every stat has a numerical value, ranging
from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even higher, into
the "percentile" range, represented as "18/01" through "18/100": this is the
maximum that can be achieved intrinsically, for any given stat. If the 
character is started with the option of "maximize effect of race/class 
bonuses" (from the Birth Options menu, and this is set as "on" by default), 
the maximum figure of 18/100 is further adjusted by the adjustments for 
race and class - for instance, a Half-Troll Warrior will max out at 18/190 
strength, but only 18/40 intelligence, whereas a Hobbit Mage will be able 
to reach 18/150 intelligence but only 18/30 strength. Equipment may add 
bonuses or penalties to this, and raise the player's stats beyond the normal
intrinsic limits: the stats may go as high as they like, with the right choice
of equipment, but the effects of having higher stats largely stop at 18/200.

Each character also has several primary "skills", disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, searching frequency, alertness,
fighting skill,and shooting skill, which are derived from the character's race,
class, level, stats, and current equipment.  These skills have rather obvious
effects, but will be described more completely below.

Each character may have one or more "racially intrinsic skills", based on
the race of the character.  These may include special resistances, or even
abilities such as darkvision.

Each character has experience, which increases as the character becomes more
experienced, and a level, which is based on experience, and also on race and
class.  As the experience rises, so does the level, and as the level rises,
certain other abilities and characteristics rise as well.  Deep down inside,
the real objective of the game is to increase your experience, and certain
other characteristics, and also to collect useful items, to give you a decent
chance against Morgoth.  Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and
thus your level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher
level.  Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical means, or
by simply regaining the experience all over again.

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it hidden in
the dungeon.  Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which
is based on the characters social class (higher is better), charisma (higher
is better), and other stats (less powerful characters start with more gold).  
Each character also starts out with a few useful items, which may be kept, 
or sold to a shop-keeper for more gold. However, especially valuable items
will never sell for the full price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum that 
he is prepared to pay for any item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy 
your items for up to 30,000 gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and 
will pay no more than 5,000.

Note that, by default, you will not be able to sell things to shops. You can 
change the birth option before the game starts to be able to sell to shops, but
it is not recommended.  Gold drops in the dungeon are bigger with selling to
shops turned off, and having it turned off also keeps you from gathering junk
you will never use to take back and sell and makes you focus on the point of
the game: killing monsters, gaining experience and equipment, and becoming 
powerful enough to kill Morgoth.

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character can
avoid damage.  The armor class is affected by dexterity and the equipment. 
Armor class on equipment is always denoted in [square brackets], usually as 
a figure of [X,+Y] where X is the intrinsic AC of the armor in question, and 
Y is the magical bonus to armor class provided by that item.

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the character can
sustain before he dies.  How many hit points a character has is determined by
race, class, level and constitution, as follows:  each race has a basic "hit
dice" number - for instance, a Dwarf's basic hit die is 11, while a hobbit's is 
7. This is modified by class: for instance, a warrior gets a +9 bonus to the 
hit die, while a mage gets no bonus and a priest +2, so a dwarven warrior's 
total hit die will be (11+9)=20 - meaning that he gets between 1 and 20 hit 
points per level. If he were a priest, his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get
between 1 and 13 hit points per level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-7 hps
per level. (All characters get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is 
a random roll of 1dX where X is the hit die number, when the character goes up
in level.) This is further modified by constitution - a character with high 
constitution will get a flat bonus of a certain number of hit points per level
(recalculated right back to level 1: if you gain an extra hit point per level, 
and you are 42nd level, you will suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many spells
(or prayers) a character can cast (or pray).  The maximum number of spell
points is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or
wisdom (for prayers), and you can never have more spell points than the
maximum.  Spell points may be regained by resting, or by magical means.
Warriors never have any spell points.  If a character gains enough wisdom or
intelligence to get more spell points, the result is calculated right back to
first level, just as with constitution and hit points.


=== Races ===

There are seventeen different races that you can choose from in DaJAngband,
plus one novelty race which has its own required class.  Some races are
restricted as to what profession they may be, and each race has its own
adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. Most races also
have intrinsic abilities.

***** <Human>
          Human
               The human is the base character.  All other races are 
		compared to them.  Humans can choose any class and are average
		at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any
		other race because of their shorter life spans.  No racial
		adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing human, but
		the light fairies in the dungeon are less aggressive towards them.

***** <Half-Elf>
          Half-Elf
               Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human,  but
            are slightly more frail compared to humans.  Half-elves are 
		slightly better at magic, disarming, saving throws, stealth, bows 
		and searching, but they are not as good at hand weapons.  
		Half-elves may choose any class and have their dexterity sustained.

***** <Elf>
          Elf
               Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
            fighting and have lower wisdom.  Elves are better at searching, 
		disarming, perception, stealth, bows and magic, but they are not 
		as good at hand weapons.  Elves are creatures more of magic than 
		religion, and thus will not be as well suited to be priests or 
		paladins, but they may chose any class.  They are resistant to 
		attacks involving bright light, and have their dexterity sustained.

***** <Hobbit>
          Hobbits
               Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
		have good saving throws.  They also are very good at searching, 
		disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues.  
		They will be much weaker than humans, and not good at melee 
		fighting.  They have a strong hold on their life force, and are 
		thus intrinsically resistant to life draining.  Hobbits cannot 
		chose from the necromancer, druid, or barbarian	classes.
		(the original text here says that hobbit rogues prefer to be 
		called burglars, but in the Hobbit, IIRC, Bilbo was not happy
		about being called a burglar, at least not until he had stolen
		something from Smaug.)

***** <Magic Gnome>
          Magic Gnome
               Magic Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than 
		halflings. They, like the halflings, live in the earth in 
		burrow-like homes.  Gnomes make excellent mages (though they'll
		end up with low hit points), and have very good saving throws.  
		They are good at searching, disarming, magic devices, and 
		stealth.  They have lower strength than humans so they are not 
		very good at fighting with hand weapons.  Gnomes are intrinsically 
		protected against paralysis and some slowing effects.  A magic 
		gnome cannot be a paladin or 	priest because their magic conflicts 
		with prayers.  

***** <Dwarf>
          Dwarf
               Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.
		Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are
		excellent choices for a warrior or priest - or indeed, that
		combination of the two, the paladin.  Dwarves tend to be
		stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
		humans.  Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise,
		they have a good saving throw against spells which are cast 
		on them.  Dwarves also have darkvision, meaning they need no 
		light to see monsters because they live underground.  They 
		do have one big drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and 
		proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no 
		good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In 
		other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth and are not very 
		alert to stealthy monsters.  They can never be blinded.  Dwarves 
		have very few restrictions to their class, but are just not cut 
		out for being a ranger.

***** <Half-Orc>
          Half-Orc
               Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but
		are terrible at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
		and horrible at searching and magic devices.  Half-Orcs are, 
		let's face it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for goods in town.  
		Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues, for the simple 
		reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great constitution and lots 
		of hit points.  Because of their preference to living 
		underground to on the surface, Half-orcs resist darkness 
		attacks.  A Half-orc's intelligence	and attitude is not fitting 
		for being a healer, but they can chose any other class.

***** <Half-Troll>
          Half-Troll
               Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points
		than any other character race.  They are also very stupid and
		slow.  They will make great warriors and iffy priests.  They are 
		abysmal at searching, disarming, magic devices, and stealth, and
		are also not good at using range weapons.  They are so ugly that 
		a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence.  They also happen to be 
		fun to run...  Half-trolls always have their strength sustained, 
		and they regenerate like other trolls.  Unfortunately, this 
		regeneration also requires them to eat more food than other races.
		Half-trolls have no class restrictions, but are not suited well
		for being wizards or rangers.

***** <Dunadan>
          Dunadan
               Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder
		race surpasses human abilities in every field, especially
		constitution.  However, being men of the world, very little is
		new to them, and levels are very hard to gain...  They can play 
		all primary classes except the thief, as Dunedain are too noble to 
		stoop to petty crime (when a Dunadan goes evil, he does it in a 
		much bigger way.)  Their constitution cannot be reduced.

***** <High-Elf>
          High-Elf
               High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard 
		and answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, 
		before the sun and moon were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm 
		for many thousands of years before returning to mortal lands. 
		Because of this, they are far superior in terms of abilities when 
		compared to their lesser Elven kindred. However, they find new 
		experience even harder to come by than Dunedain: and their wisdom is 
		still a little suspect. Like normal Elves, they resist attacks 
		involving bright light and have their intelligence sustained.  High 
		Elves cannot be rogues, tourists, or barbarians.

***** <Kobold>
          Kobold
               Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell 
		underground.  They are intrinsically resistant to most poison.  
		They have a good dexterity and constitution.  However, they are 
		weaker than humans, and also not noted for great intelligence.  
		Furthermore, they are ugly, and not trusted in town.  And while 
		their constitution makes them tough, it still cannot prevent the 
		fact that they are not the biggest of creatures, and have few 
		hit points.  They have no class restrictions, but are not suited 
		well for the wizard or necromancer classes.

***** <Hobglib>
          Hobglib
		   Hobglibs are creatures with very strange personalities who love
		to experiement with magic.  They have tough, leathery skin, and are 
		about the same size as humans, but generally slightly shorter and 
		have a somewhat stumpy appearance. They are slightly stronger and
		more intelligent than humans, but for all their intelligence, they
		are very lacking in wisdom.  They are not particularly ugly, but
		have a very odd personality and people can easily tell that they
		cannot be trusted.  They are very good at magic devices and have
		decent searching, but otherwise their skills are only just barely 
		better than the average human.  Like the kobold, they have some
		intrinsic resistance to poison.  Hobglibs are not interested in much
		besides magic and they lack the discipline to become wizards, so
		they have more class restrictions than any other race.  Their 
		personality fits perfectly with the alchemist class, and they can
		also be rogues, assassins, healers, archers, thieves, or necromancers, 
		which is an odd combination but that's hobglibs for you.

***** <Fairy Gnome>
          Fairy Gnome
		   Fairy Gnomes are the distant relatives of magic gnomes, but have
		very different interests.  Fairy gnomes are gnomes of wisdom and
		have higher wisdom than any other class, they are also smart and 
		fast,	but are seriously lacking in strength and are not good at 
		melee combat.  They are about the size of a hobbit, but not as tough 
		as a hobbit.  They have excellent saving throw and are also good at 
		disarming and searching, but light fairies by nature do not like 
		using magic, which is the primary difference between them and the
		magic gnome.  Being high in the heirarchy of fairies, they are 
		resistant to chaos and have their wisdom sustained.  Fairy gnomes
		being gentle creatures by nature cannot be warriors, assassins, or
		necromancers.

***** <Dark Elf>
          Dark Elf
		  Dark Elves, sometimes known as Drow elves, have grown used to
		living deep underground and most have become evil.  They are nearly
		as good with magic as the high elves, and they are just as strong
		as humans.  Though, like their surface cousins, they are somewhat
		frail and lacking in wisdom.  Also, easily recognised by their
		blackened skin, they are trusted by no one because of their evil
		and cruel reputation.  Once in awhile though, there is a drow elf
		which rejects the evil of its culture.  Being used to harsh 
		circumstances and avoided being seen by those who don't trust them,
		they have great stealth and their skills are better than their 
		surface cousins in almost every way, though not as good as the high
		elves.  They resistance darkness attacks and have their dexterity
		sustained.  They are ideal for the ranger, thief, and assassin 	
		classes, but they cannot be a paladin or tourist.

***** <Living Ghoul>
          Living Ghoul
		   Living Ghouls are former humans, but have dwelt for generations
		around tombs and dungeons and formed a kinship with the undead,
		though they are not undead themselves.  They are outcasts and are
		usually driven away when they come into civilization.  In addition, 
		they have grown sickly from prolonged exposure to necromantic 
		effects.  Their stealth is good, but otherwise their skills are 
		only average, and they are bad as using range weapons.  Due to 
		their kinship with the undead, they	can see invisible monsters and 
		have developed a resistance to nether attacks.  Grave ghouls cannot 
		be tourists.

***** <Power Sprite>
          Power Sprite
		   Only a novelty race to play, Power Sprites are fairies no more 
		than a few inches tall, butthey have troll-sized strength.  They 
		are fast, but lacking in intelligence and wisdom.  They are terrible 
		with magic and disarming, but have a high saving throw due simply to 
		being a fairy.  Their melee power	is second only to the half-troll.  
		Their primary drawback is their size which results in significantly 
		less hit points.  They resist light because of being a light fairy, 
		they have feather falling because of being able to fly, and they 
		resist fear because of their attitude.  Because of their lack in 
		magical ability, Power sprites cannot be wizards, necromancers, 
		druids, or alchemists.

***** <Maia>
          Maia
		   (Special race for players new to the game.)  The Maiar, lesser 
		deities of the created world, often take tangible form and mingle 
		among earthly beings.  They can be found among the ranks of wise 
		counselors, peerless warriors, mighty wizards and deadly 
		necromancers; indeed they can play any class with credit.  Their 
		vital statistics put all other races to shame, their standard 
		abilities are always good and sometimes superlative, and they recover
		divinely quickly from all sorts of wounds and ailments.  Maiar are 
		perfect for those desiring a character able to survive the perils of 
		an un-familiar game.  They resist disenchantment.

***** <Uber Umber Hulk>
          Umber Hulk
		   The Umber Hulk race is a novelty race where you must be the class
		made specifically for them as they do not work well in any profession.  
		Their race/class combo is most similar to a half-troll barbarian except
		an umber hulk has special abilities.  They have incredible strength and 
		good constitution, but horrible intelligence, wisdom, and charisma.  
		They are also terrible with disarming, searching and magic devices, but 
		have a decent saving throw.  Their melee is the best of all races, and 
		their range skills are just as bad as the half-troll's.  They can dig 
		through even granite walls with their bare hands with no trouble at all, 
		and they confuse monsters with their gaze, and cannot be confused 
		themselves.  They are so powerful that occationally their blows will 
		cause earthquakes.  They also always aggravate monsters because of 
		their horrible stealth and the noise they make when they dig.

=== Classes ===
 
 
          Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  Some
          classes  will  not be available to certain races, for instance, a
          Half-Orc cannot become a Paladin.  

***** <Warrior>
          Warrior
                   A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of
		his problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall 
		back on the help of a magical device or a bow.  His prime stats
		are Strength and Constitution, and a good Dexterity can really 
		help at times.  A Warrior will be good at Fighting and 
		Throwing/Bows, but bad at other skills.  His greatest drawback
		is that he cannot use any kind of magic spells or prayers.

***** <Wizard>
          Wizard
               	 A Wizard must survive by his wits.  Though not as frail as 
		the mage of vanilla Angband, he cannot hope to simply hack his 
		way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to 
		defeat, deceive, confuse, and escape.  A wizard is not really 
		complete without an assortment of magical devices to use in 
		addition to his spells.  He can master the higher level magical 
		devices far easier than anyone else.  Intelligence and Dexterity 
		are his primary stats.	There is no rule that says a wizard cannot 
		become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm. 
		Magic realm- Wizardry.

***** <Necromancer>
          Necromancer
		       Similar in many ways to the wizard, a necromancer is weaker 
		than the wizard, and foolishly tries to control demonic and undead 
		forces.  Though he can aquire devastating powers of destruction 
		and unnatural protection from these forces, there is usually a cost
		of attracting demons or draining his own power. His skills 
		are mostly very similar to the wizard.  Magic Realm- Black magic.

***** <Rogue>
          Rogue
                   A Rogue is an outlaw that prefers to live by his cunning,
		but is capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is 
		halfway between a warrior and a thief.  He is the master of traps 
		and locks, no device being impossible for him to overcome.  A rogue 
		has decent stealth, but not as good as the thief.  A rogue's 
		perception is higher than any other class, possibly excepting the 
		thief, and many times he will notice a trap or secret door before 
		having to search.  A rogue is better than warriors or paladins with 
		magical devices.  Rogues can also learn a few spells, but no powerful 
		offensive spells like the wizard or necromancer.  A rogue's primary 
		stats are Dexterity and Strength. Magic Realm- Chance magic.

***** <Ranger>
          Ranger
                   A Ranger has learned many skills, studying from warriors, 
		archers and druids.  He is a decent fighter, has good stealth, and 
		is second only to the archer in the use of bows. The ranger learns 
		spells much more slowly than his teacher, the druid, but is capable 
		of learning all but the most powerful nature realm spells.  A ranger 
		has great searching and disarming, and a good saving throw.  His 
		primary stats are Strength and Intelligence. Magic Realm- Nature.

***** <Paladin>
          Paladin
                  A Paladin is a holy knight chosen by his god.  He is an excellent 
		melee fighter, but not very good at missile weapons.  He learns 
		prayers at a slower pace then the priest, but can use all but the 
		most powerful prayers including a few powerful ones which the priest
		cannot learn. Because a paladin is really a dual class character, it
		requires more experience to advance him.  A paladin lacks much in the 
		way of skills. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and 
		magical devices.  He has a good saving throw due to his divine 
		alliance.  His primary stats are Strength and Wisdom. 
		'Magic' Realm- Prayer.

***** <Archer>
	  Archer
		   Archery is his specialty, but he is not too bad at fighting up 
		close when he needs to.  Besides fighting, his skills are most 
		similar to a warrior's including average disarming, and very bad 
		magic device skill but his saving throw is better than the warrior's.  
		He can learn some spells in the alchemy realm, mostly having to do 
		with missile combat including the ammo branding spells, but he can 
		also learn a few utility spells. His primary stats are Strength and
		Dexterity. Magic Realm- Alchemy.

***** <Alchemist>
	  Alchemist
		  The Alchemist is an experiementer with potions, metals, and magic.
		The alchemist is familiar with the elements of acid and poison 
		because of dealing with chemicals and potions. Due to learning by
		trial and error, they do not chose which magic recipe they will learn
		next. They are not strong, have bad stealth, and are mediocure 
		fighters.  Their skills are all around average, but they do learn 
		stinking cloud as their very first spell which helps a lot in the 
		early stages. And someday he just might find the recipe for the 
		elixer of life, though whether he mixes it correctly is another 
		matter.. Magic Realm- Alchemy.

***** <Priest>
          Priest
                  A Priest is a character of devotion their god.  They explore the
		dungeon only to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if 
		treasure just happens to fall into their packs, well, so much more 
		to the glory of their church!  Priests receive their spells from a 
		deity, and therefore do not choose which spells they will learn.  
		They are familiar with magical devices, but are not as good as a 
		mage in their use.  Priests have good saving throws, and not 
		horrible at fighting, but they are not as good at using sharp 
		weapons (swords and polearms) owing to the Church's strictures about 
		shedding blood: so they are better off using blunt weapons such as 
		staffs.  Wisdom is the priest's primary stat. 'Magic' Realm- Prayer.

***** <Healer>
	  Healer
		  The healer starts out with the dungeon prayerbook which specializes
		in healing.  Though he is a master at healing and curing his own
		wounds, he is completely at a loss as to inflicting them on his 
		enemies. At least he does not have the restriction on edged weapons
		which the priest has. In most areas, his skills are average, but his 
		saving throw along with the priest is better than any other class.
		Being an extremely specialized class, he advances faster than most
		classes.  Unlike the priest, he uses intelligence as his prayer stat 
		instead of wisdom. Magic realm- prayer.

***** <Druid>
	  Druid
		  Wise and learned in the ways of nature and wild magic, he can learn
		to summon all kinds of storms, even volcanic eruptions, making his 
		attack spells nearly as powerful as the wizard or necromancer. His 
		stealth and skills are all good, and he is not ignorant in the art
		of fighting either, though, like the priest, he prefers not to use 
		edged weapons. His primary stat is wisdom. Magic realm- nature.

***** <Assassin>
	  Assassin
		  The lover of shadows and death, the assassin is a cross between the
		rogue and necromancer.  His skills are very similar to the rogue's,
		except he is not nearly as good with disarming and searching.  Though
		not quite as good with melee as the rogue, he is quite skilled with 
		the crossbow and he can learn some of the necromancer's spells of
		destruction. His primary stats are dexterity and intelligence. 
		Magic Realm- black magic.

***** <Thief>
	  Thief
		  A master of quickness, the thief is faster and more stealthy than
		any other class. He is weaker in strength and in fighting than the
		rogue, but is significantly better with magic. Magic Realm- Alchemy.

***** <Tourist>
	  Tourist
		  A unique class which is hard to do well with, the tourist is very
		bad at fighting and in just about every other skill except searching.
		He advances in levels faster than any class except the warrior. The
		Tourist starts with a useful camera flash spell which can stun monsters
		and he learns spells from the chance realm which has many random-
		effect spells.

***** <War Mage>
	  War Mage
			The War mage, as you'd guess, is a wizard who is especially 
		good at attack spells and combat buffs, while not quite as good at 
		other	areas of magic as the wizard. In most ways he is very similar 
		to the wizard, being even more weak and frail but a little more 
		skilled in melee combat.  His magic device skill is the best of all 
		classes and his saving throw and alertness are also better than the 
		wizards'.

***** <Barbarian>
	  Barbarian
		  The barbarian is easily the most powerful class as far as strength
		and toughness and is just a good as the warrior as far as fighting skill.
		His fighting style is different from the warrior's because the barbarian
		does not easily get multiple attacks but instead he gets a significant 
		bonus while wielding heavy weapons.  His disarming and magic device
		skills are abysmal, and his saving throw and searching aren't much 
		better, but he advances just as fast as the tourist.  And he can learn 
		a few spells from the nature realm but he's doesn't get very good at it.
		Not being very smart, he relies on wisdom instead of intelligence to 
		use the little bit of magic that he can learn.
 

=== Stats ===

          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee
               combat.  A high strength can improve your chances of hitting
               as well as the amount of damage done with each hit.  Char-
               acters with low strengths may receive penalties.  Strength
               is also useful in tunnelling and in carrying heavy items.
 
          Intelligence
                Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities most spellcasters.  
		Intelligence will affect the number of spells you may learn each 
		level as well as the number of spell points you receive.  A high
               intelligence may also improve your chances of successfully
               casting a spell.  You cannot learn spells if your intelligence
               is 7 or lower.  A good intelligence can also help with using
               magic devices, picking locks, and disarming traps.
 
          Wisdom
                The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability of a 
		priest, paladin, druid, or barbarian to use their prayers, just like 
		intelligence affects spellcasting.  Again, high wisdom will 
		increase the number of spell points you have and increase the 
		number of prayers you can learn each level, while improving the 
		chance that a prayer will be successful.  A good wisdom can also
               help to improve your chances of resisting magical spells cast
               upon you by monsters.
 
          Dexterity
               Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high
               dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with
               lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and
               will increase his chances of hitting with any weapon and
               dodging blows from enemies.  Dexterity is also useful in
               picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting yourself from
               some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if 
               the character has a high enough dexterity, thieves will
               never be successful in stealing from the player.
 
          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
               body, and to recover from damage received.  Therefore a
               character with a high constitution will receive more hit
               points and also recover them faster while resting.
 
          Charisma
               Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
               appearance.  A character with a high charisma will receive
               better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a
               very low charisma may be robbed blind. 
 

=== Abilities ===

          Characters possess some different abilities which can help them
          to survive.  The starting abilities of a character are based upon
          race and class.  Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats,
          and may increase with the level of the character.

	    Alertness
		   Alertness is how well you notice stealthy monsters. Characters
		   who are not very alert may not notice a stealthy monster until 
		   he is right next to it.  Alertness does not increase with level.

          Fighting
               Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
               fists.  Normally a character gets a single blow from any
               weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are high enough,
               he may receive more blows per round with lighter weapons.
               Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
               opponent.  This skill increases with the level of the char-
               acter.
 
          Shooting Ability
               Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is
               included in this skill.  Different stats apply to different
               weapons, but this ability may modify the distance an object
               is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done, and the ability
               to hit a creature.  This skill increases with the level of
               the character.
 
          Saving Throws
               A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the
               effects of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.
               This does not include spells cast on the player by his own
               stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty potion.  This ability
               increases with the level of the character, but then most
               high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it
               tends to even out.  A high wisdom also increases this abil-
               ity.
 
          Stealth
               The ability to move silently about is very useful.  Charac-
               ters with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents,
               gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to notice
               a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid
               certain fights.  This skill is based entirely upon race and
               class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
          Disarming
               Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also
               includes picking locks on traps and doors.  A successful
               disarming will gain the character some experience.  A trap
               must be found before it can be disarmed.  Dexterity and
               intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and this
               ability increases with the level of the character.
 
          Magical Devices
               Using a magical device such as a wand or staff  requires
               experience and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and
               priests are therefore much better at using a magical device
               than say a warrior.  This skill is modified by intelligence,
               and increases with the level of the character.

          Searching Frequency (Perception)
               Perception is the ability to notice hidden traps and doors 
		   without actively seeking it out.  This skill is based 
               entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless 
               magically enhanced.

          Searching Ability (Searching)
               To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
               and traps on chests.  Rogues are the best at searching, but
               mages, rangers, and priests are also good at it.  This skill
               is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
               improve unless magically enhanced.


 
=== Stat Bonus Tables ===

Stat, hit dice, infravision and experience points per level modifications 
due to race are listed in the following table.  To get the total hit dice 
and XP modifier, add the "race" and "class" numbers: for instance, a 
Dwarf Priest has a hit die of 11+2=13 (i.e. he will get 1d13 hit points per 
level, adjusted for constitution) and an XP modifier of 20+20=40%.

*Assassins get +1 to stealth at character level 26.

For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the base 
level of the ability, while the second figure (in parentheses) is the bonus
that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out the
total skill value of any character's skills, add the "race" value to the
"class" value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels that the character
has.

(Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing 
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats 
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw,
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical items.)

=== Stat rollers ===

There are currently three different ways to determine the starting stats of
your character - you can choose which one to use from the birth screen.

***** <Point-based>
          Point-based
              The point-based method allows you to "buy" improvements to
              your basic stats by "spending" points on them.  You have a
              fixed number of points to spend, and making small changes
              to a stat costs proportionally less than making large changed.
              Any unspent points are converted into your starting money that 
              you can use to buy equipment at the start of the game.

              This is the recommended birth method.

***** <Autoroller>
          Autoroller
              The autoroller allows you to choose minimum values for your
              stats, and then repeated "rolls" random characters using
              Angband's traditional stat-rolling system until your creteria
              have been met (or an insanely large number of rolls have been
              made without finding one that matches your choices).

          Standard roller
              The standard roller is the traditional Angband method of
              determining the starting stats for a character, it simply
              "rolls" up a single set of starting values, and gives you
              the choice of asking for another "roll" to be made or 
              accepting the current outcome.  This can obviously make for
              harder characters to play than the other two methods as
              you are less likely to have high values in the stats that might
              be most useful to you.

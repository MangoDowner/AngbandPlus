#####R=== Mimics ===

#####GDescription
Mimics possess the ability to transform into various creatures using 
special cloaks. While transformed, they lose their intrinsic abilities, 
and gain those of the creature they have transformed into.

#####GPrimary Stats
Dexterity (spell casting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
Mimics don't use spellbooks specifically, and as such do not study any
realm of magic. However, they are able to use the specialised powers 
inherent in many cloaks found within the dungeon (cloaks of mimicry).
These cloaks are activated using the "m" command, and enable the Mimic
to change form.

In addition to activating cloaks, the Mimic also has the ability to use
some personal spells, which are also activated by the "m" command.

#####GStarting Equipment
A mimic begins the game with:
    A cloak of mimicry [Wolf]
    A potion of healing
    A dagger
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:

HALF-ELF
----------

Half-Elves are a cross between an elf and a human. Outside of
Nimbraya, there are little Half-Elves, as the Elves lives mostly
in the southern forests of Portralis. In Nimbraya, however, they
are very abundant, as humans and elves coexist peacefully in
this beautiful kingdom. In the very religious kingdom of Nimbraya,
half-elves who wish to be part of the religious community
generally become monks instead of priests, as they are less
magical, but stronger than normal elves. Half-Elves are therefore
very common in Nimbraya.

Half-Elves shares traits from both races. They are a little more
dextrous, but a little frailer and weaker than humans. They tend 
to be a little wiser, but tend to be less creative. They are good at
spellcasting and archery, but do not learn other skills as easily
as their human counterparts. However, the Nimbrayan tradition
of Half-Elves monks have made martial arts a common practice
amongst all half-elven citizens. As such, most half-elves know
some martial arts, and they make amongst the best monks in Portralis.

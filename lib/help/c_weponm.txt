#####R=== Weaponmasters ===

#####GDescription
The Weaponmaster is a Warrior who specializes in *ONE* class of weapons,
chosen by his or her Masters when the future Weaponmaster begins 
training, based on a perceived need to balance the number of specialists
out there with each weapon type. The training is so intense and specific
that Weaponmasters gain huge bonuses when fighting with their chosen
weapon, bonuses that increase with level. With any other weapon, 
however, they are quite inept and never get more than one extra blow 
(regardless of any other factors) with such weapons. They aren't much 
good with bows or magical items, either, since their training focused 
so intently upon their specialty weapon. In most other respects they 
perform about as well as a generic Warrior.

** THE WORLD OF PORTRALIS **

The world is the world Portralis. The large continent of Portralis
is surrounded by a great ocean known as the Infinite, as no
sailors were ever able to cross it, and nobody knows whether or
not there are other worlds across the sea. For this reasons, many
sailors believed for a long time that the sea has no end, thus
calling it the Infinite.

To the north of Portralis lies a territory of snow, glaciers, frozen
lakes and rivers, and a climate of extreme coldness. Night is long
in the north of Portralis, and bright, sunny days are inexistant.
The temperature is extremely cold, and few animals and creatures
lives there. However, the powerful kingdom of Rhyzendal is
established in the north. Rhyzendal peoples are almost all of
fiendish origins, although they are generally not too aggressive.
The north is populated with numerous towns and cities, all part
of the great kingdom of Rhyzendal.

To the east of Portralis are the great mountains of Agharias.
According to dwarven religion, Agharias was a powerful titan of
stone, and is the one who created the dwarven race from the earth.
Whether this is true or not, there are countless of cave temples
dedicated to this dwarven deity in the mountains. Near the mountains
lies the great kingdom of Ivhala, where the strongest warriors of
Portralis lives, and is one of the few human settlements where
dwarves actually lives in good number.

To the west of Portralis is the technological country of Karingen,
the most technologically and scientifically advanced of the kingdoms,
where many human and gnomes alchemists and inventors gathers. The
kingdom is established near the Varkoth river, in the Varkothian
plains. According to Portralis legends, Varkoth was a great gold
dragon, and the plains were once great mountains. Varkoth was a
good dragon, and the guardian of the peoples native to what was once
the Varkothian mountains. However, one day, he fought against his
arch enemy, the evil dragon Surogoth, and they fought a legendary
battle to death. When the situation became hopeless, legend says
that Varkoth gathered the power of the light, and used a breath of
light of godly strength, turning his rival into dust, as well as all
the mountains that were in the path of the great beam of light,
turning the landscape into plains. This is how the plains got their
name.

Finally, to the south of Portralis lies the great elvish kingdom
of Nimbraya, as well as the great Nimbrayan forest. According to the
legend, Nimbraya was the first elvish queen of the kingdom, daughter
of the legendary god Daldumaar, who is worshipped by the peoples of
Nimbraya. According to the legend, Daldumaar was a powerful and good
king, who protected peoples from the evil influence of Nimbraya's
legendary evil, a being called Dumos Arikyenzal. Supposedly,
Daldumaar left the kingdom to his daughter, Nimbraya, and went on
a quest to defeat the powerful, immortal evil. Arikyenzal was
supposedly immortal, and no weapons or magics could destroy or 
simply hurt him at all. Therefore, Daldumaar gathered all his magic,
and sacrificed his life to erase the powerful evil from existance.
This is how Dumos Arikyenzal was defeated, and ever since then,
Daldumaar is worshipped in Nimbraya, his spirit watching over the
kingdom.

The year is now 700 AGD, "After the Great Discovery". 700 years ago,
a magical crystalline stone known as the Licialhyd(or Licial,
as it is commonly called) was discovered. Magical stones and 
crystals have been used for milleniums by mages and priests, to 
store magical and divine power, and create powerful artifacts. 
However, no stone in history has been able to contain as much 
magical power as the Licialhyd. The Licialhyd, discovered
in the dark mines of Jindark, were massively extracted, and sent
to all the major cities of Portralis. Each of the five great
kingdoms of Portralis received the Licialhyds, and used their powers
to create great cities and powerful artifacts.

KINGDOM OF JINDAR
-----------------

The very first kingdom in the history of Portralis, Jindar was built 
5000 years ago, and for a long time has been believed to be the 
center of the world. Though this has later been proved wrong, Jindar 
is still widely acknowledged as the largest kingdom of Portralis. The 
current king of Jindar, Julian Strongheart, is a brave and charismatic 
leader and warrior, and is widely considered to be the greatest king 
in all Portralis.

Jindar is also a city within the kingdom, and it the kingdom's most 
powerful city. Jindar's population is mostly human, with a few members 
of every other races. Jindar is known for it's diversity in terms of 
culture and tradition. Many religions are practiced within the same 
kingdom, and wars between religious factions is, unfortunately, common 
within Jindar. Many peoples prefers not to join any religions, fearing 
represal from the numerousother factions.

When Jindar received the Licialhyd, many of the religious cults 
quickly turned the powerful ores into bridges between this world 
and other planes, therefore summoning divine messengers to aid their 
faithfuls... or netherworldly creatures to punish the infidels. Other 
uses of the Licialhyd has been mostly to aid the wizards channeling 
their magical powers, and thus powerful rods have been created. The 
magical rods of Jindar are well known for their effectiveness, and 
are a most prized to treasures to those who can afford them.

KINGDOM OF KARINGEN
-------------------

Built only 800 years ago, Karingen is the youngest kingdom in Portralis. 
Yet, ironically, Karingen is also the most advanced kingdom in terms of 
science and technology. Being young, and without great religious customs 
or ancient traditions, this has pushed the kingdom toward creation, 
innovation and discovery. Karingen's most prized secret is the science 
of mechanic. Mechanical objects are common in Karingen, and Karingen's 
Crossbows are amongst the finest ranged weapons in the world. Rumors of 
even more advanced Karingenian weaponry is commonly heard in Portralis. 
Some rare rumors suggest the existance of powerful, steam powered 
mechanical automatons, with advanced weaponry beyond a mortal's dreams, 
although Karingen claims these rumors are false... and impossible.

Karingen was the first kingdom to receive the Licialhyds, as peoples 
knew that Karingen could make great use of these stones. Karingen used 
the Licialhyds to improve their technology, and have often used them 
as a source of power for their mechanical inventions.

Karingen's king is Marek Harrington. A young, brillant man and inventor, 
Marek's greatest political achievement is to assimilate the Gnomish race 
within the walls of Karingen. Already well known as inventors, gnomes 
were at first hesitant to share their secrets with the humans. However, 
thanks to Marek's efforts, humans and gnomes now lives together in 
harmony within the same kingdom.

KINGDOM OF IVHALA
-----------------

A kingdom of warriors, with an history of 3500 years, Ivhala is known 
for it's Defenders, a special caste of warrior heavily focused on 
defensive techniques, and are often acknoweledged as the toughest 
warriors of Portralis. Ivhalian armors are easily the hardest and most 
effective in the world, and combined with the Ivhalians natural 
toughness and strength, Ivhalian Defenders are said to be nearly 
invincible in combat.

While Ivhalian men are used in combat as Defenders, women are often 
trained to become enchantresses, and their role in enchanting the 
magical armors and weapons are vital to the kingdom's success. Ever 
since the Licialhyd was given to Ivhala, enchantresses have used it 
to further improve the magical armors of the kingdom, and have 
created some fine pieces of nearly legendary power.

Ruling Ivhala is queen Christina, also know as the Iron Maiden. 
Christina did not earn this name because of a cold heart, but rather 
because she was the first and only woman to ever become a Defender. 
Very tough for a woman, she has bested the finest men in melee combat, 
and she is said to never have been defeated in combat, even as a 
young lady and against much stronger and tougher men.

Ivhala is populated by humans, although it is not rare to see dwarves 
within Ivhalian walls. Dwarves and Ivhalians have a lot in common 
when it comes to warriors, as both dwarven warriors and Ivhalian 
defenders are tough and heavily armored warriors.

KINGDOM OF NIMBRAYA
-------------------

The total opposite of Ivhala, Nimbraya is a magical kingdom with 
elvish influence. In fact, half of Nimbraya's population are pure 
elves, and most of the other peoples are of elvish descendance. 
Nimbraya was built 4200 years ago, and was a simple fort built 
by both elven wizards and archers, and human warriors, to hold 
against an invasion of orcs, ogres and trolls. Victorious in the 
war, the human and elves decided to remain allied together, and 
decided to turn the humble fort into a prestigious city. Built in 
the middle of the southern forest of Alariel, Nimbraya became 
a great kingdom, and the greatest city, Nimbra, is known as the most 
beautiful city in the world. Nimbrayan structures ressemble ancient 
temples, and magical stones are often used to decorate them. 
The kingdom's beauty is one of Nimbraya's greatest pride.

When Nimbraya received the Licialhyd, the Nimbrayan wizards 
quickly used it to create magic spells of great power, as well 
as to include it in the construction of their magnificient buildings. 
Licialhyd has also been used in Nimbrayan jewelry, and Nimbrayan 
amulets and rings are the most beautiful, and the most prized.

Nimbraya is also a religious kingdom, and the high elven priestess 
Elowyn Surayel is also the kingdom's leader. The religion is 
the Daldumarian religion, and is based around the teachings of 
Daldumaar, the legendary founder of Nimbraya. According to the 
religion, Daldumaar was born with divine blood flowing trough his 
veins, and is said to be the child of an elven mother, and a father 
from the realm of gods. Daldumaar is said to have the strength and 
wisdom of the gods, and that it is thanks to his powerful magic 
that the orcs, ogres and trolls were defeated milleniums ago. 
Daldumaar is also said to have defeated Nimbraya's legendary 
destroyer, known as Dumos Arikyenzal. Arikyenzal has been known as 
a source of great evil, and no one knows what his true form was. 
Battling the thousands of minions of the powerful evil, Daldumaar 
finally defeated him, and brought peace to Nimbraya. Once peace 
has returned, and the kingdom, Daldumaar is said to have left the 
kingdom, and gone on a long journey. Details of Daldumaar's depart 
is still a mystery...

KINGDOM OF RHYZENDAL
--------------------

The dark, cold, northern kingdom of Rhyzendal is unlike any other 
kingdoms. Night is long, the climate is cold, snow is everywhere, 
and the population is made up of netherworldly lesser demons who 
have been summoned in the world of Portralis, most likely summoned 
trough the rituals of the various Jindar cults. Rhyzendalian 
cities are made of pure, magical ice, that even the strongest flame 
cannot melt. Though all the other four kingdoms fear the natives 
of Rhyzendal, little trouble ever come from them. No longer bound 
by the evil of their native planes, the fiendish population of 
Rhyzendal is rather peaceful, and prefers to be left alone in their 
country rather than having bloody wars with the other kingdoms.

Compared to the other kingdoms, Rhyzendal received a limited 
quantity of Licialhyds, the other kingdoms fearing that if Rhyzendal 
gets their hands on large quantities, they would become very 
dangerous, and declare war with the other kingdoms. As a result, 
while they did create some magical objects out of the Licialhyd, 
Rhyzendalians do not have any great use for it. In recent years, 
the other kingdoms have started to gain a little more trust toward 
Rhyzendal, and they are slowly starting to receive more of the 
Licialhyds, although kingdoms are still very hesitant to deal with 
the cold kingdom.

Rhyzendal's king is Soroth Zenras, a lesser demon of humanoid 
form, and is a dark and mysterious warrior. There are hundreds of 
rumors concerning him, and nobody knows enough about Soroth to be 
sure whether the rumors are true or false. Some says he is an evil 
overlord who is preparing a massive assault on the other kingdoms. 
Some other says he is involved in many of the dark rituals of 
Jindarian cultists. Some more optimistic peoples says that Soroth 
is actually a good man, and puts his dark powers to the service
of good.


** THE RACES OF PORTRALIS **

HUMANS

Humans are the predominant race in Portralis. They are everywhere, 
in every kingdoms, except perhaps Rhyzendal. From major cities to 
small, rural towns, to wild forests and jungles, to mountains, 
humans are found in every single parts of the world. They were 
the first to arrive in Portralis milleniums ago, and ever since 
they built the first kingdom of Jindar, they have been the most 
widespread and possibly the most powerful of the races.

ELVES

Elves are native to the southern forests of Portralis. They are 
slightly shorter than humans, are generally frailer but more 
dextrous, and are distinguishable from humans by their fair, 
pale skin and pointed ears. Legends tells that originally, there 
was no elves living on Portralis. Legend tells that their origins 
lies in another world, in another place,  but that some of 
them somehow ended up here. They adapted themselves to the new 
land, and have found home in the southern forests. Though not as 
widespread as humans, elves have significant power and influence 
in Portralis,  especially in the magical lore. Elves are also known 
to be the finest archers in the world.

DWARVES

Dwarves are the hardy, short mountain peoples of Portralis. 
They are short, but tough, and dwarven males are almost always 
bearded. Dwarves have lived in the mountain caverns for as long 
as history can remember, and are known to be tough, strong 
and hard working peoples. They are also known for their fine 
warriors and mastery of the axe. Dwarven axes are of very high 
quality, and so are the dwarven armors. They are mostly found 
in their mountain homelands, although some of them have chosen
to establish themselves in the kingdom of Ivhala.

GNOMES

Cousins of the dwarves, gnomes are weaker and even smaller 
than dwarves, but they make up for it by being intelligent and 
creative, and are known to be fine alchemists and inventors. 
Originally living in gnomish clans in the mountains with the 
dwarves, Gnomes have almost all migrated to the kingdom of 
Karingen, because this is where their skills are used the most.

KOBOLDS

These wild, short, greenish reptilian creatures were thought 
to be weak and ineffective. This was true in the past, often 
used as slaves by other, stronger evil races. However, 1000 
years ago, something unexpected happened, and kobolds united 
together, and rebelled against their masters. These evil races 
were defeated, and many historians associate the dissappearance 
of the orcs and ogres to the kobolds. Kobolds are now 
widespread in the wilderness and filthy areas such as sewers and
the like, as well as caves and dungeons. Having lived in filthy 
areas during most of their history, and having used all kind of 
poisons on their weapons to make up for their small size, Kobolds 
are the vicious masters of poison, and are nearly immune to it. 
Not all kobolds are evil, but they are generally impatient and 
aggressive, especially toward Devlings, which they consider 
rivals.

DEVLINGS

Devlings are descendants of imps and various lesser demons. 
Like the kobolds, these minor demons were often used as slaves 
and minions by more powerful archfiends. But about 700 years ago, 
a great revolt known as the Devling War erupted in the planes 
of hell, and a battle between the devlings and the greater 
demons raged. Details of the Devling War are rare, as not many 
witnessed it, but it is known that devlings eventually moved out 
of the planes of hell, and came to the prime material plane to 
live in caves, dungeons, and sometimes in civilized kingdoms. 
Devlings are generally red skinned, though there are also green, 
black, purple and orange ones, about three feet tall, and have 
short pointed ears, a tail and strong, powerful legs. Devlings 
are known to fight in large, organized groups, and are known 
rivals to the kobolds, although devlings can be seen in cities, 
and are generally less aggressive than kobolds, despites their 
demonic origins. They generally fight with long weapons like 
spears and polearms.

CELESTIALS

Celestials are the holy beings that lives in the planes of heaven, 
and represent good and justice. While the greater celestials, such 
as archangels and divine beings rarely descend on the prime material 
planes, prefering to assist the mortals indirectly, the lesser 
messengers of heaven are sometimes sent to the prime material plane 
when evil is rising in power, or to protect a kingdom from
corruption or abuses. These celestials generally ressemble humans, 
but have some special features, generally a glowing aura of light, 
and have large, white angelic wings. Celestials have started to 
appear in Portralis, and yet the reason of their appearance is 
still unknown. Orcs, trolls and ogres have been defeated, there are 
no sign of attacks from the planes of hell, and none of the current 
rulers shows sign of potential corruption. And yet, Celestials have 
been sighted, and are warning the peoples of an incoming threat... 
of a nature that is yet unknown.

DEMONS

Demons of any kind are usually attacked on sight by most races, save 
from the citizens of Rhyzendal, the fiendish population of the cold 
kingdom. Looking humanoid in appearance, the citizens of Rhyzendal 
generally have grey skin, large demon wings, short horns and a tail, 
the most common appearance of the lesser demons which have been 
summoned from the upper planes of hell. While no longer bound to the 
evil of hell, and trying to become more peaceful, the demons of 
Rhyzendal have not lost their persuasive and seductive manners, and 
since they are known to be intelligent and cunning, other kingdoms 
do not trust them, and are highly hesistant to trade with them, 
preferring to leave them alone in their kingdom.

ZULGORS

Some extremely rare humans are born with a very strange power... 
The first sign of this mysterious power is a strange hair and eyes 
coloration, generally made of two different bright colors, and strange, 
distorting feeling to anyone who approaches them. These peoples, 
while looking like ordinary peoples, are actually extremely 
strong, and can lift unelievable weight. Even those that do not look 
strong at all possess strength greater than that of ten dwarves. 
Furthermore, these peoples use unusual type of magics with great skill, 
magics that are often distorting and disruptive. Some researchers 
claims that these peoples are zulgors, mythic beings with bodies made 
of chaotic force, and said to have legendary strength and the power to 
alter every aspects of reality. Some claims the zulgors are just legends, 
other claims they are powerful demons or spirits... Nevertheless, the 
mysterious powers of these "zulgors" is a great mystery, and little is 
known at all about the zulgors...

** THE LICIALHYD **

The "Great Discovery" refers to the discovery the purest and most magical 
stone ever to be found, the Licialhyd. The Licialhyd was first discovered 
700 years ago by Drem Oswald, a gnomish alchemist looking for a pure magical 
stone for his experiments. The stone was discovered in the mountains of 
Agharias, and was soon extracted by dwarven miners. It did not take long to 
realize the great potential the stone had, and the Licialhyd was massively 
extracted. Every kingdoms then used the Licialhyd for various purposes, be it 
the creation of magical weapons, armors, or for scientific and alchemic 
purposes.

However, perhaps the most common use of the Licialhyd is as a magical tool.
Licialhyd gems are enchanted with powerful magic that is benefical to the
possessor of the gem, and once they use their gem, their abilities and
physical or magical aptitudes are augmented, allowing them to perform tasks
that they couldn't perform otherwise. Licialhyd can be bought in magic
stores in almost any towns and cities, and is probably one of the most sold
item in all Portralis. Many adventurers bring some Licialhyds with them,
and use them in times of trouble to increase their chance of survival.

** DEMISE OF THE ORCS **

At the time when Portralis was discovered, and the kingdom of Jindar was 
founded, it was populated with the orcish race. Strong, aggressive, 
beast-like, green skinned humanoids that stroke fear in the human and 
dwarven races. They once populated the eastern mountains were the 
dwarves lives, and the two races fought countless battles against each 
others. But the orcs were more ambitious than just conquering the 
mountains. They wanted to control the entire world of Portralis, eradicate 
the humans and the dwarves, and make their orcish empire the greatest 
power in existance. As a result, orcs often formed great legions, and 
attacked human and dwarven settlements, ravaging them with deadly might 
and cruelty.

Furthermore, orcs had powerful allies: the ogres. Ogres were large, tall 
and extremely strong humanoid creatures that were known to carry gigantic 
weapons, and enjoyed slaying and eating the races they considered "lesser". 
Because they were also living in the eastern mountains, the orcs and ogres 
were used to live together, and soon realizing their interests were very 
similar, they joined their forces to get rid of the humans and dwarves.

Also, unlike humans and dwarves, orcs generally did not make their own 
weaponry. They had them made by the kobolds, a race of small, greenish 
reptilian humanoids, which they considered inferior beings, and instead 
took more time to train in actually using the weapons than making them. 
Kobolds were slaves of the orcs, and made all the weapons, armors, as 
well as taking care of the mundane shores. Orcs made the kobolds live in 
the most filthy places, from junk yards to unclean slave pits, and 
generally fed them with the most disgusting of the foods. Countless kobolds 
died of diseases and poisoning, and only those who could adapt to these
cruel conditions survived. However, kobolds were known to breed rather 
quickly, so the orcs did not care about the loss of their slaves.

During this time, humans and dwarves formed their first alliances. 
At first, dwarves were hesitant to ally with humans, being a proud race 
and claiming that they did not need any help, and they could defeat the 
orcs alone. Then, the war continued to rage. Orcs and ogres were 
outnumbering the dwarves, and soon, the dwarves found themselves in serious 
trouble, losing more and more peoples every days. Eventually, major dwarven 
cities started to fall in the hands of the enemy, and powerful and respected 
dwarven leaders were brutally slain in most humiliating fashions. The
dwarves then realized that their pride and stubborness were killing them, 
and thus they accepted the aid of the humans. The new alliance between the 
humans and the dwarves gave hope to the brave warriors, and together, they 
were finally able to retaliate to the orcish invasion.

The war lasted for centuries. As the elves were starting to increase in 
number, they soon joined the humans and dwarves, seeing the orcs as a threat 
to the balance and beauty of nature. With the three races united, the two 
sides started to become more even. As both sides were weakening each others, 
they eventually fell short of warriors, and the savage war that lasted 
for hundred of years was finally put to and end... Humans, elves and dwarves 
rebuilt their cities, and so did the orcs. But orc bandits and raiders 
were common thing, and the orcs were still considered a threat.

The conflicts with the orcs never really stopped. Humans, elves and 
dwarves were still the victim of orcish attacks, but they would eventually 
retaliate, and defeat the orcs. Then the orcs would return, causing a 
never-ending cycle of war. This lasted for around 4000 years... until 
the most unexpected event happened. After milleniums of slavery, the 
fast-breeding kobolds eventually fully adapted to their poisonous 
environment, and deaths due to illnesses became extremely rare. They, 
in fact, developped a great mastery in the art of using and resisting
poisons. Then one day, the kobolds decided that they are worth more than 
just slaves, and that it was time the orcs and ogres pay for the years 
of slavery. And so they started a huge revolution, arming themselves with 
small, but highly poisoned weapons, an attack that the orcs and ogres 
did not excpect at all, taking the slavery of kobolds for granted. The 
attack took them by surprise, and the kobolds inflicted major casualties 
to the orcs and ogres. Then, the humans, elves and dwarves saw this as 
a major opportunity to launch a massive attack against the
orcs, and perhaps finally eradicate them. And so they launched their 
assault. For the first time, the kobolds fought along with the humans, 
elves and dwarves in a big, united assault. The orcs and ogres fought 
back, but this time, it was they who were greatly outnumbered. And after 
100 years of warfare, the orcs finally lost the war, and were exterminated, 
along with the ogres. A great celebration was held, and a hope for an 
ever-lasting peace was born. Then, the kobolds returned to their 
underground caves, and soon started populating them. Kobolds were still
aggressive, and the anger of centuried of slavery was still burning in 
their eyes. Some even feared that the kobolds would eventually start 
another big war like the first orcish war, but that never actually 
happened. Though the kobolds can be aggressive with intruders in their 
territories, they generally did not go out of their caves, and left the 
other races alone.

Today, 700 AGD, orcs have not been forgotten. They will always be remembered 
as a strong, wild and cruel race of invaders. Some peoples claims that 
there are still some rare orcs alive today, and that they are hidden in the 
most secret areas of Portralis, slowly reproducing with the hope of one day 
reviving the pride and might of their ancestors. Some even claim to have 
seen actual orcs, although these rumors have all been proven to be false.

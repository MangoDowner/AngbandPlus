=== Version Information ===

This file was last updated for Psiband 1.3.0.

Make sure to read the newsgroup ("rec.games.roguelike.angband"), and to visit
the Official Angband Home Page ("http://thangorodrim.angband.org") for the
most up to date information about Angband.

Angband has an incredibly complex history, and is the result of a lot of 
work by a lot of people, all of whom have contributed their time and energy 
for free, being rewarded only by the pleasure of keeping alive one of the
best freeware games available anywhere.

Psiband 1.3.0 is a variant of Angband: specifically, one which incorporates
the AD&D concept of psionics. Psionics were an optional addition to AD&D 1st 
Edition: having been removed originally in the 2nd Edition, they were later 
reinstated in the form we know today, with a separate Psionicist class with
six major discplines to choose between. It was this form that Aram Harrow 
first tried to merge with standard Angband. 

Early attempts were somewhat buggy (as always), and the game suffered from 
a lack of playtesting: in particular, when psionic monsters were introduced 
in Psiband 1.0.6, nobody thought to test out how non-psionicists would fare 
against monster psionics. An attempt to merge the variant with another 
variant, ZAngband, failed: the fact that ZAngband already had a serviceable
"Mindcrafter" class which ran on somewhat different principles but was 
essentially psychic in nature meant that people carried on simply playing 
Mindcrafters. Nevertheless, there were many good ideas for features and 
gameplay that were worth saving for future versions.

Psiband 1.0.7 fixed some of the worst bugs with Psiband 1.0.6, and at least
made the game playable with non-psionicists against monster psionics. It was 
shortly after this point that I (Jonathan Ellis) became interested in the 
variant, and started playing it.  This was also about the time I became 
interested in hacking the info.txt files of standard Angband, so naturally 
I applied some of the results to Psiband as well. The result was the expanded
list of psionic monsters, including Master Psionicists, Master Illithids, and
Ilsenine, the Illithid God-Brain: and the first Psiband winner was posted - 
"Tar-Palantir the Wise", now immortalised in the game, just as is "Fundin 
Bluecloak", the name of the first recorded Angband winner many years ago, or 
"Evil Iggy" in Moria. A further bugfix version, called "1.0.7b", fixed 
three of the outstanding bugs - making monster AI optional rather than 
compulsory, and finally got Metapsionics working as it should do, and making 
Mind Wrack work properly for both player and monsters.

At this point, Aram Harrow found his time taken up much more with Real Life 
(TM) and was unable to devote much of his time to Psiband, so agreed to look
for a new maintainer. I volunteered to take care of the info.txt and help 
files myself, and the place of chief coder was taken by Matthias Kurzke:
this was shortly after the release of Angband 2.9.0, followed by Matthias's 
own ego-item patch which made ego-items more customizable. The original idea 
was to produce the first variant with 2.9.0 code and this ego-item patch as 
a base. However, that went by the wayside when the patch in question was 
adopted into vanilla itself, for 2.9.1, and then it was revealed that the 
code cleanup and update to 2.9.1 standards would take a lot longer than 
previously thought...

Since then, a lot of discussion has taken place. Code has been re-written. 
Bugs have been fixed, re-created, fixed again, until everyone is sick of it.
Two of the features formerly present in the game (Shadowform and Domination)
have been removed, but others added. Info.txt files have been tweaked and 
had new creatures, items, artifacts and vaults added. And if somebody asks 
who was responsible for a particularly nice idea, nobody's sure any more:
technically he's the coder and I'm the textfile person, but some of the ideas 
that have had to be hard-coded were mine in concept, and some of the new 
artifacts (particularly), monsters and items were Matthias's in design, as 
were most of the new artifact activations... Technically, the new version 
should be called Psiband 1.1.0, but as that would lead to confusion with 
the Psiband/ZAngband "PZiband" hybrid which is version 1.1.0, we've decided
to bump the version number up to 1.2.0 instead.

Psiband 1.3.0 brings the codebase up to vanilla 2.9.2. It fixes some bugs that
the cleanup introduced, and allows Rogues to set traps for monsters using a
rather complex system of "trapping kits". Probably it also brings lots of new
bugs that everyone is welcome to report...

HALF-GIANT
------------

Half-Giants are the cross between a human and a giant.
Like the Half-Ogres, the Half-Giants have great strength and
constitution, but even more so than half-ogres. However, their
very tall stature not only makes them easy to hit,
it also makes them very easy to spot, and gives them a penality
to their stealth.

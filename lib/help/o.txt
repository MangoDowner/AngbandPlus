NIBELUNG
----------

Nibelungs are the dark and evil cousins of the dwarves.
Very similar to dwarves in many ways, these more evil
inviduals fell into darkness, and thus resist darkness
attacks better than the normal dwarf. However, because
they are evil and their sense of leadership leaves much
to be desired, they have a penality to their charisma.

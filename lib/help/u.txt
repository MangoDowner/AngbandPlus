DEVLING
---------

Devlings are small, demonlike creatures, often considered as
minor demons. Unlike other demons however, Devlings are sociable
and civilised, and have a great sense of cooperation. Because
they are small and weak, one of their greatest survival technique
is to unite together, or with other creatures. Therefore, despite
looking like little demons, they have a good charisma. Devlings
have no wings, but they have a tail, red, black, green or purple
skin and very powerful legs. In fact, their agility and speed
are almost unmatched. They easily avoid blows, and very fast on
feets. Devlings also have the innate ability to turn into a small
rock, making them hardly visible, and allowing them to wait
until the foes are gone. Finally, they have an innate resistance
to fire.

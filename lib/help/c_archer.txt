#####R=== Archers ===

#####GDescription
Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class
around with any bow/xbow/sling. Needing a lot of ammo, they will learn 
early how to make it from junk found in the dungeons. They also gain at
level 20 the unique ability to make their arrows/bolts/shots ricochet 
off monsters!

Additionally, being more skilled with the use of their favored weapons,
they find that they can place their shots much better, resulting in less
broken and lost ammunition. Continued use of their bows results in them
gaining the ability to shoot faster and more powerfully as they advance
levels.

#####GPrimary Stats
Dexterity (for bow usage)

#####GMagic Usage
No magics.

Ammo can be made using the "m" command and selecting the archer abilities.
Shots can be made from rubble, arrows and bolts from skeletons and 
other such junk.

    a short bow
    a dagger

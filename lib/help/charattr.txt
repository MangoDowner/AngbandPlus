=== Character Attributes ===

During the process of Character Generation (see birth.txt [1]), you
will select your character's three primary attributes - its sex, race
and class. If you select a spellcasting class, you will also make a
choice of magic realms at that time. Your character will be randomly
assigned a number of other attributes such as height, weight, social
class, and background history

Your choices as to sex, race, class and realm are irrevocable and will
remain fixed for the entire life of that character. The only exception
to this, is that the Chaos spell 'Drink Logrus' (and the mutation 
Polymorph Self) may cause your race to change as one of its possible
effects.

In addition to these attributes, there are several statistics which are
used to determine your character's relative skills and abilities as
follows:


--- Primary Statistics ---

Each character has six primary statistics or 'stats'. These are
strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma,
which modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways. For
example, strength affects your carrying capacity, the amount of damage
you to a monster when you hit it and the number of blows per round you
get with a weapon. A more complete discussion of the primary statistics
is contained later in this document (see below [2]).

--- Experience ---

Experience affects almost everything else about your character. 
Experience can be gained as your character kills monsters, casts spells
or prayers for the first time, learns about an object kind by using it,
disarms traps and unlocks doors.  Certain classes may also gain
experience by destroying specific dungeon spell books and there are
potions in the dungeon that will boost your experience if you quaff
them.

When your character's experience crosses certain fixed boundaries, you
will attain a new experience level (up to a maximum of 50). When this
happens, your hitpoints, mana (if any), certain skills such as melee
fighting and bows and throws will all increase. Some races and classes
will also gain new powers and abilities when crossing certain
experience thresholds.

Deep down inside, the real objective of the game is to increase your
experience, and certain other characteristics, and also to collect
useful items, to give you a decent chance against the great Morgoth. 
Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus your
level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher
level. Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical
means, or by simply regaining the experience all over again.

--- Gold (AU) ---

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items and
services from the shops and other buildings on the town level. Gold
can be obtained by selling items to the shops, taking it from the
corpses of dead monsters, mining it and by finding it lying on the
dungeon floor.

Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is
based on the character's social class, charisma, sex (female
characters start with more gold), and other stats (less powerful
characters start with more gold). Each character also starts out
with a few useful items, which may be kept, or sold to a
shop-keeper for more gold.

--- Armor Class ---

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character
can avoid damage. Your armor class is affected by your dexterity and
your equipment. A more detailed discussion of Armor Class can be found
in the Combat section (see attack.txt#Armor [3]). 

--- Hit Points ---

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before he dies. Your hit points are derived
from your race, class, level, and constitution, and can be boosted
by magical means. Hit points may be regained by resting, or by a
variety of magical means.

--- Spell Points (Mana) ---

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many
spells (or prayers) a character can cast (or pray). Your spell
points (sometimes called mana) are derived from your class, level
and intelligence (for spells) or wisdom (for prayers). Spell points
may be regained by resting, or by a few magical means.

--- Resource Points (Junk) ---

Classes that are capable of making items collect resource points.
All they do is walk around the dungeon picking up things. They could
be bones, ores or other magical ingredients. These are used for things
similar to spells but they usually result in the creation of an item.
The amount you can carry depends on your intelligence and wisdom. But
beware, while they weigh nothing. If you exceed your carrying capacity
your maximum resource points will suffer.

--- Character Skills ---

Each character also has several primary skills: disarming, magic
devices, saving throws, stealth, searching, perception, melee and bows
and throws, which are derived from the character's race, class,
experience level, stats and their current equipment. These skills have
fairly obvious effects, but will be described more completely below.
The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and class.
Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with
the level of the character (see below for details [4]).

Each character may have one or more racially intrinsic skills and
racial abilities, which may also include special resistances and
activations.


***** <TheSexes>
=== Gender ===

You character may be male or female.  Males tend to be heavier but
there are no significant gameplay differences between the two sexes.


***** <TheRaces>
=== Races ===

There are thirty different races that you can choose from in Zangband.
Each race has various strengths and weaknesses and its own adjustments
to a character's stats and abilities. Many races also have intrinsic
abilities and powers.
 
Human
     The Human is the base character. All other races are compared
     to them. Humans can choose any class and are average at
     everything. Humans tend to go up levels faster than any other
     race because of their shorter life spans. No racial adjustments or
     intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.

Elf
     Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
     fighting. They tend to be smarter than either humans. Elves are 
     better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, bows, and 
     magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons. They resist 
     light effects intrinsically.
 
Halfling
     Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have
     good saving throws. They also are very good at searching,
     disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues
     (but prefer to be called burglars). They will be much weaker than
     humans, and no good at melee fighting. Halflings have fair
     infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a distance.
     They have their dexterity sustained. They are very fond of food,
     and learn, in due time, to cook a delicious meal from available
     ingredients.
 
Gnome
     Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than Halflings. They,
     like the Halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes
     make excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They are
     good at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They have
     lower strength than humans so they are not very good at fighting
     with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so they can
     detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Gnomes are protected
     intrinsically against paralysis and some slowing effects. At
     higher levels, Gnomes learn to teleport at will.
 
Dwarf
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. They
     tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent
     than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise,
     they resist spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have very
     good infra-vision because they live underground. They do have one
     big drawback, though. Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing
     in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason,
     screaming out challenges at imagined foes. In other words, dwarves
     have miserable stealth. They can never be blinded. Dwarves also
     learn to study the structure of a dungeon, and can spot things
     that go unseen by the other races.
 
Orc
     Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are
     terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and
     horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Orcs are,
     let's face it, ugly. They tend to pay more for goods in town.
     Orcs do make good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason
     that Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots of hit
     points. An Orc will learn to be fearless.
 
Stone Troll
     Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than
     most other races. They are also very stupid. They will
     make great warriors and iffy rogues. They are bad at searching,
     disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that a
     Orc grimaces in their presence. They also happen to be fun to
     run... trolls always have their strength sustained.

Swamp Troll
     Almost the same as their Stone Troll cousins, These Trolls are less
     strong but slightly more agile. Swamp Trolls regenerate wounds 
     very quickly and need lots of food to sustain themselves.

Ogre
     Ogres are like Orcs, only more so. They are big, bad,
     and stupid. For warriors, they have all the necessary attributes,
     and they can even become combat mages: after all, they are related 
     to Ogre Magi. Like Stone Trolls, they have their strength sustained 
     and at high levels their tough skin resists shards.

Yeek
     Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures. Fortunately, their
     horrible screams can scare away less confident foes, and their
     skin becomes more and more resistant to acid, as they gain
     experience. At very high levels their skin will drip acid that 
     burns enemies. But having said that, even a mediocre monster can 
     wipe the proverbial floor with an unwary Yeek.

Kobold
     Kobolds are a weak goblin race. They love poisoned weapons, and
     can learn to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry an
     unlimited supply). They are also inherently resistant to poison,
     and can become adequate fighters, although they are more suited 
     to rogue or cleric.

Dark Elf
     Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by darkness
     attacks, the Dark Elves have a long tradition and knowledge of
     magic. With their intelligence they can become superb mages or
     priests, and they can resist nether at a high level. 
     
Draconian
     A humanoid race with dragon blood. Proud and Noble just like a Dragon, 
     this powerful race has a tendency to hoard treasure. While they
     don't have scales, don't roar and their breathe weapon could be
     fought with a mint, they do have the ability to dominate other
     creatures with ease, at high levels.

Illithid
     (or Mind Flayer)
     A secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their civilization may
     well be older than any other on our planet, and their intelligence
     and wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so great that they
     enable Mind Flayers to become more powerful spellcasters than any
     other race, even if their physical attributes are a good deal less
     admirable. As they advance levels, they gain the powers of See
     Invisible and Telepathy.
 
Vampire
    One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an
    awe-inspiring sight. Yet this mighty creature has a serious
    weakness: the bright rays of sun are its bane, and it will need to
    flee the surface to the deep recesses of earth until the sun
    finally sets. Darkness, on the other hand, only makes the Vampire
    stronger and they are unharmed by darkness attacks. As undead, the
    Vampire has a firm hold on its life force, and resists nether
    attacks. The Vampire also resists cold and poison based attacks. It
    is, however, susceptible to its perpetual hunger for fresh blood,
    which can only be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby
    monster, which is the Vampire's special power. It should be noted
    that the vampires are so sensitive to daylight that even certain
    artifact light items which are filled with daylight will hurt them
    if they try to wield the items. Fortunately, the vampires do not
    really need these items, since they radiate an aura of 'dark light'
    of their own. Light resistance will, in any case, protect the
    vampire from the adverse effects of sunlight.

Fairy
    A powerful ethereal creature: the Fairy is a heavenly
    apparition, surrounded by an unearthly white glow. They exist only
    partially on our plane of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass
    through walls, although the density of the wall will hurt them in
    the process of doing this. As ethereal, they have a firm hold on their 
    life force, see invisible and can use their large butterfly wings to 
    fly. They also love light and resist light attacks. At higher levels
    they get faster.

Pixie
    One of the lesser fairy races, Pixies are very small. They have
    tiny wings, and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them.
    Although physically among the weakest races, Pixies
    are very talented in magic, and can become highly skilled wizards.
    Pixies have the special power of spraying Sleeping Dust, and at
    higher levels they learn to fly faster.

Kaoti
    This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos. They are
    a race of polymorphs that love chaos and do not control their morphing.
    All Kaoti are accustomed to Chaos so much that they learn to be 
    untroubled by confusion and chaos. Kaoti revel in chaos, as it twists
    them more and more. Kaoti are subject to mutations: when they
    have been created, they receive a random mutation. After that,
    every time they advance a level they have a little chance of
    gaining yet another mutation.

Saurian
    Saurian are a reptilian race that love Fire and Heat. They live near
    volcanoes or deserts. They have great temples to Fire and celebrate when 
    a Red Dragon comes to visit. They believe that Red Dragons are 
    supreme and all other Dragons are inferior. Their hard scales work
    as well as most armour and they resist fire easily. They make good
    honourable warriors but are no good as rogues. Unfortunately, since 
    they are cold blooded they should avoid cold attacks since they
    are slowed by cold.

Aquarian
    Aquarians are half-merman creatures that live near water. They are very
    wise but are a bit fragile out of water. They hate fire as it dries 
    them out. They resist cold but will not touch fire magic. Also due to
    their damp environments any machines they have rust, so they do not
    like technology.

Goblin
    Goblins do not live as far underground as Kobolds and they like 
    magic and technology more than poison. They are related to Orcs but are
    smaller and about as strong as a Human. They learn fast and they
    love gadgets which they learn to recharge. They make good mages but
    not so good clerics.

Minotaur
    Minotaur are half Human half Bull that love mazes and other puzzles. 
    They are very strong and never afraid. This makes them excellent warriors.
    They are not very wise but have no penalty to intelligence. Minotaur don't
    like other races that much and have to pay more in shops. Minotaur have 
    horns on their head that they use as a deadly weapon.

Centaur
    Centaur are half Humanoid half Horse. They start faster than other 
    races and are very wise. They worship Order and learn to resist 
    Confusion and Nexus attacks. They learn slowly and are not very agile 
    due to their size. They are excellent clerics and lousy rogues.

Catling
   Catlings are humanoid cats that are extremely agile and get faster as
   they get experience. They enjoy games and love to play with their enemies. 
   They are not very wise and have a slightly weak health. They make 
   excellent rogues but not very good clerics.

Dryad
   A Dryad is a tree spirit that is smart and very beautiful. They are not
   very agile and should not be rogues. They can learn to see invisible and 
   to cure wounds. Being very natural creatures they have a dislike of
   anything to do with technology.

Faun
   (or Satyr)
   Fauns have goat legs and horns and like their god, they love nature.
   They are good natured creatures that can control dreams.
   Always happy for a reason to party, Fauns love music and celebration
   more than anybody else.

Ent
   Ents are large moving trees. They are very similar to Dryads and 
   they live for a long time. Ents are very slow learners because they 
   like to think things over more than "hasty folk". They resist poison
   and have their constition sustained. They gain the ability to regrow 
   themselves when they get a bit beaten up.

Drider
   Drider are a hybrid of Dark Elves and Spiders. They are the bane of 
   unwary adventurers that travel underground. They are strong and agile
   but slow learners. They resist dark and can see in the dark.
   Their dexterity is sustained.

Uruk-Hai
   Uruk-Hai are the largest of the Orcish races. They live only for war 
   and have the best combat skill in the game but learn very slowly. They 
   resist dark and have their strength and toughness sustained.

Ratling
   Ratling are humanoid shaped Rats, hunted by Catlings and mistaken for wererats. 
   They are agile, good learners and very cheerful. They do not smell bad and
   are very conscious of good hygiene.

Leprechaun
   These little Fey are agile, smart and really *like* gold. But they are not
   greedy about it. They are physically weak and should avoid close combat.
   They work well with any magic and enjoy telling jokes.

Perthoron
   Perthoron is Eldarin for Half Eagle. These noble creatures dislike evil. They 
   can fly and get faster as they get levels. Ever vigilant, they are great at
   spotting hidden things.

Shadow
   Another Undead race. Theses shades of their formar life are very insubstantial
   and similar to fairies. They cannot walk through walls though, they only 
   recieve half damage from any attack, except Nether of which they are made, as 
   this heals them. Being undead they are resistant to cold and poison but they 
   are weak of physical strength.

Wolfman
   Half Human, Half Wolf, 100 percent vicious. Stronger and more agile than the 
   average human, these fearsome predators can be horrifying to fight against.
   They are a bit low on wisdom and charisma. And although they are low on 
   constitution they have high hitpoints.



***** <TheClasses>
=== Classes ===
 
There are about thirty different classes that you can choose from 
in STangband. But you may notice some are very simmilar. Each class
has various strengths and weaknesses and its own adjustments to a 
character's stats and abilities. Many classes also have intrinsic 
abilities and powers. These are often linked to the character's 
experience level and only become available later in the game.
These abilities are activated with the "y" key.
Most classes can be summed up by a combination of 2 basic class types.

 
--- The Classes ---


Warrior Type:   Warrior/Berserker/Ninja/Blacksmith
    A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his
    problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back
    on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many high-level
    devices may be forever beyond their use.

    A warrior's prime statistics are his or her Strength, Dexterity and
    Constitution. A Warrior will be good at Fighting and Throwing/Bows,
    but bad at most other skills. Warriors cannot learn magic and gain
    experience for destroying high level spellbooks. With the exception
    of the Warrior Mage, who has a talent for fighting and magic.

    As a warrior's experience increases, he becomes more proficient
    with his weapons gaining an additional attack per round with his
    missile weapon. As his skill improves, a warrior will become more
    confident in his ability to defeat his opponents and eventually
    will become resistant to fear attacks.

    Warriors know the usefulness of good training and should their
    body get out of shape while adventuring they will learn the Training
    ability to restore their physical stats quickly.
    Berserkers will eventually master the Berserk state but while they
    are still learning they can use it in small bursts.
    If a warrior gets surrounded by monsters than the monsters better duck,
    the Spin Attack ability gives a warrior a quick burst of speed to 
    attack all nearby monsters.

Mage Type:   (Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Thief/Warrior/Tech) Mage/Wizard
    A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot
    hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. In
    addition to his spellbooks, a mage should carry a range of magical
    devices to help him in his endeavors which he can master far more
    easily than anyone else. A mage is also better able to resist the
    effects of spells cast at him by his enemies.

    A mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his
    spell casting ability. Good Wisdom and Dexterity also help. There
    is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but
    spells are the mage's true strength. With two notable exceptions,
    mages should avoid wearing armor on their hands as this can
    restrict their spell casting ability. 

    Most Mage type characters get to chose any realm they wish unless
    it clashes with their fixed realm.
    As their knowledge of magic increses, mages get the ability to Focus
    nearby magic to replenish their spell points.
    At later levels they will learn to detect magical items.

Cleric Type:   Driud/Necromancer/Priest/Shaman/Sage/Tech Cleric
    A Cleric is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They
    explore the dungeon in the service of their God and if treasure
    just happens to fall into their packs, well, so much more to the
    glory of their religion. A Cleric's primary stat is Wisdom since
    this determine his success at praying to his deity. Since Clerics
    receive new prayers as gifts from their patron deity, they cannot
    choose which ones they will learn. Clerics are familiar with
    magical devices which they believe act as foci for divine
    intervention in the natural order of things, but are not as good as
    a mage in their use.

    Clerics are good at resisting spells cast at them and make decent
    fighters but prefer blunt weapons over edged ones. A priest
    wielding an edged weapon will be so uncomfortable with it that his
    fighting ability will be affected unless it has first been blessed
    by the Gods. High level clerics who practice Life magic will learn
    to invoke the power of their patron deity to bless such weapons.

    The Cleric realms in STangband are Life, Death, Order and Chaos.
    Each of these has there own kind of Cleric. A Druid serves Life and
    will strive to ensure that good pravails. A Necromancer follows Death
    and Death follows them. A Priest stands for Truth and Justice. While
    a Shaman works for Chaos and will recieve random "gifts" from there
    Spirit Patron. A Sage searches for knowledge and receives the
    Wizardry realm.

    A Priest will learn the Turn Undead ability to assist in destroying
    their corrupted form of living.
    A Necromancer will get access to a powerful spell that does not 
    require spell points. Blood Fire uses their own blood instead.
    High level Shamans can Tear Reality apart to let the Chaos flow 
    freely but it can be dangerous to do.

Rogue Type:   Rogue/Assassin/Ninja/Thief Mage/Tech Thief
    A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is
    capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. Rogues are good at
    locating hidden traps and doors and are the masters of disarming
    traps and picking locks. A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to
    sneak around many creatures without having to fight, or to get in a
    telling first blow. A rogue may also backstab a fleeing monster.

    A rogue is better than a warrior or paladin with magical devices,
    but still cannot rely on their performance. Rogues can also learn a
    few spells from the Astral realm, but not the powerful offensive 
    spells magi can use. Unless they are a Thief Mage. A rogue's primary 
    statistics are Intelligence and Dexterity but Strength and Constitution
    are important too.

    As a rogue increases in experience, his proficiency with the sling
    improves and he will ultimately gain two additional shots per round
    with his favorite missile launcher. They also improve their senses to
    the point where they can detect invisible monsters (but while they are
    still learning this their imagination could interfere). Later they 
    learn enough about the arts of invisibility to cast the spell themselves.

Tech Type:   Technician/Blacksmith/Tech Mage/Tech Cleric/Tech Thief
    Tech type characters specialise in the making of items. They are good
    at using all devices and are the best at using machines. Their primary
    stat is intelligence which is checked to use their unique abilities.
    These abilities require to user to collect and carry special materials
    with which they can make things like potions and weapons.

    A high intelligence and wisdom will increase the quality and amount of
    resources they can collect. Resource points do not regenerate as fast
    as mana and do not regenerate while you rest. Even though they get a
    special magic missile type ability early in the game which cannot be
    affected by magic resistance they will need other ways of defending
    themselves.

    As they gain levels the things they can make and do with their resources
    increases giving them a few attack abilities, the ability to make their
    own weapons and potions. Unfortunatly due to their quality these will
    not sell well in shops.

Cleric Warrior Type:   Paladin/Chaos Warrior/Ranger/Dark Knight
    These are the fighters who defend the religion with more force than
    others. Since they still worship their gods and to get prayers they will
    need a high wisdom. Their other primary stat is strength with the
    exception to Rangers who prefer missile weapons and may prefer dexterity.

    Rangers live with the land and worship Life. They prefer to use a bow
    for fighting but can use other weapons when necessary. Since they use
    missile weapons they can make their own missiles using things they
    find in the dungeon.

    Paladins are warriors of truth and worship Order. They are good with
    armour and a sword but lack in other skills. Paladins fight for justice
    and learn to be completely fearless. They can learn the Healing touch.

    Dark Knights enjoy spilling the blood of whoever gets in their way.
    They worship Death and are almost as good as a Warrior at fighting
    though they are not very good with missiles. They learn to resist fear
    at the same time as Warriors. Like Necromancers they can use Blood Fire.

    Chaos Warriors fight for the spirits of chaos and are slightly better
    at using missile weapons than Paladins. Chaos Warriors get gifts from
    their spirit, like Shamans and learn to resist chaos. They to can
    Tear Reality but it is still dangerous for them.

    Cleric Warriors have no respect for the magic of the opposite type and
    gain experience for destroying books of the opposite realm.

Warrior-Mage:
    A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between
    the warrior and mage classes. As warriors they are much superior to 
    the usual Mage class. But do not gain fear resistance.

    The Warrior-Mage is recommended for the players who want to cast
    spells but whose mages tend to die too quickly. However, the power
    does not come without a price as Warrior-Mages require more
    experience to advance levels than any other class.

    When Warrior-mages begin the game they can freely select any mage 
    realm of magic. Although they do not gain new spells as fast as regular
    mages, they will eventually learn every spell in their realm, thus
    making a very competitive choice for players who have not learnt to
    use magic effectively.

Monk:
    The Monk character class is very different from all other classes.
    Although they can use weapons and armor just like any other class,
    their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with
    no armor or weapons. To gain the resistances necessary for
    survival at higher levels a monk may need to wear some kind of
    armor, but if the armor he wears is too heavy, it will severely
    disturb his martial arts maneuvers. 

    As a monk gains in experience he learns, new, powerful forms of
    attack and is able to land more blows per round. His defensive
    capabilities increase likewise. Fortunately, the amount of armor a
    monk can wear, while still fighting efficiently, also increases
    with experience.

    In addition, the monk's agility allows him to resist paralyzing
    attacks once he reaches a high enough level (but only if his armor
    is not restricting his movement). Monk's are able to move quickly
    and will become faster and be able to strike more quickly as they
    gain experience.

    Monks use magic through meditaion giving a similar effect to the
    cleric. They need wisdom to use their magic which is every spell
    in the Astral realm. They also gain a couple of useful abilities.

Mindcrafter:
    The Mindcrafter is a unique class that uses the powers of the mind
    instead of magic. These powers are unique to Mindcrafters, and vary
    from simple extrasensory powers to mental domination of others.
    Since these powers are developed by the practice of certain
    disciplines, a Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use them. The
    available powers are simply determined by the character's level.

    A Mindcrafter's primary stat is Wisdom since this is used to
    determine how well he / she can perform the psychic powers, and in
    combat a Mindcrafter is roughly the equivalent of a priest. Unlike
    the priest, however, a Mindcrafter is never penalized for wielding
    an edged weapon.

    Although the powers of a Mindcrafter may seem like magic, this is
    not strictly speaking the case. They are mental powers, independent
    of the ordinary sources of magic. Consequently, Mindcrafters are
    not interested in 'magic' and learn no spells or prayers.

    As a Mindcrafter's experience increases, so does his ability to
    control his body with his mind as do his mental powers. A
    mindcrafter will learn to control his fear early in his career and
    to resist becoming confused at higher levels. His practice of
    mental discipline will mean that eventually his wisdom will be
    sustained. Very experienced mindcrafters will gain the power of
    telepathy.

Archer:
    An Archer is a Warrior that specialises in the use of missile weapons
    which they use better than anyone else. There primary stats are
    strength and dexterity but they may need constition as well.
    Like a Ranger they can make missiles from things they find round
    the dungeon.

Witch:
    A Witch will get the job done without all the ego involved with wizards.
    Witchs prefer more subtle magic and therefore only learn the Astral
    realm, though they learn it very well. They can also use dungeon
    materials to make potions and recharge items.
    Their primary stats are intelligence and wisdom but they can be hard
    keep alive.

High Mage:
    High mages are mages who specialize in one particular field of
    magic and learn it very well - much better than the ordinary mage.
    For the price of giving up a second realm of magic, they gain
    substantial benefits in the mana costs, minimum levels, and failure
    rates in the spells of the realm of their specialty.

    A high mage's prime statistic is intelligence as this determines
    his spell casting ability. Good wisdom and dexterity also help.
    There is no rule that says a high mage cannot become a good
    fighter, but spells are the mage's true strength. With two notable
    exceptions, high mages should avoid wearing armor on their hands as
    this can restrict their spell casting ability.

    High mages may freely choose any realm and will learn it better 
    than any other realm but they should carry a large amount of 
    magical items in case they discover their spells are not effective.
 

***** <PrimaryStats>
=== Primary Statistcs ===

Each character has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the abilities of
the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value,
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of about 40.
The average is about 14 but primary stats will be about 18.

--- The Primary Statistics ---

Strength
     Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee combat and
     with missile weapons. A high strength will improve your chances of
     getting multiple blows with your melee weapon and, in addition,
     will dramatically increase the amount of damage done with each
     hit. Strength also has a marginal effect on your chance to hit
     your opponent. Characters with low strength may receive penalties.
     Strength is also useful in tunneling, bashing and in carrying
     heavy items without being slowed down.
 
Intelligence
     Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like
     spellcasters (high mages, mages, warrior-mages and witchs). 
     Intelligence will affect the number of spells these classes may 
     learn each level, the number of spell points they receive and 
     their spell fail rates. These classes cannot learn spells if their
     intelligence is 7 or lower. Also, intelligent characters are better
     at using magic devices, picking locks and disarming traps.
     Intelligence is also used for tech abilities just like it is 
     used for magic.
 
Wisdom
     Wisdom affects the ability of priest-like spellcasters (clerics,
     paladins and monks) to use prayers. Wisdom will affect the number
     of spells these classes may learn each level, the number of spell
     points they receive and their spell fail rates. In addition, 
     wisdom is also used to determine a mindcrafter's ability to use
     his or her mental powers. These classes cannot learn spells if
     their wisdom is 7 or lower. Wise character's will have better
     chances of resisting magical spells cast upon them by monsters.
     Wisdom also increases your maximum resource points.
 
Dexterity
     Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high
     dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter
     weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and will increase
     his chances of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from
     enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming
     traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
     inhabit the dungeons.
 
Constitution
     Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
     body, and to recover from damage received. Therefore a character
     with a high constitution will receive more hit points and also
     recover them faster while resting.

Charisma
     Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
     appearance. A character with a high charisma will receive better
     prices from store owners, whereas a character with a very low
     charisma may be robbed blind. A high charisma will also mean more
     starting money for the character. Charisma is also used when
     calculating the success of a mindcrafter at dominating a monster.
 

***** <PrimarySkills>
=== Primary Skills ===

Characters possess some different abilities which can help them to
survive. The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and
class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase
with the level of the character with the rate of increase dependent
upon the level of the character.
 
Melee
     Melee is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
     Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but if
     his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive more
     blows per round with lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both
     modify the ability to hit an opponent. This skill increases with
     the level of the character.
 
Bows and Throws
     Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in
     this skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this
     ability may modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the
     amount of damage done, and the ability to hit a creature. This
     skill increases with the level of the character.
 
Saving Throws
     A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects
     of a spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not
     include spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as
     quaffing a nasty potion. This ability increases with the level of
     the character, but then most high level creatures are better at
     casting spells, so it tends to even out. A high wisdom also
     increases this ability.
 
Stealth
     The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with
     good stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the
     first blow. Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy
     character entirely, allowing a player to avoid certain fights.
     This skill is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
     improve unless magically enhanced.
 
Disarming
     Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and includes
     picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain
     the character some experience. A trap must be found before it can
     be disarmed. Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to
     disarm, and this ability increases with the level of the
     character.
 
Magical Devices
     Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience
     and knowledge. Spell users such as magi and priests are therefore
     much better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This
     skill is modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of
     the character.
 
Perception (Searching Frequency)
     Perception is the ability to notice something without actively
     seeking it out. This skill is based entirely upon race and class,
     and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
Searching (Searching Ability)
     To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps, and
     traps on chests. Rogues are the best at searching, but magi,
     rangers, and priests are also good at it. This skill is based
     entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless
     magically enhanced.

Infra-vision
     Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the
     dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the player to
     see walls and objects. Infra-vision will allow a character to see
     any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain distance. This ability
     works equally well with or with out a light source. The majority
     of STAngband's creatures are cold-blooded, and will not be detected
     unless lit up by a light source. Most non human races have innate
     infra-vision ability. Human can gain infra-vision only if it is
     magically enhanced.

Each of the races and classes has certain modifications to their
starting statistics an experience penalty. The experience penalty is
designed to 'balance' the races with better starting statistics and
abilities by requiring them to earn more experience before advancing a

=== Character Attributes ===

During the process of Character Generation (see birth.txt [1]), you
will select your character's three primary attributes - its sex, race
and class. If you select a spellcasting class, you will also make a
choice of magic realms at that time. Your character will be randomly
assigned a number of other attributes such as height, weight, social
class, and character background.

Your choices as to sex, race, class and realm are irrevocable and will
remain fixed for the entire life of that character. The only exception
to this, is that the Chaos spell 'Polymorh Self' (and the mutation of
the same name) may cause your race to change as one of its possible
effects.

In addition to these attributes, there are several statistics which are
used to determine your character's relative skills and abilities as
follows:


--- Primary Statistics ---

Each character has six primary statistics or 'stats'. These are
strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma,
which modify the abilities of the character in a variety of ways. For
example, strength affects your carrying capacity, the amount of damage
you to a monster when you hit it and the number of blows per round you
get with a weapon. A more complete discussion of the primary statistics
is contained later in this document (see below [2]).

--- Experience ---

Experience affects almost everything else about your character. 
Experience can be gained as your character kills monsters, casts spells
or prays for the first time, learns about an object kind by using it,
disarms traps and unlocks doors.  Certain classes may also gain
experience by destroying specific dungeon spell books and there are
potions in the dungeon that will boost your experience if you quaff
them.

When your character's experience crosses certain fixed boundaries, you
will attain a new experience level (up to a maximum of 50). When this
happens, your hitpoints, mana (if any), certain skills such as melee
fighting and bows and throws will all increase. Some races and classes
will also gain new powers and abilities when crossing certain
experience threshholds.

Deep down inside, the real objective of the game is to increase your
experience, and certain other characteristics, and also to collect
useful items, to give you a decent chance against the great Serpent of
Chaos. Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus your
level, which will cause you to lose all of the effects of the higher
level. Luckily, you can restore drained experience through magical
means, or by simply regaining the experience all over again.

--- Gold (AU) ---

Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items and
services from the shops and other buildings on the town level. Gold
can be obtained by selling items to the shops, taking it from the
corpses of dead monsters, mining it and by finding it lying on the
dungeon floor.

Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is
based on the character's social class, charisma, sex (female
characters start with more gold), and other stats (less powerful
characters start with more gold). Each character also starts out
with a few useful items, which may be kept, or sold to a
shop-keeper for more gold.

--- Armor Class ---

Each character has an armor class, representing how well the character
can avoid damage. Your armor class is affected by your dexterity and
your equipment. A more detailed discussion of Armor Class can be found
in the Combat section (see attack.txt#Armor [3]). 

--- Hit Points ---

Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before he dies. Your hit points are derived
from your race, class, level, and constitution, and can be boosted
by magical means. Hit points may be regained by resting, or by a
variety of magical means.

--- Spell Points (Mana) ---

Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how many
spells (or prayers) a character can cast (or pray). Your spell
points (sometimes called mana) are derived from your class, level
and intelligence (for spells) or wisdom (for prayers). Spell points
may be regained by resting, or by a few magical means.

--- Character Skills ---

Each character also has several primary skills: disarming, magic
devices, saving throws, stealth, searching, perception, melee and bows
and throws, which are derived from the character's race, class,
experience level, stats and their current equipment. These skills have
fairly obvious effects, but will be described more completely below.
The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and class.
Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with
the level of the character (see below for details [4]).

Each character may have one or more racially intrinsic skills and
racial abilities, which may also include special resistances and
activations.


***** <TheRaces>
=== Races ===

There are fifteen different races that you can choose from in XAngband.
Each race has various strengths and weaknesses and its own adjustments
to a character's stats and abilities. Many races also have intrinsic
abilities and powers.
 
Human
     The human is the base character. All other races are compared
     to them. Humans can choose any class and are average at
     everything. Humans tend to go up levels faster than any other
     race because of their shorter life spans. No racial adjustments or
     intrinsics occur to characters choosing human.

Half-Elf
     Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human, but not as
     strong. Half-elves are slightly better at searching, disarming,
     saving throws, stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good
     at hand weapons. Half-elves may choose any class and do not
     receive any intrinsic abilities.

Elf
     Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at
     fighting. They tend to be smarter than either humans or half-elves
     and also have better wisdom. Elves are better at searching,
     disarming, perception, stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not
     as good at hand weapons. They resist light effects intrinsically.
 
Hobbit
     Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have
     good saving throws. They also are very good at searching,
     disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues
     (but prefer to be called burglars). They will be much weaker than
     humans, and no good at melee fighting. Halflings have fair
     infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a distance.
     They have their dexterity sustained. They are very fond of food,
     and learn, in due time, to cook a delicious meal from available
     ingredients.
 
Gnome
     Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than Halflings. They,
     like the Halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes
     make excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They are
     good at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They have
     lower strength than humans so they are not very good at fighting
     with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so they can
     detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Gnomes are protected
     intrinsically against paralysis and some slowing effects. At
     higher levels, Gnomes learn to teleport at will.
 
Dwarf
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. They
     tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent
     than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise,
     they resist spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have very
     good infra-vision because they live underground. They do have one
     big drawback, though. Dwarves are loudmouthed and proud, singing
     in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason,
     screaming out challenges at imagined foes. In other words, dwarves
     have miserable stealth. They can never be blinded. Dwarves also
     learn to study the structure of a dungeon, and can spot things
     that go unseen by the other races.
 
Half-Orc
     Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are
     terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and
     horrible at searching, disarming, and perception. Half-Orcs are,
     let's face it, ugly. They tend to pay more for goods in town.
     Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason
     that Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots of hit
     points. Because of their preference to living underground to on
     the surface, Half-Orcs resist darkness attacks. A Half-Orc will
     learn to dispel any fear that may be upon him or her.
 
Half-Troll
     Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than
     most other races. They are also very stupid and slow. They will
     make great warriors and iffy priests. They are bad at searching,
     disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that a
     Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. They also happen to be fun to
     run... Half-trolls always have their strength sustained. At higher
     levels, Half-Trolls learn to enter a berserk fury, and regenerate
     wounds automatically.

Dunadan
    Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race
    surpasses human abilities in every field, especially constitution.
    However, being men of the world, very little is new to them, and
    levels are very hard for them to gain.  Their constitution cannot
    be reduced and they heal fast.

High-Elf
     High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning
     of time. They are masters of all skills, and are strong and
     intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes suspect. They can
     play most classes very well. High-elves begin their lives able to
     see the unseen, and resist light effects just like regular elves.
     However, there are few things that they have not seen already, and
     experience is very hard for them to gain.

Half-Giant
     Half-Giants are not too unusual, as there has been a tradition
     according to which it is a noble and brave thing to do to consort
     a giant (especially a giant-maid). Nevertheless, the poor
     offspring of such a union is seldom very popular in the world of
     men. Their limited intelligence makes it difficult for them to
     become full spellcasters, but with their huge strength they make
     excellent warriors. No ordinary wall can withstand the fury of a
     giant, or a half-giant, and at higher levels they can learn the
     power of magical digging. Their thick skin makes them resistant to
     shards, and like Half-Ogres and Half-Trolls, they have their
     strength sustained.

Klackon
     Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid
     creatures. They make great fighters, but their mental abilities
     are severely limited. Obedient and well-ordered, they can never be
     confused. They are also very nimble, and become faster as they
     advance levels. They are also very acidic, inherently resisting
     acid, and capable of spitting acid at higher levels.

Kobold
     Kobolds are a weak goblin race. They love poisoned weapons, and
     can learn to throw poisoned darts (of which they carry an
     unlimited supply). They are also inherently resistant to poison,
     and can become adequate fighters, although they are not one of the
     more powerful races.

Nibelung
     The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these
     cave-dwellers are not much bothered by darkness. Their natural
     inclination to magical items has made them immune to effects which
     could drain away magical energy, and like ordinary dwarves, they
     can examine the dungeon to discover traps and secret doors.

Mind Flayer
     A secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their civilization may
     well be older than any other on our planet, and their intelligence
     and wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so great that they
     enable Mind Flayers to become more powerful spellcasters than any
     other race, even if their physical attributes are a good deal less
     admirable. As they advance levels, they gain the powers of See
     Invisible, Telepathy and a mind blast attack.

***** <TheClasses>
=== Classes ===
 
There are thirteen different classes that you can choose from in
XAngband. Each class has various strengths and weaknesses and its own
adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. Many classes also
have intrinsic abilities and powers. These are often linked to the
character's experience level and only become available later in the
game.
 
--- The Classes ---

Warrior
    A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his
    problems by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back
    on the help of a magical device. Unfortunately, many high-level
    devices may be forever beyond their use.

    A warrior's prime statistics are his or her Strength, Dexterity and
    Constitution. A Warrior will be good at Fighting and Throwing/Bows,
    but bad at most other skills. Warriors cannot learn magic and gain
    experience for destroying high level spellbooks.

    As a warrior's experience increases, he becomes more proficient
    with his weapons gaining an additional attack per round with his
    missile weapon. As his skill improves, a warrior will become more
    confident in his ability to defeat his opponents and eventually
    will become resistant to fear attacks.

Mage
    A Mage is a spell caster that must live by his wits as he cannot
    hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon like a warrior. In
    addition to his spellbooks, a mage should carry a range of magical
    devices to help him in his endeavors which he can master far more
    easily than anyone else. A mage is also better able to resist the
    effects of spells cast at him by his enemies.

    A mage's prime statistic is Intelligence as this determines his
    spell casting ability. Good Wisdom and Dexterity also help. There
    is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but
    spells are the mage's true strength. With two notable exceptions,
    mages should avoid wearing armor on their hands as this can
    restrict their spell casting ability. 

    Mages can freely choose between the magic and sorcery magic realms.

Priest
    A Priest is a character devoted to serving a higher power. They
    explore the dungeon in the service of their God and if treasure
    just happens to fall into their packs, well, so much more to the
    glory of their religion. A Priest's primary stat is Wisdom since
    this determine his success at praying to his deity. Since Priests
    receive new prayers as gifts from their patron deity, they cannot
    choose which ones they will learn. Priests are familiar with
    magical devices which they believe act as foci for divine
    intervention in the natural order of things, but are not as good as
    a mage in their use.

    Priests are good at resisting spells cast at them and make decent
    fighters but prefer blunt weapons over edged ones. A priest
    wielding an edged weapon will be so uncomfortable with it that his
    fighting ability will be affected unless it has first been blessed
    by the Gods. High level priests who practice Life magic will learn
    to invoke the power of their patron deity to bless such weapons.

    The priests in XAngband have Life magic as their primary realm.
    Primarily concerned with healing and defence, although also 
    powerful for attacks against evil.

Ranger
    A Ranger is a combination of a warrior and a mage who has developed
    a special affinity for the natural world around him. He is a good
    fighter and the best of the classes with a missile weapon such as
    a bow. A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good
    searching, a good saving throw and is good with magical devices.

    A Ranger's primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity since these
    affect his spell casting ability and his ability with his bow but,
    as a fighter, Strength and Constitution are important too. As a
    ranger's experience increases, so does his skill with his primary
    weapon - the bow and he will learn to notch and loose arrows very
    quickly. His ability with a cross bow will similarly increase but
    not to the same extent. Unfortunately, because a ranger is really a
    dual class character, more experience is required for him to
    advance through the levels.

    Rangers may chose between the realms of Life and Combat, the 
    latter being best suited for improving performance in fights.

Paladin
    A Paladin is a combination of a warrior and a priest. Paladins are
    very good fighters, second only to the warrior class, but not very
    good at missile weapons. A paladin lacks much in the way of
    abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and
    magical devices but has a decent saving throw due to his divine
    alliance.

    A paladin's primary stats are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and
    Wisdom since he must both fight and pray for divine intervention.
    The paladin receives prayers at a slower pace then the priest, but
    can receive even the most powerful prayers although at a higher
    cost and fail rate. s.

    Like priests, paladins are trained in Life magic. A paladin will 
    gain experience for destroying high-level spellbooks from all the 
    magic realms except Life. 

    As a Paladin gains in experience he will become more confident in
    his abilities to defeat his enemies and in his deity's power to
    protect him. As a result, Paladins become resistant to fear at
    higher levels.

Warrior-Mage
    A Warrior-Mage is precisely what the name suggests: a cross between
    the warrior and mage classes. While their brothers, the rangers,
    specialize in Life magic and survival skills, true Warrior-Mages
    attempt to reach the best of both worlds. As warriors they are much
    superior to the usual Mage class.

    The Warrior-Mage is recommended for the players who want to cast
    spells but whose mages tend to die too quickly. However, the power
    does not come without a price as Warrior-Mages require more
    experience to advance levels than any other class.

    Warrior-mages begin the game with Sorcery or Combat magic. They do 
    not gain new spells as fast as regular mages, but they will 
    eventually learn every spell in their realm.

Mindcrafter
    The Mindcrafter is a unique class that uses the powers of the mind
    instead of magic. These powers are unique to Mindcrafters, and vary
    from simple extrasensory powers to mental domination of others.
    Since these powers are developed by the practice of certain
    disciplines, a Mindcrafter requires no spellbooks to use them. The
    available powers are simply determined by the character's level.

    A Mindcrafter's primary stat is Wisdom since this is used to
    determine how well he / she can perform the psychic powers, and in
    combat a Mindcrafter is roughly the equivalent of a priest. Unlike
    the priest, however, a Mindcrafter is never penalized for wielding
    an edged weapon.

    Although the powers of a Mindcrafter may seem like magic, this is
    not strictly speaking the case. They are mental powers, independent
    of the ordinary sources of magic. Consequently, Mindcrafters are
    not interested in 'magic' and learn no spells or prayers.

    As a Mindcrafter's experience increases, so does his ability to
    control his body with his mind as do his mental powers. A
    mindcrafter will learn to control his fear early in his career and
    to resist becoming confused at higher levels. His practice of
    mental discipline will mean that eventually his wisdom will be
    sustained. Very experienced mindcrafters will gain the power of
    telepathy.

Archer
    Archers are experts in missile attacks, and far surpass rangers
    in that ability.  However they cannot cast spells, nor can they 
    easily use magic items.  Archers spend such attention on their 
    marksmanship that they are not good at hand-to-hand combat.

    The principle abilities of archers are strength, dexterity and
    constitution.  They have a natural skill with firing arrows fast
    that increases as their experience grows.

Archaeologist
    Archaeologist is not a very strong class.  However, due to their
    class, they excell in using digging implements and in pseudo-id.
    They use Sorcery for its utility, but it not being their primary
    area it's not as if they are able to use all Sorcery spells.
    Because an archaeologist pursues his research without fear of 
    curse his magic defense is strong.

    The principle abilities of an archaeologist is strength, dexterity
    and constitution.  Also intelligence is essential to pursue 
    Sorcery. With increasing level an archaeologist will gain 
    confidence in wielding digging implements and be able to strike 
    more blows with them.

Elementalist
    Elementalist is a class strong in handling elemental powers.  They 
    use one of the eight elements.  As they concentrate, then relase, 
    elemental energy their spells are generally offensive. They don't 
    need spellbooks to work their magic.  

    As they increase in experience they become resistant to then immune
    to the element they specialize in.  Finally they can use class 
    powers that relate to their element.  Doubtless adventure will 
    become a cake walk if they use these well.

    The elemental realms are Fire, Ice, Sky, Sea, Dark, Chaos, Earth 
    and Death.

Sniper
    Snipers are specialists in marksmanship, but not like archers who 
    fire off arrow after arrow in swift succession.  They don't just
    increase accuracy and power of shots by concentration, they can use
    fearsome archery techniques.  

    What they require is powerful bows or crossbows, good quality 
    ammunition and the fortitude to bear up without flinching under 
    any situation.  

    Snipers know their enemies well and can shoot them from the shadows.
    They have no time for magic.

Snatcher
    Snatchers are a class with a scary special ability.  They possess 
    a strong soul and are able to move it itself to take over another
    body. In possessing another being their original body returns to the
    soil and the soul of the being they've taken over is destroyed.
 
    As they increase in level they find it easier to take over stronger 
    monsters. Depending on the body in question usable equipment may be 
    limited but they will be able to use the strong attacking magics and 
    breath attacks of the monster they possessed.

Artificer
    Artificers are expert at using magic items.  They don't have strong
    bodies or convenient magic at their call, but are able to use tools
    quickly, well and accurately. They are able to use the energy of, 
    for example oil flasks, to recharge items.
	  	 
    That said the magic items you can get hold of in town are limited so 
    the key to victory becomes whether you can pick up powerful tools or
    not.


***** <PrimaryStats>
=== Primary Statistcs ===

Each character has six primary "stats", strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma, which modify the abilities of
the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value,
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even
higher, into the "percentile" range, represented as  "18/01" through
"18/100". Actually, every stat can be raised even above 18/100 by
magical means, up to a pure maximum of 18/220, which is represented as
"18/***".

Traditionally, a percentile stat such as "18/50" has been thought of as
representing a value part way between 18 and 19, and this is one way to
think of them. However, often, the best way to view the "bonus" values
after the "18/" is as "tenth" points, since it often takes the same
magic to raise a stat from, say, 4 to 5, or 16 to 17, as it does from,
say, 18/40 to 18/50. The important thing to remember is that almost all
internal calculations "ignore" the final digit of any "bonus", so that,
for example, "18/40" and "18/49" have the same effects.

--- The Primary Statistics ---

Strength
     Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee combat and
     with missile weapons. A high strength will improve your chances of
     getting multiple blows with your melee weapon and, in addition,
     will dramatically increase the amount of damage done with each
     hit. Strength also has a marginal effect on your chance to hit
     your opponent. Characters with low strength may receive penalties.
     Strength is also useful in tunneling, bashing and in carrying
     heavy items without being slowed down.
 
Intelligence
     Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like
     spellcasters (high mages, mages, warrior-mages, rangers, chaos
     warriors and rogues). Intelligence will affect the number of
     spells these classes may learn each level, the number of spell
     points they receive and their spell fail rates. These classes
     cannot learn spells if their intelligence is 7 or lower. Also,
     intelligent characters are better at using magic devices, picking
     locks and disarming traps.
 
Wisdom
     Wisdom affects the ability of priest-like spellcasters (priests,
     paladins and monks) to use prayers. WIS will affect the number of
     spells these classes may learn each level, the number of spell
     points they receive and their spell fail rates. In addition, WIS
     is also used to determine a mindcrafter's ability to use his or
     her mental powers. These classes cannot learn spells if their
     wisdom is 7 or lower. Wise character's will have better chances of
     resisting magical spells cast upon them by monsters.
 
Dexterity
     Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high
     dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter
     weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and will increase
     his chances of hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from
     enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming
     traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
     inhabit the dungeons.
 
Constitution
     Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
     body, and to recover from damage received. Therefore a character
     with a high constitution will receive more hit points and also
     recover them faster while resting.

Charisma
     Charisma represents a character's personality and physical
     appearance. A character with a high charisma will receive better
     prices from store owners, whereas a character with a very low
     charisma may be robbed blind. A high charisma will also mean more
     starting money for the character. Charisma is also used when
     calculating the success of a mindcrafter at dominating a monster.
 

***** <PrimarySkills>
=== Primary Skills ===

Characters possess some different abilities which can help them to
survive. The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and
class. Abilities may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase
with the level of the character with the rate of increase dependent
upon the level of the character.
 
Melee
     Melee is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
     Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but if
     his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive more
     blows per round with lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both
     modify the ability to hit an opponent. This skill increases with
     the level of the character.
 
Bows and Throws
     Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in
     this skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this
     ability may modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the
     amount of damage done, and the ability to hit a creature. This
     skill increases with the level of the character.
 
Saving Throws
     A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects
     of a spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not
     include spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as
     quaffing a nasty potion. This ability increases with the level of
     the character, but then most high level creatures are better at
     casting spells, so it tends to even out. A high wisdom also
     increases this ability.
 
Stealth
     The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with
     good stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the
     first blow. Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy
     character entirely, allowing a player to avoid certain fights.
     This skill is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
     improve unless magically enhanced.
 
Disarming
     Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and includes
     picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain
     the character some experience. A trap must be found before it can
     be disarmed. Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to
     disarm, and this ability increases with the level of the
     character.
 
Magical Devices
     Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience
     and knowledge. Spell users such as magi and priests are therefore
     much better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This
     skill is modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of
     the character.
 
Perception (Searching Frequency)
     Perception is the ability to notice something without actively
     seeking it out. This skill is based entirely upon race and class,
     and will never improve unless magically enhanced.
 
Searching (Searching Ability)
     To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps, and
     traps on chests. Rogues are the best at searching, but magi,
     rangers, and priests are also good at it. This skill is based
     entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless
     magically enhanced.

Infra-vision
     Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the
     dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the player to
     see walls and objects. Infra-vision will allow a character to see
     any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain distance. This ability
     works equally well with or with out a light source. The majority
     of XAngband's creatures are cold-blooded, and will not be detected
     unless lit up by a light source. Most non human races have innate
     infra-vision ability. Human can gain infra-vision only if it is
     magically enhanced.


***** <StatBonusTable>
=== Stat Bonus Tables ===

Each of the races and classes has certain modifications to their
starting statistics an experience penalty. The experience penalty is
designed to 'balance' the races with better starting statistics and
abilities by requiring them to earn more experience before advancing a
level.

starting abilities. Players may also receive an additional level-based

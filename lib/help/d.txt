HOBBIT
--------

Also known as Halflings, hobbits are small, happy folks, with
large and furry feets. While not as strong or tough as most
races, they are agile and stealthy, and make excellent rogues,
scouts, spies and other similar jobs. Training with slings and
small missile weapons also makes the hobbits slightly better at
shooting and throwing.

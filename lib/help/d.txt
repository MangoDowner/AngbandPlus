DWARF
-------

Dwarves are the hardy, short mountain peoples of Portralis. 
They are short, but tough, and dwarven males are almost always 
bearded. Dwarves have lived in the mountain caverns for as long 
as history can remember, and are known to be tough, strong 
and hard working peoples. They are also known for their fine 
warriors and mastery of the axe. Dwarven axes are of very high 
quality, and so are the dwarven armors. They are mostly found 
in their mountain homelands, although some of them have chosen
to establish themselves in the kingdom of Ivhala.

Dwarves are tough. They are the most hardy race of Portralis, and 
they make the finest armors, and are also the best at wearing them. 
They are also strong and skilled in combat, especially with axes. 
However, although present in Ivhala, most dwarves lack social skills, 
and will generally live in their mountains, with little contact 
with the outside world. This makes them quick to judge other races 
with prejudices, and they can also be rather arrogant sometimes. 
Also, due to their short size and preference for taking hits rather 
than dodging them, dwarves lack in speed and agility. Finally, 
dwarves are very martial, and aren't too good with magic.

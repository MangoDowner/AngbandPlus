=================== "Map" of Middle Earth =======================

There are four maps you can choose when beginning a game of FAangband.  The 
standard wilderness, extended wilderness and hybrid dungeon basically use the 
map below (although in the case of the hybrid dungeon, travel between dungeons 
is via portal).  The Angband dungeon map uses a standard Angband model, where 
the player starts in town, and there is dungeon immediately below.

Below is a rough diagram of the linkages between the regions of Middle
Earth which your character can visit.  Dungeons are shown in brackets under
the region where their entrance lies (Nan Dungortheb is not strictly a dungeon,
but acts like one in some ways).  Some towns are clearly marked; for the
others and for a description of towns, see "town.txt".  For more information
about wilderness and dungeons, see "wild-dun.txt".  Note that the routes
marked with *s are only available in the compressed_map (default) option.

=================== Game modes =======================

***** <Thrall>
    Thrall
The player starts on the steps to Angband, already in an area of high danger.  
This mode often leads to quick death.  It is not available for the Angband 
dungeon map.

***** <Ironman>
    Ironman 
This option, not recommended for non-advanced players, prevents the
player from returning to areas of less danger by staircase, path, Word of
Recall or teleport level.

***** <Disconnected stairs>
    Disconnected stairs 
When you enter a new area, you don't start on a path or staircase back to the 
previous one.

***** <Small device>
    Small device 
Distance of seeing, casting spells, shooting and so on are all halved.
This is useful for playing with large tiles, or on small devices.

***** <No artifacts>
    No artifacts
No artifacts will be created. Ever.

***** <No selling>
    No selling
Shopkeepers will never pay you for items you sell, though they will still
identify unknown items for you, and will still sell you their wares. To
balance out income in the game, gold found will be increased.

***** <Smart cheat>
    Smart cheat
Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, and to
use this information to choose the best attacks.

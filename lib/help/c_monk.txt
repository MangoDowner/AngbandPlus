#####R=== Monks ===

#####GDescription
The Monk character class is very different from all other classes. 
Although they can use weapons and armour just like any other class, 
their training in martial arts makes them much more powerful with no 
armour nor weapons. To gain the resistances necessary for survival at 
higher levels a monk may need to wear some kind of armour, but if the 
armour worn is too heavy, it will severely disturb their martial arts 
maneuvers. As the monk advances levels, new, powerful forms of attack 
become available. Their defensive capabilities (blocking and dodging) 
increase likewise, but if armour is being worn, this effect decreases. 
It is rumoured that the monastic training even makes monks faster than 
any other character class! Fortunately, the amount of armour a monk can
wear while still fighting efficiently increases with experience. 

#####GPrimary Stats
Wisdom (spell casting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
A monk may choose one realm of magic and learn 24 spell levels from it.

The different sects of monks are devoted to different areas of magic.  
The typical monk utilizes his internal powers, and uses the *****m_tribal.txt*0[Tribal] 
realm. A monk who serves the greater powers can choose the *****m_valar.txt*0[Valarin] 
realm, while monks who deal with the phantasmal can take the realms of 
*****m_spirit.txt*0[Spirit] or *****m_illus.txt*0[Illusion]. Monks who take one of the major realms can only 
learn from the first four books.

#####GStarting Equipment
A monk begins the game with:
    L1 spellbook of chosen realm
    A potion of healing
    Soft leather armor
If they are *very* lucky they may also begin with:
    a cloak of protection

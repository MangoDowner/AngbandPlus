=== Character Statistics and Skills ===

This file describes your character.  It discusses the attributes shown on 
the left side of the main window, the basic skills characters possess, and the 
various special immunities and qualities that characters may acquire in their 
adventures.  It also tells you how to keep track of all this information.

=== Character Attributes Shown on the Left Side of the Main Window ===
     
Level:        Your character's level.  It reflects how powerful you are; level
              1 is a beginning character, while level 50 is the maximum you can
              reach.
Next:         The amount of experience necessary for the next level.  
              Experience affects almost everything else about your character.  
              As he kills monsters, casts spells and prays prayers for the 
              first time, learns about an object kind by using it, disarms 
              traps, and unlocks doors.
AU:           Represents your current gold supply. Gold is amazingly handy, 
              because everything the town can sell can be yours with enough of 
              the stuff.  
Vital Statistics (STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON and CHR):
              Your character has six primary statistics, or stats. The lowest 
              any stat can go is 0, a level which greatly reduces any abilities
              that stat influences. The lowest "safe" figure for most stats is
              4, but you can't expect any significant bonuses until the stat
              reaches 15 or higher. The highest a stat can rise without 
              equipment or race bonuses is 20. More information on individual 
              stats is available below.
AC:           Armor class helps prevent you getting killed.  It may be 
              increased by equipping more and better armor, and by increasing 
              your Dexterity.  
HP:           Each character has hit points, representing how much damage he 
              can sustain before he dies.  The maximum number of hit points is
              derived from race, class, level, and constitution.  Hit points 
              may be regained by resting, or by a variety of magical means.
SP:           Each character has spell points, or mana, which represents how 
              many spells a character can cast (or tunes he can play). Mana may
              be regained by resting or some rare magical means.

=== Stats ===

Strength:     Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee and with 
              missile weapons.  Increases in Strength allow you to use heavier
              weapons, and make you more likely to hit through armor.  Strength
              is also useful in tunneling and for carrying heavy items without
              being slowed down.
Intelligence: Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mages, as well
              as spellswords, rangers and mystics. For these classes, this stat
              will affect the number of spells they may learn each level, the 
              number of spell points they receive, and the chance for spells to
              fail. Intelligent characters also use magic devices, pick locks,
              mix potions, and disarm traps more effectively.
Wisdom:       Wisdom affects the spellcasting abilities of priests, paladins, 
              and mystics. For these classes, this stat will affect the number
              of spells they may learn each level, the number of spell points 
              they receive, and the chance for or spells to fail.  Wise 
              characters also have a better chance of resisting magical spells
              cast upon them by monsters.
Dexterity:    Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness.  A high 
              dexterity may allow a character to get multiple blows with 
              lighter weapons, and will significantly increase his chances of 
              hitting with any weapon and dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity
              is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps, and protecting 
              yourself from some of the thieves that inhabit the dungeon.
Constitution: Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his 
              body, and to recover from stuns, poison, disease, cuts, and pure
              damage. Therefore a character with a high constitution will 
              receive more hit points and also recover them faster while 
              resting.
Charisma:     Charisma represents a character's personality and physical 
              appearance. It affects the spellcasting abilities of bards, 
              affecting the number of spell points they receive and the chance
              of their tunes failing. A charismatic character will also receive
              better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a very 
              low charisma may be robbed blind. Finally, a high charisma will
              allow monsters that are magically calmed to remain non-agressive
              longer. 


=== Skills ===

Characters possess various abilities which help them to survive and prosper.  
The starting abilities of a character are based upon race and class. Abilities 
may be adjusted by high or low stats, and some increase with experience level.

Saving Throw: A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the 
              effects of a spell cast on him by another person/creature. This 
              does not include spells cast on the player by his own stupidity,
              such as quaffing a nasty potion.  
Stealth:      The ability to move silently about is very useful.  Characters
              with good stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining 
              the first blow.  Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy 
              character entirely.
Fighting:     Melee (hand to hand) combat depends on this skill.  A character
              with a low fighting skill cannot hope to either hit monsters 
              often or do much damage if he does.  
Shooting:     Using ranged missile weapons depends on this skill.  The higher 
              the character's shooting ability, the more frequently he will 
              hit his targets and the more damage he will do when he does.  
Throwing:     Using thrown weapons depends on this skill.  The higher your
              character's throwing ability, the more frequently he will hit 
              his target.  
Disarming:    Disarming is the ability to safely remove traps and pick locks on 
              chests and doors. A trap must be found before it can be disarmed.  
Bypass Trap:  If you are aware of a trap's location, there is a small chance 
              (larger if you are a thief) that you can step into its square 
              without triggering it.  This skill represents this ability.
Magic Device: The chance of succesfully using a magical device such as a wand,
              staff, or any activatable object depends on this skill.
Searching:    Searching affects the chance of success when actively looking for
              secret doors, floor traps, and traps on chests. 
Search Freq.: This determines the chance to find something when not actively 
              searching.
Digging:      Digging is a tedious art, but characters with a higher skill
              may do it much faster than others. 
Alchemy:      Mixing potions is a hazardous art, and without a high alchemy 
              skill it is likely to cause accidental explosions or no effect
              at all.  Characters who excel in alchemy may learn alchemical 
              formulae by simply quaffing potions.


=== Other abilities ===

Infra-vision: Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources.  It will allow 
              a character to see any warm-blooded creature up to a certain 
              distance. This ability works equally well with or without a light
              source.  Several of the playable races have innate infravision.

Racial Ab.:   Angels and Demons, being more magical than the other races, may
              have access to special, innate, magical spells.  These can be 
              activated by the 'U' command, and need some time to recharge.

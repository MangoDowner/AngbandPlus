PORTRALIS STATS GUIDE
-----------------------

At the beginning of the game, all stats begins at 5. Some may be a
little higher or lower depending on your race. Every time you gain
a level, you will be awarded two stat points which you can use to
increase one of your stats. To do this, go into the character's
display('C'), and press 's'. If you have at least one stat point
left, you will be able to raise one of your stats. Now, here's
a detailed description of what each stats will do:

STRENGTH:

Strength measures how strong you are and how much you can carry. High
strength can provide extremely powerful bonuses to melee characters.
If you plan to be a melee specialised character, you will probably
want to have a high strength, as it will allow you to do more damages
in combat, and to carry heavier stuff such as powerful armors and
heavy two-handed weapons.

Effects of Strength:
        - +5 to_d bonus per points.
	- +1% to total melee damages for every points.
        - Increased carrying capacity.
        - +1 to_hit per two points.
        - Increase number of blows, along with dexterity.

INTELLIGENCE:

Intelligence measures how good you are at crafting spells and using
magic. Intelligence provides additional mana points for you to use,
and will allow you to cast bigger spells. It is a must for any
mana-based spellcasters. Also, having a high intelligence will allow
you to gain extra skill points per levels, so even non-mage characters
should consider putting some points in intelligence for the extra skills.

Effects of Intelligence:
        - +10 mana per points.
	- You gain 1 extra skill points for every 12 points of the
	  average between Intelligence and Wisdom.

WISDOM:

Widows measures a character's spiritual abilities, self-control and
the overall maturity of the character. When casting spells, you may
choose to not use mana points, and use wisdom-based spellcasting
(which can represent using the power of your mind, or praying your
god for a spell.). Using wisdom-based spells costs no mana, but trying
to cast big spells has a chance of failure. When using the 'p' command,
you will cast a spell using wisdom. If the spell's cost is below or
equal to your wisdom, the spell will have 100% success rate. Otherwise,
there will be a chance of failure which increases with the spell's cost.
And if you try to cast a VERY expensive spell with a low wisdom... it
may backfire! Finally, wisdom will also allow you to resist some spells
and effects such as fear and confusion, and like intelligence, it allows
you to gain extra skill points.

Effects of Wisdom:
        - Allow to cast bigger wisdom-based spells.
        - Increase resistance to effects.
        - You gain 1 extra skill points for every 12 points of the
	  average between Intelligence and Wisdom.

DEXTERITY:

Dexterity measures the character's ability to aim right, to hit enemies
and to dodge their blows more easily. Dexterity is very helpful to melee
characters, and is a must for any archer-type character. Higher dexterity
mean higher to_hit, which mean you will be able to land more damaging
blows to your enemies. Also, a high dexterity will improve your shooting
multiplier, making your ranged attacks much more powerful.

Also consider the Ranger's Weapon Finesse ability when raising Dexterity.
This ability allow you to use dexterity to do damages instead of strength.
So if you plan on focusing on dexterity, this ability can help you get
a high hit rate AND damages!

Effects of Dexterity:
        - +10 to_hit per points.
	- +5% to_hit per points.
	- +5 to_d to ranged attacks.
        - +1% to ranged damages for every points.
        - +1 to AC for every two points.
        - Increase number of blows, among with Strength.

CONSTITUTION:

Constitution measures how tough the character is and how much damage
he or she can take before dying. Constitution raises your hp, and having
a high hp can be EXTREMELY helpful. All characters should consider
putting some points into constitution, especially melee fighters who
may need to endure a few ranged attacks before reaching the foes.
Keep in mind that there are some life boosting abilities and items,
and that the more hp you have, the more you will get from these bonuses.

Effects of Constitution:
        - +25 hp per points.
        - +5% to maximum hp.
        - 1% chance to recover from paralysis during your turn for 
          every points.

CHARISMA:

Charisma measures the character's personnality, personnal charm and
magnetism. But more importantly, it measures the character's ability
to lead and give effective orders to others. Charisma increases
friendly creatures ability to hit and damage enemies, and is very
important is you plan on summoning lots of friendly creatures.
Also, merchants likes charismatic characters a lot, and such characters
often pay less in stores than a less charismatic character would.
Finally, characters with high charisma may sometimes be able to get
better dialog answers when speaking with other characters!

Effects of Charisma:
        - Increase monsters's damages of all attacks and spells. 
        - +5 bonus to_hit for friendly monsters for every points
          above 5.
        - Reduce the prices in stores.
	- May give you better dialog answers.

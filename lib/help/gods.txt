#####RThe Beginner's Guide to the Gods.

#####G1.  Introduction
        Everybody likes to have a little helping hand now and then.  What
could be better than having a god on your side?  But it's not quite that easy.
The gods won't help just any mortal who calls for help.  You have to give them
a little something too.

#####G2.  How Do I Get in on This?
        When you start a character, you get a choice of whether or not you 
wish to begin worshipping a God (unless you're something like a priest - they
*must* start with a God to worship). If you do choose to be a follower of one
of the Gods, you will gain certain abilities provided you do not do things 
that displease them. The measure of how happy your God is with you is your
piety - the Pt stat is your measure of piety. Different actions will allow you 
to gain or lose piety over time. 

#####G3.  So, Who Are These Gods?
        In ToME, there are three Gods you may choose to worship, being:
1. *****g_eru.txt*0[Eru Illuvatar] - the father of the Valar. 
2. *****g_manwe.txt*0[Manwe Sulimo] - the second strongest of the Valar (Morgoth was the strongest).
3. *****g_tulkas.txt*0[Tulkas] - Another of the Valar, Tulkas values strength and courage.

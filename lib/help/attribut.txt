
====== Character Attributes ======

--- Basic attributes ---

Experience:
     As you kill monsters and pick up treasure you gain experience.
     In most *bands, you can use gold to buy stuff at the store. There are no
shops in Ironband, but instead gold (money and gems) gain you experience.
Once you reach a higher level, some low-grade money (like copper) will no
longer yield experience. 

Character Level:
     Your level depends on your experience.  This improves hitpoints and
spellpoints and most of the basic character abilities, and lets you
learn new spells and gain attributes.
     As you gain levels, your title changes to reflect your growing power.
     In Ironband, you can only get up to L36 (as opposed to L50 in other *bands).

Hitpoints:
     Your hitpoints are your life wrapped up in a number; if they ever drop
below zero, you die.  Resting will restore hitpoints, but you should always have
some quicker way to heal yourself on hand.  Your maximum hitpoints depends on
your level and race, plus a constitution bonus.

Spellpoints:
     If you use magic, you will also have spellpoints, or mana.  Your maximum
mana depends on your level and your wisdom.
     In Ironband, your SP only regenerate when you go down stairs. So use
them wisely, and retreat to the stairs down if you run out.

Armour Class:
     Armour class (AC) makes you harder to hit in melee, and reduces the damage
you take from many (but not all) monster blows.  You can raise it by equipping
more and better armour, by increasing your Agility, and by activating various
temporary effects.  As time passes, you will find this value rising past 100,
even to 150 and above at very high levels.

Score:
     Your score in Ironband depends on how much experience you have earned and
how deep in the dungeon you have ventured.

Resistances:   
     Some spells, potions and other dungeon objects can temporarily give 
the player stronger resistance to the elemental attacks; fire, cold, acid, 
electricity, poison, and confusion.  A line will show which temporary 
resistances the player currently has.


--- Vital Statistics ---

     You have nine primary statistics, or stats.  Each of them has important
effects, and how you juggle equipment to boost some stats at the expense of
others can greatly help or hinder your adventuring.  

Values for stats:
     Stats range from 3 to 18/220.  The progression of stats goes from 3 -> 17,
18, 18/10, 18/20 -> 18/220.  
     The lowest any stat can go is 3, a level that greatly reduces any abilities
that stat influences.  The lowest "safe" figure for most stats is 7, but you
can't expect any significant bonuses until the stat reaches 18 or higher.  Once
you get a stat that high, further increases will greatly enhance your abilities. 
     Stats depend on your internal stats, the equipment you are wearing, and
various temporary conditions.  The color of the stat becomes a darker green when 
sustained.

As you go deeper in the dungeon, your stats will get better in several ways.
- When you reach DL 2, 4, and 6, one of your stats will go up a lot, one a little
and one actually go down. This reflects your character discovering their true
potential (and is designed to make you play a character different from what you
might have expected). [You can turn this feature off using the 'no discovery' birth option.]
- When you reach DL 8, 10, 12... one of your stats will go up 1 point. The stat is
chosen at random, but is influenced by your race to some extent.
- Whenever you gain a CL you can increase one of your stats - you choose which.

          Strength
               Strength is important in fighting in melee. A high strength
               increases your damage and allows you to use heavy weapons without
               penalty. If your weapon is too heavy for your strength, you
               will get less attacks and have to-hit penalties.
               Strength is also useful in tunneling and in carrying heavy items.
 
          Intelligence
               Intelligence affects your ability to cast spells. The higher
               your Intelligence, the less the chance that your spells will fail.
               Intelligence also affects your ability to disarm traps and to
               use some magic devices, and is protective against confusion.
               If your Intelligence is really low you may have trouble reading scrolls.
 
          Wisdom
               Wisdom increases the amount of SP (mana) you have.
               As if that wasn't enough, it also improves your saving throw
               which protects you from various magical attacks.
 
          Dexterity
               Dexterity is skill with your hands. High dexterity increases
               your melee attacks per round, and your missile shot speed as 
               well if it is high enough. It also improves your chance of 
               hitting in melee.  Dexterity is useful in picking locks and 
               disarming traps. If your dexterity is low, you may sometimes 
               misfire when you try to shoot a missile weapon.
 
          Constitution
               Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his
               body, and to recover from damage, poison and stunning received.  
               A character with a high constitution will receive more hit
               points and also recover them faster while resting. Very high
               Constitution also allows the character to eat less.
 
          Agility
               Agility is your speed of movement. It can give you a +Speed
               bonus (allowing you to attack, shoot and move more often). It
               also affects your AC. A very agile character recovers faster
               from paralysis and is better protected from some of the 
               thieves that inhabit the dungeons.
               
          Stealth
               Stealth allows you to sneak around the dungeon without being
               noticed and attacked by monsters. Picking your fights is a big
               advantage. If you attack a sleeping monster, either in melee or by
               firing a missile weapon, you will get a hit and damage bonus - the 
               more stealthy you are, the bigger the bonus. And at high Stealth 
               levels you gain resistance to darkness attacks.
               Stealth is reduced by heavy body armour and big clunky boots.
               
          Perception
               Perception has many advantages. Characters with high perception
               have 'eagle eyes' and get bonuses to hit and damage with missile
               weapons. They have a chance of spotting and avoiding traps. They
               are better at searching, and get information on the magic bonuses
               of items they pick up more quickly. Their light radius is increased.
               At high levels of perception you can get infravision, and even a limited
               form of ESP which indicates your ability to hear and smell nearby 
               monsters. Perception can also help you recover from blindness quicker.
               Perception is reduced by the heavier helmets.
               
          Luck
               Luck governs your chances of finding good items. With high luck,
               you will find more useful equipment - and more artifacts, especially
               if your luck is extremely high. With low luck you will stumble on
               more junk and cursed items. Being lucky can also sometimes save you
               from an early death (when a monster hits you with an attack that should
               normally insta-kill you).


--- Abilities ---

     In addition to your stats, certain basic abilities define your character.
They depend on race, stats, and level, and may be powerfully influenced
by temporary conditions.  You cannot view your ability levels in Ironband,
unlike other *bands.

Saving Throw:
     The higher your saving throw, the more likely you are to resist the side
effects of monster blows and spells, traps, your own magic (when it fails), and
mental attacks.  Saving throw depends on race, Wisdom, and level.

Disarming:
     The higher your disarming ability, the more quickly and safely you can pick
locks and disarm chests and traps.  Race, level, dexterity, and intelligence all 
affect this ability.  

Magical Devices:
     Determines how likely you are to successfully use some magical devices or
activatable items (not including wands).  Race, level, and intelligence affect 
this ability. You need considerable skill to use high-level objects.

Detecting:
     The better your detecting, the more likely it is that you will see traps
and secret doors automatically.  Detecting depends on race, level, perception, and
equipped objects.
     Note that this ability has no relationship to your ability to sense
(pseudo-ID) objects.

Searching:
     The better you are at searching, the more likely it is that you will see
traps and secret doors by searching for them.  Searching depends on race, 
level, perception, and equipped objects.

Infravision:
     The higher your infravision, the further away you can see warm-blooded
creatures, even when invisible or not lit.


--- Conditions ---

     Your character may benefit or suffer from many different conditions.  The
most important ones are displayed on the bottom row of the main screen and the
lower part of the left panel.  We describe them as they are displayed, down,
then from left to right.

     Wounds    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage
                 every turn.
     Stunning  : Your combat and spellcasting abilities decrease.  If you are
                 too badly stunned, you can be knocked out!
     Hunger    : You need to eat every so often.  If you eat too much, you
                 become bloated and slow down.  If you eat too little, you
                 become hungry (no special effects), weak (reduced recovery),
                 feel faint (pass out every so often), and finally starve (take
                 damage every turn).
     Blindness : You cannot see most monsters, it is harder to learn about
                 objects or what's around you, and get only vague information
                 when many things happen.  You often miss monsters, and cannot
                 cast spells or read scrolls.
     Confusion : You move and attack randomly and cannot cast spells, read
                 scrolls, or use magical devices.
     Fear      : You cannot use melee combat.
     Poison    : Instead of recovering battle damage, you take additional damage
                 every turn.

State:
     You can sometimes be in one of several different states.

     Paralyzed : You cannot do ANYTHING until the effects wear off.
     Rest      : You are resting (double speed recovery of hitpoints and mana).
     Repeat    : You are repeating an action (like tunneling).
     Searching : You are searching (automatic search, but slowed speed).

Speed:
     The faster you are, the less time you take to perform all kinds of actions.
It is vital not to become too slow.  As you descend into the dungeon, you need
to find ways to hasten yourself temporarily and permanently.
     A speed of +10 is double speed ("fast"), and one of +20 is triple speed
("very fast").  A speed of 10 is half speed ("slow"), and one of -20 is one
third speed ("very slow").
     Permanent speed bonuses add to your base speed.  Temporary effects may
increase or reduce speed by 10.  

Depth:
     How deep in the dungeon you are.

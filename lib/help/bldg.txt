#####R=== Historical Town View ===
The town is composed of both stores and buildings. 

#####RStores
The stores are where your adventurer can pick up the supplies they need before
entering the depths of the  dungeon. These include:
[[[[[GGeneral Store (1):] food, torches, the necessities.
[[[[[GArmorer (2):] to protect from the ravages of the dungeon.
[[[[[GWeaponsmith (3):] they carry anything sharp and to the point.
[[[[[GTemple Shop (4):] prayerbooks and those items holy.
[[[[[GAlchemist (5):] for all sorts of bubbling potions and scrolls.
[[[[[GMagic Shop (6):] get your wands and spellbooks here.
[[[[[GBlack Market (7):] the prices are high, but item unique.
[[[[[GYour Home (8):] To store your precious treasures.
[[[[[GBook Store (9):] for all sorts of basic spell book needs.

#####ROther Buildings

found in some towns. These Buildings (represented by +'s) include:

All buildings are made of stone and unlikely to move around.

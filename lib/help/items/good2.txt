GOOD ITEMS -- Alternative document

      In the listing for great items which follows, keep in mind that all great items
      get all the bonuses that good items get. If a bonus to-hit, to-dam or to AC
      is given for a great item, that bonus is in addition to the good item bonus.

      A "low resist" is one of the following: resist fire, resist cold, resist acid,
      resist lightning, sustain str., sustain int., sustain wis., sustain dex., sustain
      con., sustain cha.; all with equal probability.

      A "high resist" is resistance to one of the following: confusion, sound, light,
      darkness, chaos, nether, shards, nexus, blindness, disenchantment; all with
      equal probability. (Note that poison resistance does not qualify as a high
      resistance.)

      An item that has resist fire/cold/acid/lightning always has ignore
      fire/cold/acid/lightning as well. Exception: objects with a random low resist
      that is resist fire/cold/acid/lightning do not automatically get the
      corresponding ignore characteristic.

      The notation "XdY" indicates a number obtained by rolling an Y-sided die
      X times. (Thus 4d6 indicates a number from 4 to 24.)

      The notation MB(X,Y) indicates an integer between X and Y inclusive that
      is dependent on dungeon depth and has a normal distribution that is
      centered about (Y-X)*(Dungeon Level/100), with depths greater than level
      100 (5000') counting as level 100.

      The notation "xdY(1 in Z)" indicates a number obtained by rolling a
      Y-sided die x times. x is equal to the number of times the 1 in Z is chance is
      made, until failure. Thus xd4(1 in 10) translates to: 0 (90% chance), 1d4
      (9% chance), 2d4 (0.9% chance), 3d4 (0.09% chance) ... There is no limit,
      so theoretically it is possible to get maxint, but don't count on it :-).

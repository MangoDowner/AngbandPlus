#####R=== Possessors ===

#####GDescription
Possessors are unusual; they aren't good fighters, and they can't cast 
magic. Their special ability is that of being able to leave their 
bodies and inhabit corpses. While "in" a corpse, the Possessor gains 
the abilities of the monster, and their hitpoints and the monster's 
are averaged. While in the incorporeal form between bodies, they have 
only one hitpoint. 

#####GPrimary Stats
Wisdom (spell casting stat)

#####GMagic Usage
The strange art of reanimating the corpse of a monster and making
it one's own can be of extreme benefit to those skilled in it. The body
the player possesses can grant powerful abilities, such as increased
speed, summoning, healing, breathing, and various resistances, and often
gives the player a large number of hit points. Possessing uniques is
especially neat.  

Possessors leave their own body by using the 'm' command, and choosing 
"[I]incarnating powers".  They then become a very vulnerable ghostly 
being which travels to where another corpse is lying on the floor, and 
possesses it by again using the 'm' command.  Once possessed, many 
monster corpses allow the player to perform various special actions
(such as blinking or summoning) by using the option "[U]se your race
powers".

All corpses alter the player's melee attacks. When they incarnate in a 
monster that allows the use of a weapon, monster blows are ignored 
[[[[[Btotaly]. When they incarnate in a monster that doesn't allow use of a 
weapon (dragons for example) they use the monster blows [[[[[Band only them]!

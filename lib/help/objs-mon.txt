
====== Objects ======

     The mines far below the surface are full of objects just waiting to be
picked up and used.  The treasures of long-forgotten kingdoms, dragon's hordes,
heirlooms, wizard's stashes, and the plunder from every age of the world unite
with the scattered earthly possessions of all the foolish adventurers who died
before you to offer unimaginable wealth for those bold enough to seize it.


--- Learning about objects ---

Learning about objects:
     When you begin the game, most objects are unknown to you, and an important
task is to learn more about them so that you can use them reliably.  The
standard way to learn about an object is to identify it, but scrolls of Identify
and Staffs of Perception are too expensive to use on everything.

Full identification:
     Some items have special powers.  Ego-item descriptions usually tell you
everything, but artifacts are known only by legend.  To learn absolutely
everything about an object, read a scroll of *identify* on it.  Such scrolls are
rare and expensive; if you don't have access to one, try using the object a lot
and inscribing it.

Scanning wargear automatically (Pseudo-ID):
     Every so often, you automatically scan un-identified wargear (weapons and
armour).  If you learn something, the item is inscribed.

     Item description               weak sensing            strong sensing
     average item:                  (no inscription)        "average"
     item with plusses              "good"                  "good"
     ego-item (weapon of flame)     "good"                  "excellent"
     artifact (unique item)         "good"                  "special"
     cursed artifact                "cursed"                "terrible"
     cursed ego-item                "cursed"                "worthless"
     cursed ordinary object         "cursed"                "cursed"	


--- Object information ---

     'I'nspecting a specific object will pop up a special display that may tell
you useful things about it.  If the item is fully identified, you see all of its
attributes.
     Known attributes of equipped items are displayed in the character screen
display (type 'C' to bring up the character screen, then press 'h' to cycle
through the information).  This interface is helpful when you want to optimize
your equipment.


--- Inventory and equipment ---

Your inventory (backpack) and equipment (your person):
     You pick up objects by moving on top on them or staying still (if you have
the "auto_pickup" option on), or by using the 'g'et command (if you don't).  You
may carry up to 23 different items or piles of items, and have 12 areas of your
body where wearable equipment may go.  Press 'i', and you see the contents of
your backpack; press 'e' and you see what you are wearing.  Both listings toggle
open and closed when you press the space key.  Items on the floor display in
similar fashion if you have the "easy_floor" option set.
     When choosing items, you switch between inventory and equipment by pressing
'/', and switch between the floor and either of these two by pressing '-'.

Burden:
     Carry too much weight, and you will begin to slow down, making it easier
for monsters to kill you.  The point at which your load thus hinders you depends
on your strength.  You begin to slow down at 60% of your max carrying capacity.

Floor items:
     If objects are allowed to stack (which they are by default), up to 23
objects or piles of objects may stack in a single floor grid.


--- Object types ---

Magical devices:
     In NPPAngband, wands, staves and rods all stack, and don't unstack 
when used.

Chests:
     Chests are difficult and dangerous to open, as they usually contain both
traps and locks.  If you succeed, you may be rewarded handsomely.  Chests in 
NPPAngband are themed, ranging from large amounts of gold to all kinds of 
weapons and armor, and some of the most powerful items in the game.

Scroll of Word of Recall:
     The Scroll of Word of Recall deserves special mention.  Read in the
dungeon, it brings you back to the town.  Read in the town, it takes you back to
your previous recall depth.  This spell takes a little time to take effect, so
don't expect it to save you in a crisis.  Should you mistakenly read a Scroll of
Word of Recall, you may cancel it by reading another.
     If you read this scroll above your current recall depth, you get a special
message asking you if you want to reset it.  If you say yes, the level you are
on becomes the new recall depth.

Ego-Weapons and Armours:
     Some rare weapons and armours have special abilities.  These are called ego
items, and are feared by great and meek.

Dragon Scale Mails:
     These extremely rare pieces of armour come in many different colors, each
protecting you against the relevant dragons.  They also occasionally allow you
to breathe as dragons do!

Artifacts:
     There are rumors of incredibly rare, unique artifacts which are even more
powerful than ego items.  Some artifacts are standard, and you may already know
of their fame, while others will certainly be unfamiliar to you and will need to
be fully identified (*identified*).  Artifacts cannot be destroyed, although
they can be disenchanted.


--- Object enhancement ---

     Weapons and armour may have bonuses to hit chance, damage, and armour
class; it can be very useful indeed to increase these values by reading scrolls
of Enchant Weapon and Enchant Armour.
     - The higher the plusses are, the harder it is to raise them further.  It
       is especially difficult to raise them above 9 or 10.
     - The larger the pile of objects you try to enchant, the more likely it is
       that you will fail.  However, ammunition is unusually easy to enchant.
     - You can sometimes break curses on objects by enchanting them.


--- Object destruction ---

     Objects may be damaged or destroyed on the floor, in your backpack, and
(sometimes) even damaged while you are wearing them.

     - Acid destroys armour, weapons, missile launchers, ammunition, scrolls,
       staffs, and chests.  It may damage equipped armour that does not ignore
       acid.
     - Electricity destroys rings, amulets, rods, and wands.
     - Fire destroys torches, arrows, missile launchers, hafted weapons and
       polearms, gloves, boots, cloaks, shields, soft body armour, spellbooks,
       scrolls, staffs, and chests.
     - Frost, sound, and shards destroy potions and empty bottles.
     - Equipped items with plusses can be disenchanted.
     - Wands and staffs can be destroyed by failed recharges.


--- Cursed Objects ---

     Many cursed items exist in the Pits -- either left behind as the result of
failed attempts to create magic items, or deliberately placed by gleeful evil
sorcerers who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.
     These horrible objects look perfectly innocent, but will detract from your
character's stats or abilities if worn.  You cannot remove them without breaking
the curse first.  In fact, some are so badly cursed that even this will not
work, and more potent methods are needed.
     If you wear or wield a cursed item, you will immediately feel deathly cold,
and the item will be marked "cursed".
     Shopkeepers will refuse to buy any item that is known to be cursed.



====== Monsters ======


Monsters are worth experience:
     Defeat a monster, and you will gain experience.  The amount you gain
depends on the base monster value, multiplied by its native depth, divided by
your level.

Your Monster Memory:
     When you see a monster for the first time, all you know are its physical
attributes and whatever information the monster description may provide.  As you
fight and kill monsters, use various attacks on them, probe them with magic, and
get killed by them, you learn more about their strengths and weaknesses.
     You recall this memory in one of two ways:  'l'ooking at/e'x'amining the
monster and then pressing 'r' for recall, or by pressing '/' and typing the
monster's letter.
     Unlike object memory, monster memory can be passed on even after your
character dies.  You may use menu commands or command-line options to open up a
specific file that contains a character with a monster memory.

The Monster Health Bar:
     A good way to keep track of a specific monster is to target it.  When you
do so, its health bar appears on the left side of the main screen, just below
the hitpoint and mana indicators.  Similar health bars are also used when
looking around and when displaying the closest monsters.
The health bar uses several letter and colors to tell you more about the monster.
Confused - "c", Stunned - "s", Sleeping - "z", and "* when
the monster is none of the above.  Otherwise - green when healthy, and yellow, 
orange, and red when wounded, and if frightened - violet,.

The Monster Mana Bar:
     A good way to keep track of a specific monster is to target it.  When you
do so, its health bar appears on the left side of the main screen, just below
the hitpoint and mana indicators.  Similar health bars are also used when
looking around and when displaying the closest monsters.
 
Monster attributes:
     The special attributes of monsters can make all the difference to the
danger they pose to you.  Some of the more interesting are listed and described.

     - Hitpoints : Some monsters die easily, others can withstand almost
       anything.

       others evade or block them quite often.
     - Awareness : Some monsters will stay asleep even if you dance in front of
       them, others are ever vigilant.  The distance that monsters can
       perceive you (if you are not in line of sight) also varies greatly.

     - Color : The color of a monster can be a valuable hint.
     - Chromatic : Changes colors randomly.

       ordinary walls.
     - Hurt by ... : Monsters may be especially susceptible to light or rock

       and many other things!
     - Casting speed : Be careful of monsters that cast spells very often,
       especially if they also move quickly.


====== Objects ======

     The mines far below the surface are full of objects just waiting to be
picked up and used.  The treasures of long-forgotten kingdoms, dragon's hordes,
heirlooms, wizard's stashes, and the plunder from every age of the world unite
with the scattered earthly possessions of all the foolish adventurers that died
before you to offer unimaginable wealth for those bold enough to seize it.


--- Learning about objects ---

Learning about objects:
     When you begin the game, most objects are unknown to you, and an important
task is to learn more about them so that you can use them reliably.  The
standard way to learn about an object is to identify it, but scrolls of Identify
and Staffs of Perception don't come cheap.  They also don't work on everything;
mushrooms cannot be identified with magic.

Full identification:
     Some items have special powers.  Ego-item descriptions usually tell you
everything, but artifacts are known only by legend.  A number of items (usually
artifacts and ego-items) may have random powers.  To learn absolutely everything
about an object, read a scroll of *identify* on it.  Such scrolls are rare and
expensive; if you don't have access to one, try using the object a lot and
inscribing it.
     Fully identified objects have light blue indexes, identified objects have
white, and unknown objects grey.

Scanning wargear automatically (Pseudo-ID):
     The first time you walk over a weapon, missile, or piece of armour, you
examine it for anything unusual.  Your ability to learn about wargear depends on
your perception skill, modified by any bonuses to awareness granted by equipped
items.
     When you wear or wield such an item, you examine it again, this time more
closely and with a greater chance of success.  Given a decent perception skill,
you have a pretty good shot at learning something.  Be careful though:  Objects
may be cursed and need special magic to remove!

Scanned objects are marked with the following inscriptions
   Item description               low perception          high perception
   average item:                  "unknown"               "average"
   item with plusses              "good"                  "good"
   ego-item (weapon of flame)     "good"                  "excellent"
   artifact (unique item)         "good"                  "special"
   cursed artifact                "cursed"                "terrible"
   cursed ego-item                "cursed"                "worthless"
   cursed ordinary object         "cursed"                "cursed"
   failed to learn anything       "unknown", no message appears

     Once you equip the weapon or armour, and it is actually better (or worse)
then the inscription claims, you will eventually learn more about it as you use
it in battle.  An ego-item that was originally marked "unknown" will first be
revealed as "good", then as "excellent".
     Characters who have taken the Oath of Iron are especially good at scanning
wargear, and (if their perception skill is fairly high) will be able to
instantly identify any weapon or armour they equip.

Sensing other wearable objects:
     You can often learn about rings and amulets by putting them on, and, if
that doesn't work, by wearing them for a while.  This also gives you experience.
However, rings and amulets are often cursed...

Learning about magical devices:
     You can learn the name of magical devices that you successfully use; when
you do, you get experience.
     If your perception and/or magical device skills are good enough, you can
learn about the charges on wands and staffs, especially low-level ones.  Bonuses
to awareness also work here.
     Use most magical devices often enough, especially if your perception and
magical device skills are high, and you will eventually learn more about the
damage they do or the power they have.  You may check this information by using
the 'I'nspect command.

Learning about potions and scrolls:
     There are three ways to learn about potions and scrolls:  You can sell
them, identify them, or learn about them by using them.  Learning by using is
risky but highly rewarding.  Not only do you get a lot of experience this way,
but many scrolls and potions are more powerful when you read or quaff them
unaware and unsensed.  If you quaff unaware every potion that attacks stats, and
every one that improves them, your total stat gain will improve by about 3.

Learning about mushrooms:
     You must eat mushrooms in order to learn about them.  There are some very
useful 'shrooms out there, but also some truly nasty ones...


--- Object information ---

     'I'nspecting a specific object will pop up a special display that tells you
useful things about the object kind, legends and lore, and specific object
attributes.
     Known attributes of equipped items are displayed in the character screen
display (type 'C' to bring up the character screen, then press 'h' to cycle
through the information).  This interface is helpful when you want to optimize
your equipment.
     All object types that you are aware of are listed in the knowledge menu
('~'), option 5: "known objects".


--- Inventory, equipment, quiver ---

Your inventory (backpack) and equipment (your person):
     You pick up objects by moving on top on them (if you have the "auto_pickup"
option on), or by using the 'g'et command.  You may carry up to 23 different
items or piles of items, and have 12 areas of your body where wearable equipment
may go.  Press 'i', and you see the contents of your backpack; press 'e' and you
see what you are wearing.  Both listings toggle open and closed when you press
the space key.  Items on the floor display in similar fashion.
     When choosing items, you switch between inventory and equipment by pressing
'/', and switch between the floor and either of these two by pressing '-'.
     Carry too much weight, and you will begin to slow down, making it easier
for monsters to kill you.  The point at which your load thus hinders you depends
on your strength.

Your quiver:
     Your equipment includes a quiver, which may hold up to ten different kinds
of ammo.  Once placed in the quiver (using the wield command), ammo normally
sorts in the quiver slots just as it does in the backpack.  You may lock ammo
into a specific slot, and make shooting a lot more convenient, by inscribing it
with inscriptions similar to "@1", or "@f1".  Wherever you store it, ammo still
takes up space; for every 99 missiles (or fraction thereof) that you place in
the quiver slots, you lose an inventory slot.  Any such lost slots will be
clearly marked.  Ammo on the floor will automatically combine with similar items
in the quiver, which makes cleaning up after a big fight much easier.


--- Object types ---

Wands:
     Known wands stack, combining their charges.  Such a stack may be heavier,
but can be recharged more safely and effectively.

Staffs:
     Staffs never stack unless in stores (they take up plenty of space in your
backpack).  If stacked, the number of charges that they display is prefixed by a
quantity indicator (e.g. "(2x 13 charges)", which shows that each of two staffs
have 13 charges.  Staffs may be bulky, but they have lots of charges, recharge
well, and are highly durable.

Rods:
     Rods always stack.  A stack of rods with at least one charging member will
show an appropriate inscription.  When zapped, a rod is "timed out" for a given
number of turns.  Unlike wands and staffs, rods recharge automatically.  Each
recharging rod in a stack contributes to the total recharge rate; if three out
of five rods are charging, the stack's total timeout period will decrease by
three per normal player turn.

Chests:
     Chests are difficult and dangerous to open, as they usually contain both
traps and locks.  If you succeed, you may be rewarded handsomely.  If your
disarming skill is so poor that the chest refuses to open, you can bash it into
submission.  Of course, bashing does break things...

Scroll of Word of Recall:
     The Scroll of Word of Recall deserves special mention.  Read in the
dungeon, it brings you back to the town.  Read in the town, it takes you as deep
in the dungeon as you have ever gone.  This spell takes a little time to take
effect, so don't expect it to save you in a crisis.  Should you mistakenly read
a Scroll of Word of Recall, you may cancel it by reading another.

Ego-Weapons and Armours:
     Some rare weapons and armours have special abilities.  These are called ego
items, and are feared by great and meek.

Dragon Scale Mails:
     These extremely rare pieces of armour come in many different colors, each
protecting you against the relevant dragons.  They also occasionally allow you
to breathe as dragons do!

Artifacts:
     There are rumors of incredibly rare, unique artifacts which are even more
powerful than ego items.  Some artifacts are standard, and you may already know
of their fame, while others will certainly be unfamiliar to you and will need to
be fully identified (*identified*).
     Artifacts cannot be destroyed, although they can be disenchanted.  Once you
find an artifact, and either sell it or identify and leave it behind, you lose
it forever.
     A small number of artifacts, known as Set Items, are designed to be used in
conjunction with related items.  Equipping an entire set of these items will
grant the wearer additional bonuses and abilities.  Item sets generally  consist
of two items, but may include more.  You may 'I'nspect an identified artifact to
see whether it belongs to a set.


--- Object enhancement ---

     Weapons and armour have values for Skill, Deadliness, and AC; it can be
very useful indeed to increase these values by reading scrolls of Enchant Weapon
and Enchant Armour.
- The higher the plusses are above the object's normal values, the harder it
  is to raise them further.
- The larger the pile of objects you try to enchant, the more likely it is that
  you will fail.  However, ammunition and throwing weapons are unusually easy
  to enchant.
- You can sometimes break curses on objects and even turn them into ego-items
  by enchanting them.


--- Object destruction ---

     Objects may be damaged or destroyed in your backpack and (sometimes) even
damaged while you are wearing them.
     Acid destroys armour, weapons, missile launchers, and ammunition, scrolls,
parchments, staffs, and chests.  It may slightly damage equipped weapons and
armour that do not ignore acid.
     Electricity destroys rings, amulets, wands, and (on rare occasion) rods.
     Fire destroys torches, arrows, missile launchers, hafted weapons and
polearms, gloves, boots, cloaks, shields, soft body armour, spellbooks, scrolls,
parchments, staffs, and chests.
     Frost destroys potions and empty bottles.
     Equipped items with plusses can be disenchanted.  Magical devices can be
destroyed by failed recharges.


--- Cursed Objects ---

     Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid upon them by
joyful evil sorcerers who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.  These
horrible objects will look like any other item, but will detract from your
character's stats or abilities if worn.  They will also be impossible to remove
until a remove curse is performed.  In fact, some are so badly cursed that even
this will not work, and more potent methods are needed.
     If you wear or wield a cursed item, you will immediately feel deathly cold,
and the item will be marked "cursed".
     Shopkeepers will refuse to buy any item which is known to be cursed.



====== Monsters ======


Monsters are worth experience:
     Defeat a monster, and you will gain experience.  The amount you gain
depends on the base monster value (which goes up rapidly deeper in the dungeon).
It is divided by your own total skill:  a number that depends on your total
experience (spent plus unspent exp), and which ranges from 1 to 100.  Note that
raising skills has no effect whatsoever on your total experience.

Your Monster Memory:
     When you see a monster for the first time, all you know are its physical
attributes and whatever information the monster description may provide.  As you
fight and kill monsters, use various attacks on them, probe them with magic, and
get killed by them, you learn more about their strengths and weaknesses.
     You recall this memory in one of two ways:  'l'ooking at/e'x'amining the
monster and then pressing 'r' for recall, or by pressing '/' and typing the
monster's letter.
     Unlike object memory, monster memory can be passed on even after your
character dies.  You just need to make sure that the old savefile is in the
lib/save directory when you start up a new character.

The Monster Health Bar:
     A good way to keep track of a specific monster is to target it.  When you
do so, its health bar appears on the left side of the main screen, just below
the hitpoint and mana indicators.
     The health bar uses several colors to tell you more about the monster.
Frightened - violet, Confused - brown, Stunned - light blue, Sleeping - dark
blue, Otherwise - dark and light green when healthy, and yellow, orange, and red
when wounded.
     The health bar is bracketed in green when you have direct line of fire to
the monster, in white when you have indirect line of fire, and grey when you
have no line of fire at all.


Player Ghosts:
     Player ghosts vary from game to game depending on the name, sex, race, and
class of the adventurer or legendary Hero whose bones file was used during ghost
creation.  Should your character die, information about him will often be added
to a new bones file, inside the folder /lib/bones, and a future game might bring
him back from the dead...
     Should a ghost be slain, he may vanish forever, or he may return later in a
new, more powerful form!

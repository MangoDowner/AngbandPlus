============================= Specialty Abilities =============================

Specialty abilities are a way of ehancing and customizing characters.  Each
character will gain only a few specialties, so choose the ones that are the
most fun for you and best complement your playing style.

By choosing specialties, you can make your Warrior a melee machine, an archer, 
or high-AC  tank.  You can increase the mana and magical abilities of your 
spellcasters or improve their normally weak defenses.  Classes with unique 
abilites such as the Rogue's monster trap and the Druid's unarmed combat can
choose specialties to further improve these abilities.

Each character can gain a specialty ability at first level, and additional 
abilities at level 20 and level 40.  Warriors gain an additional specialty at
level 1.  Use the 'O' command to gain new specialties or view your current
specialty list.

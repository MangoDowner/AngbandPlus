Yin-YAngband 1.0 (1998-2-18)

       Initial changes is Yin-YAngband:

   Added new race, Mutant:

from -4 to +4 in every stat (random)
get random abilities (searching etc.)
may get some random resists/sustains/other flags.


    Added Mana Batteries:

You can store mana in a battery. It takes 1/5 of your original mana and may
cause some bad effects if you overcharge it. The key command is 'O'.

You can take mana out of a battery.  For this use the use magical item command.


    Consolidated magical item commands:

Now, 'a', 'u' and 'z' (or 'a', 'z' and 'Z' for the roguelike keyset) will work
for any magical item be it rod, wand, staff or mana battery.


Added circular rooms. (They look sort of oval, but they aren't, really)

    Changed various constants to make the game more interesting:

It's more common for monster/item levels to be inflated.
Abnormal rooms are twice as common and vaults/pits are 4 times as common.
More monsters generally start out on a level, and it's more likely that they
appear while you are on a level.

Added monster AI, compliments of Keldon Jones.


        Changes I intend to make:

   Revamp the magic system.
I'll either steal the one from ZAngband or make one myself.

   Change monster names and item names.
Since this is called Yin-YAngband, maybe I should change the monster/item
names to be Chinese.  I'd appreciate any help on this.

   Balance.
I need to adjust values to make the game balanced.  I'd appreciate help here
too.

Allow the charge battery command to use "Quantity?" prompts.

More strange shaped rooms and more (different) vaults.

Any ideas are more than welcome!

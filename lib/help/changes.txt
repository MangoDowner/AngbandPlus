added vampiric weapons, drain up to max(3% of monster hp,to_d of weapon) of
a warm-blooded monster HP each swing, sust con, hold life,slay undead

numbered character swings and misses at monsters

added flag to allow out-killing cursed items on floor and stop asking about
killing cursed items in possession of character

added flag to allow to outo-open/try to open doors when bumping in to them.
   it's tried only once.

Increased mana-correction for 18/220+ stat by 1.

made wizard routines controlled by number instead of character

made wizard help ^a ? available

allowed wizard tweaking of artifacts

allowed wizard creation of artifacts

allowed scrolls of enchant weapon/armor to work on anything that's possible
        (amulets of the magi, rings of slaying etc)

given scrolls of *enchant* a chance of increasing above 15 but below 25
      this does not work on the priest's enchant spells

added the ^ar - wizard command, allowing to rate a weapon

added the ^aV - wizard command, allowing to view the value of something

changed shock-damage back to 5x instead of 3x

allowed 18/*** str & dex priests an extra swing with a mace of disruption

allowed rogues an increased chance of hitting a monster the first-time when
        it's asleep

allowed warriors a better chance of heavy critical hits each 10 levels.
        ie they don't make them ofter, but when they do they always get at least
        a superb hit at level 50, always at least a great hit at level 30

added a flag to get the color-description/titles with identified objects.

allowed scumming for very good levels

wearing rings of accuracy now increases your chances of a critical hit

added the option to quit immediately ^Q

always temporarily suspend the quick_messages status before asking "live on?"
       so pressing return doesn't let you die

in wizard mode, you are not zapped to town, but a new level is generated

drained experience and stats now blue, because yellow/green is not seen clearly

skills-display now includes the numerical values

searching in help-files is now case-independent

now key-pressed necessary while generating caves

added much information about spell effects in wizard mode

scrolls of *remove curse* have a 1 in (55-level chance to
   reverse the curse effects - a ring of damage(-15) {cursed} then
   becomes a ring of damage (+15)
   this does not go for artifacts - a sword of mormegil +40,+60 would
   be somewhat unbalancing

done Gloves of Magic:  magic skill +1d5, (-10,-10) tohit,-dam

increased to amount of mana for really high int/wis characters

added a flag to allow to auto-target the only monster in sight

added wizard command ^aR to reset some things, currently only the maximum
      dungeon level

you hands only feel unsuitable for spell-casting if you have >0 mana

added the possibility for non-cursed items with to_d/h/a/pval >0 and cursed items
with to_d/h/a/pval <0. IE now there are

gloves of magic (-12,-8) (+3 to magic) which increase your magic skill whilst
decreasing your fighting possibilities.

boots of jumping: activate for phase door every 20 turns

boots of heavy step: +10 to AC, -3 to stealth

Create new Artifact:
The Black Spear of Melkor 3d10 (+12,+24) (+4)
60 lb zwaar
affects stealth and infravision
resist darkness. light, blindness, nether, confusion
heavily cursed, and becomes so on wielding it
leads to permanent poisoning (about 2 hp each turn)

This spear was mentioned in the Silmarillion, it's the weapon Melkor used to slay
the trees of Valinor.

add name searching capability to '/' command

made a different screen layout under DOS possible:
Now 28, 35, 40 and 50 lines screen modi are possible, with the extra space taken
by a permanent scrolling message recall

Axe of Hurin: +3 attacks, +3 to con

  wielding 2-handed yields a 1.5 x to_hit and 1.5 x todam, but you can't wield
  a shield then.
  I'm not sure if this should go for artifacts too, for now these can be wielded
  one-handed and two-handed, but I'm not sure.

enlarged dungeon from 66x198 to 110x330 - nice and big!

allow scroll of *enchant* to supercharge damage dice sometimes - you must have
a *enchant* scroll and the have a rand_int(100-level)<20 chance. This won't work
with a priests' enchant prayer.

acid brand weapons dig much more easily - acid eats walls. Perhaps this should
be done by setting TUNNEL in e_info.txt for acid-brand, not by hard-coding.

acid spells now can damage walls.

more items per grid square now possible: up to 16 per square, but it will be
     limited to 4 per square unless really necessary - ie like dropping a great
     lot of items in a narrow spot, or dropping 10 artifacts in one place. If
     possible, dropping the 5th item drops it near you.
     items are stored as indexes into i_list in an array in each cave_type.
     This array is kept sorted, can absorb items like the inventory, and shows
     up correctly during look, pickup, load and save.
     Memory-requirements are up from 6 (8 incl. monster flow) bytes per square
     to 38 bytes per grid.
     With the old dungeon-dimensions, this means from 78408 bytes to 496584
     bytes, with the new dungeon from 217800 to 1379400 bytes. I don't know if
     this is a problem for many angband users. It isn't for me, and I liked to
     look if it would be possible.
     It would perhaps be preferable to have object index arrays only in
     grids which are no walls, or make variable-sized arrays, but the
     programming effort would be great, and speed and clarity of angband
     would suffer.

changed all functions to x,y calling - not y,x calling.

Added a new set of traps:
N:0:Beauty Trap
N:1:Intelligence Trap
N:2:Wisdom Trap
N:3:Fumbling Fingers Trap
N:4:Wasting Trap
N:5:Trap of small Fire Ball
N:6:Trap of Small Ice Ball
N:7:Trap of small Lightning Ball
N:8:Trap of Curse Weapon
N:9:Trap of Curse Armor
N:10:Earthquake Trap
N:11:Poison Needle Trap
N:12:Summon Monster Trap
N:13:Summon Undead Trap
N:14:Summon Greater Undead Trap
N:15:Teleport Trap
N:16:Paralyzing Trap
N:17:Explosive Device
N:18:Teleport Away Trap
N:19:Lose Memory Trap
N:20:Bitter Regret Trap
N:21:Bowel Cramps Trap
N:22:Blindness/Confusion Trap
N:23:Aggravation Trap
N:24:Multiplication Trap
N:25:Large Plasma Ball Trap
N:26:Large Nether Ball Trap
N:27:Large Nexus Ball Trap
N:28:Large Disenchantment Ball Trap
N:29:Weakness Trap
N:30:Steal Item Trap
N:31:Summon Fast Quylthulgs Trap
N:32:Trap of Acid Bolt
N:33:Large Acid Ball Trap
N:34:Trap of Sinking
N:35:Trap of Mana Drain
N:36:Trap of Missing Money
N:37:Trap of No Return
N:38:Trap of Silent Switching
N:39:Trap of Walls
N:40:Trap of Calling Out
N:41:Trap of Sliding
N:42:Trap of Charges Drain
N:43:Trap of Stair Movement
N:44:Trap of New Trap
N:45:Trap of Scatter Items
N:46:Trap of Decay
N:47:Trap of Wasting Wands

Traps can now be present on floor, doors and chests. More than one trap per item
is possible. Traps have a minimum level, a probability of being on an item, and
a probability of having another trap present. Some traps are very nice, like
the trap of scatter items, or stair movement. Traps that are known are colored
on screen.
The trap of sliding is featured after a nice level in Adom.
Traps are now organised as different trap types, in t_info[] like monster types
in r_info[], and trap_items, sets of traps that exist on floors/doors/chests.

Disarming and opening is now more intuitive, uses less keys and works better.

copied the lighting from angband 2.8.0

copied the extra info screens from angband 2.8.1

copied the new max hitpoints/manapoints stuff from 2.8.1

added weight modifier (like parts out of 100 normal weight) to ego-items, so
that armor of elvenkind can weigh less (25% of normal), just like we now have
armor of quality (+15 AC, 180% weight, -10 to hit), the helmet of crushing
(+10 AC, +500% weight)

activate chest trap(s) when picking up a chest

save levels - no more random levels each time, which is more in line with
the original idea I think. If this means the dungeon is getting too small,
then each floor should be bigger, or there should be more floors. levels are
saved as player.l00 to player.l7f in the save directory.
something should be done about returning to a level after a long time: monsters
should have moved, picked up things, etc. However, this is difficult in a
turn-based RPG. Calling process_monsters seems nice, but how to avoid attacking
the player?

removed all to code to convert old savefiles - savefiles are now so different
that is just doesn't make sense!

stairs now don't automatically lead to the next level, you can go from level 2
to level 4, or from level 90 to 87. If you go from say level 1 to level 4, then
return, the program tries to return you to a stairway which leads to level 4.
If there are more, you land on a random one. If there are none, one is made.
If you don't use a stair, you don't land on one, either.

there is now an arena to the right of town - but the earning may not keep up
with the trouble! because of this and other future plans, the ftyp entry in
cave_type was bumped up to 16 bits, fdat to 32, and an extra field of 16 bits
was added - I'm not so shy of using memory and/or diskspace.

The arena now has public (hidden behind permanent glass walls) and visiting
too often seems to get your maximum betting amount down.....

cave_type and f_info totally reorganised - lots of changes in defines.h,
f_info.txt and init?.c - the cave_type is now organised along the lines of
the items, with main types (floor, wall, door etc) and subtypes (normal floor,
floor with trap, etc) - this is not a nice job, but I think it will allow
the adding of other floor types (wilderness, water, whatever) more easily.
For example: the permanent glass wall separating the crowds in the arena from
the arena itself was added with just two lines in f_info.txt, defining a
subtype of permanent walls which let through light, but where you can't walk.

added wilderness - trees are something you could pass beneath, but not see past.
items should only be remembered there (this is not working as of yet)
perhaps the overall remembrance of squares should be dependant on something;
******************************************************************************
TODO

online (de)compression of save-files, which saves a lot of space, and prevents
anyone from tampering

predefined levels in text-mode files.

more different ego-weapons

monster inventories
Give monsters things like hands (1-4), flags for
- can wear armour + max level
NO: add item-stacks, which can be used for piles on floor, monster inventories,
  and eventually backpacks of different sizes.
let's say that c_ptr->i_idx<MAX_I_IDX points to i_list directly, and that
c_ptr->i_idx>=MAX_I_IDX points to an array[0.. 4/8/16 perhaps] of indexes into
i_list.

Add ego-items:

weapon of joy: resist fear, slay undead, +1d3 chr

shield of the Dwarves: +1d3 infravison +1d3 con, resist fire

Helm of the Noldor: +1d3 dex, activate for find treasure every 20 turns

make monster wake-up chance dependant on light radius = intensity

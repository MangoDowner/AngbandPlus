- Improved monster AI.
- Increased the maximum number of vaults to 64.
- Very high or low speed modifiers no longer cause problems.
- Entry into debug, wizard, or borg mode is only confirmed once per

  altered.

  Thuringwethil, Omarax, Qlzqqlzuup, and Feagwath can now summon similar

- Objects carried by monsters are now loaded properly.
- A command to repeat the last command has been added ('n' in original,
  ''' in roguelike keyset).
- At character creation, some extra difficulty options are
  available (no artifacts, no stores, no up stairs/recall).
- The "special" inscriptions ("cursed", "worthless", "good", ...) are
  now handled outside the normal inscription system, and so neither
  overwrite, nor are overwritten by, normal inscriptions.
- Made destroyed levels rarer.
- The quest monsters (Sauron and Morgoth) are now always generated on
  levels 99 and 100.
- Fixed a bug in the "know complete monster info" cheat option.

Compilation changes:
- Added a compile.txt file with compile guides for various systems and
  compilers.
- Added a makefile for the free Borland C++ 5.5 compiler.
- Removed lots of compiler warnings.
- Fixed a problem when compiling Angband on newer (glibc-based) Linux
  systems.
- Added a compile-time option to allow players to put an .angband.prf
  file in their home directory and have it read on systems where
  Angband is running set-[ug]id.  Default is off.
- Added support for compiling a Linux SVGALIB version with graphics.
- Added support for the use of the 8x8 and 16x16 tiles in the X11
  version.

Windows specific changes:
- You can select between the "old" tiles, the new tiles, and ASCII mode.
- The Windows version no longer requires changes to angband.ini when
  installing.  The angband.ini file will be created when you first start
  the program, so it doesn't need to be present in the binary archive.
  That also allows easy updates to newer versions, since the settings
  in the angband.ini are not overwritten when installing a new version
  over an old one.
- The windows can be resized and the (graphical) tiles will adjust
  automatically to the new size.
- Added the "Show scores" command to the menu.
- Fixed a bug that created all files as "read-only" (causing the game to
  fail when saving the game).
- Fixed a bug that caused all numbers to be registered twice by the game,
  leading to "double-steps".
- Fixed a bug that didn't free the used bitmaps correctly when closing
  the game.

DOS-specific changes:
- Graphics, sounds, and music options
  You can switch the graphics/music/sound options from the user menu
  (press ! to get there).  The volume of the sound and the music can be
  adjusted from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  All changes to the screen-resolution
  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.
- Sound Events
  DOS-Angband will play samples from the "lib/xtra/sound" folder to the
  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.  Multiple sounds per event are
  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').

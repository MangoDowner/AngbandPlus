HIGH ELF
----------

High Elves are the elder, immortal cousins of the elves
who lives for a very, very long time. Their knowledge is very
high, and their eternal life span allowed them to master
all the skills available to them. Therefore, unlike normal
elves, they receive a bonus to all skills. However, because
their knowledge is already pretty high, they tend to learn
skills slower than the regular elves.

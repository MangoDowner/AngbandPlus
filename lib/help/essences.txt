#####R------------------------

Essences are the tools of the trade for Alchemists, and unfortunately are 
useless for any other class. Alchemists use essences to create magical items 
for them to use. 

They can be either found on the floor while exploring the  dungeon, or 
extracted from other magical items the alchemist finds during their adventures.

To create an artifact, the alchemist will have to sacrifice 10 hit point, and an 
amount of magic essence similar to his skill in alchemy. The alchemist then 
allows the artifact to gain experience, and when it has enough, uses that 
experience to add abilities to the artifact. The alchemist can allow the 
artifact to continue to gain experience, thus keeping open the option to add 
more abilities later. This requires a similar amount of magic essence, but does 
not require the sacrifice of another hit point.

Note that the experience you gain is divided among the  artifacts that you have 
as well as going to yourself, so you will gain levels more slowly when 
empowering artifacts. Also, the artifact only gets 60% of the experience. So  
killing a creature worth 20xp would gain 10 for you, and 6 for the artifact.

You can also modify existing artifacts when you attain level 50. Also at level 
50 you will gain the ability to make temporary artifacts, which don't require 
the complex empowerments that regular items require, but also vanish after 
awhile.

You cannot give an artifact an ability unless you have *Identified* an artifact 
which has that ability.

For every four levels gained in the alchemy skill, the alchemist learns about 
objects of level level/4, starting by learning about level 1 objects at skill 
level 0.  (actually 1, but who's counting?)

At level 5 you gain the ability to make ego items - but watch it! Your base 
failure rate will be 90%, and won't be 0% until you reach level 50. Adding gold 
will  increase the chances of success in direct perportion to the value of the 
item you are trying to create. Note that this results in automatic success when 
the item you are trying to create happens to pick up a curse in the process.

At level 5 you also gain knowledge of some basic ego item recipes. These are: 
Shocking, Fiery, Frozen,  Venomous, and chaotic weapons, Resist fire armor, and 
lite of boldness.

At level 10 you will gain knowledge of digging ego items, if you have selected 
the option 'always  generate very unusual rooms' (ironman_rooms) 

At level 15 you can create ego wands, staves, rings, etc.

At level 25 You gain the ability to empower artifacts.

At level 50 You gain the ability to create temporary artifacts, which don't 
require any exotic ingredients beyond a single corpse of any type.

Between levels 25 and 50, you will steadily gain the ability to set more and 
more flags.

To finalize an artifact, you 'P'ower it, and select the powers you want. Powers 
are divided into the following five catagories:
*****essences.txt*01[Stats, Sustains, luck, speed, vision, etc.]
*****essences.txt*02[Misc. (Auras, light, see invis, etc)]
*****essences.txt*03[Weapon Branding]
*****essences.txt*04[Resistances and immunities]
*****essences.txt*05[ESP and curses]

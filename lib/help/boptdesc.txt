=========================== Character Birth Options ===========================

Certain options must be set during or before character creation.  If
they are changed for an existing character, there is no effect except
to change the default for that character's descendants.

Other option sets are described in their own documentation file.

=== Option Set 5 -- Birth Options ===

     Point Based (Default -  OFF):

         Point based character creation allows you to skip 'rolling
         for stats' altogether.  Instead you have a limited number of
         points with which you can 'buy' points in various stats.
         Higher stats cost much more than lower ones.  Leftover points
         are converted into extra starting money.

     Auto Roller (Default -  OFF):

         If you do not use point based character creation, this option
         will allow you to specify minimum stats.  Characters are
         generated until one is found to meet your requirements.

         Stats are linked in the rolling process, so that each high
         stat makes the next one less likely to be very high.  It may
         be impossible to generate a character with multiple high
         stats specified.

     Preserve (Default -  OFF):

         Selecting Preserve mode makes it possible for artifacts to reappear
         if generated but not discovered, but eliminates all the handy 
         "special"  feelings (see the help file "wild-dun.txt").  In 
         FAangband, preserve mode can be problematic, as it is often hard to 
         clear an entire wilderness level.

     Character Notes (Default - ON):

	 Record all the main life milestones of your character automatically 
	 in a notes file.  If selected, the notes file can be viewed from the
	 '~' knowledge menu, and will appear in character dumps.

     Notes in save directory (Default - OFF):

         Keep the temporary notes file in the savefile directory.  This option
	 may be necessary when the user does not have full write priveleges to
	 the usual temporary file directory.  Turn it on if the game is giving
	 you notes file errors.

=== Window Options ===

Some platforms support "sub-windows", which are windows which can be used to display useful information generally available through other means. This screen governs their contents.

There are two letters (numbers if rogue_like_commands is set) associated with each display for each window. The first controls how important that display is when something happens to it, the second how important it is otherwise, with later numbers/letters being better, and space being worst of all. In addition, displays are never shown if they contain no information (e.g. a blank screen).

A more detailed description of the algorithm is at the bottom of this file. For now, I'll detail the options available:

=== Option list ===

%%%%% <Display inventory>
$GDisplay inventory (boring if you have no unequipped inventory)
Displays your inventory list (as the 'i' command).

%%%%% <Display equipment>
$GDisplay equipment (boring if you have nothing equipped)
Displays your equipment list (as in the 'e' command).

%%%%% <Display spell list>
$GDisplay spell list (never boring)
Displays the mindcrafting powers at your disposal.

%%%%% <Display character>
$GDisplay character (never boring)
Displays the character screen (as the 'C' command).

%%%%% <Display nearby monsters>
$GDisplay nearby monsters (boring if none are nearby)
Displays a list of the monsters nearby with the default symbol for each type of monster, coloured based on whether the monster is unique, whether it is normally found at deeper levels than the current one, and whether the save file contains any record of kills of a similar monster.

%%%%% <Display skills>
$GDisplay skills (never boring)
Displays the skill page of the character screen (as 'Chh').

%%%%% <Display messages>
$GDisplay messages (never boring)
Displays the last page of messages (as the 'Ctrl+P' command).
    
%%%%% <Display overhead view>
$GDisplay overhead view (boring on 1x1 levels)
Displays a representation of the whole level which removes some (hopefully unnecessary) information to be able to fit.

%%%%% <Display monster recall>
$GDisplay monster recall
Displays a description of the most recent monster to be attacked, targetted or examined in some way. It is boring if this has never happened to a monster since the program was started.

%%%%% <Display object recall>
$GDisplay object recall
Display the contents of the most recent spellbook to be selected. It is boring if none have been.

%%%%% <Display object details>
$GDisplay object details
Display information (as obtained with 'I') about the last object to be selected. It is boring if none have been, or if the last object to be selected has been destroyed.

%%%%% <Display shop names>
$GDisplay shop names (boring except in towns with shops)
Display information (as obtained with '~8') about the shops in the current town.

%%%%% <Display floor information>
$GDisplay floor information (boring if the player can't see the floor)
Display a description of the floor the player is standing on, as well as a 
(usually complete) list of objects on it.

%%%%% <Display help>
$GDisplay help (boring if none available)
Display a short piece of potentially helpful text which is relevant to whatever you are doing at the time.

As mentioned above, the game prefers non-"boring" displays, and prefers displays which the player has given a higher priority to. In addition, it doesn't consider displays with no priority at all (chosen by pressing space in both keysets) under any circumstances.

If two displays are equally important and are equally interesting, the game will display whichever is changing if only one is. If neither or both are, it continues to display the current display if that is one of the two displays, and makes an arbitrary choice otherwise.

This, then is a flow chart of its decision process for display PW_PLAYER on display 1.

1. Is it being triggered (usually only when being changed) now?
   If so, set its priority to the first letter in its preferences entry.
   If not, set it to the second.
2. Is it "boring"?
   If so (not actually possible here) don't display this one.
   If not, continue to 3.
3. Does another display have a higher priority?
   If so, don't display this one.
   If not, continue to 4.
4. Does another display have an equal priority?
   If not, display this one.
   If so, continue to 5.
5. Is this display changing?
   If so, continue to 6.
   If not, go to 7.
6. Is another non-boring display with the same priority also changing?
   If so, go to 8.
   If not, display PW_PLAYER.
7. Is another non-boring display with the same priority changing?
   If so, display that display.
   If not, continue to 8.
8. Was this already being displayed?
   If so, display this one.
   If not, continue to 9.
9. Was any display which could get as far as 8 already being displayed?
   If so, display that one.
   If not, display an arbitrary display.

As an example, I have the following display priorities set in the two extra windows I have open:

One has:
Nearby monsters = cc
Skills = aa
Overhead view = bb
Monster recall = d
Object recall = d
Object details = d

The other has:
Skills = ca
Messages = ba
Shop names = da
Help = aa

Note that at least one of the displays in each window ("Skills" in the first, both "Skills" and "Messages" in the second) is never boring.

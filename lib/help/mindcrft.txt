Mindcrafting (WIS-based)
========================

The power of mindcrafting is one of the magical powers available in Cthangband. Mindcrafting involves using your natural energy (called 'Chi') to perform actions.

Although mindcrafting may look at first glance to be one of the simplest forms of magic due to the limited number of powers that can be used, it is not very easy to pick up and only those with a strong mind (a high WIS) will find it worth the effort.

Requirements
============

Mindcrafting is unique amongst the forms of magic in that there is no requirement in the form of material goods or learning. It can be entirely learned by practice and needs no outside help. However, wearing most forms of head covering will interfere with your mindcrafting abilities and reduce the chi that you are able to use effectively.

Usage
=====

You can use mindcrafting powers at any time except when in a shop. Press the '<shift>P' key (control-M in the roguelike keyset) to use a power,  and then select which power to use.  You will be unable to use  mindcrafting powers while confused.

If you use a capital letter when selecting a power, the game will print a confirmation prompt and display information about what this power does at your current skill level.

Abilities
=========

Whilst mindcrafting has fewer abilities available to it than most other forms of magic, it makes up for this easily in the increase in power level each ability has when the mindcrafter gets more skilled. The abilities are listed below along with the minimum skill required for use and the chi cost. While it is possible to attempt a mindcrafting ability without having enough chi left, it is not advisable.

Neural Blast (2% Skill, 1 Chi)
This skill fires a blast of mental energy at a creature or location, doing damage based on your mindcrafting skill. There is a chance (based on your skill) that this blast will affect an area around the targetted creature or location.

This does not, however, affect monsters which are invisible to telepathy, and has little effect on animals or other stupid things, or on creatures which are rarely found through telepathy. In addition, high level monsters may resist and
undead and demons may even cause harm to the caster.

Minor Displacement (6% Skill, 2 Chi)
This power teleports you a short distance. If you have 50% skill or more, then you are able to choose your destination.

Major Displacement (14% Skill, 6 Chi)
This power teleports you long distance in a random direction. If you have 60% skill or more then it will also teleport any other creatures that are near you in a random direction.

Domination (18% Skill, 7 Chi)
This power will charm creatures into becoming your allies. At lower levels of skill you will only be able to charm a single creature, but at 60% skill or more you will be able to charm a whole group of creatures.

Pulverise (22% Skill, 7 Chi)
This power sets up a telekinetic vibration that will manifest itself in the form of a damaging ball of sound energy that appears in a location you choose.

This power always provides a temporary boost to your armour class.
From 30% skill, it also grants temporary acid resistance.

At 80%-100% skill this power will fully identify an item.

Mind Wave (36% Skill, 10 Chi)
This power tries to kill monsters by directly attacking their minds. It has similar weaknesses to Neural Blast above.
At first, it only affects monsters which are near to you.
From 50% skill, it attempts to harm every monster you can see.

Adrenaline Channeling (46% Skill, 15 Chi)
This power clears your mind from pain, curing you from fear and stunning (as well as recovering some hit points). It also hastes you for a period of time.
At low skill levels it also makes you heroic, but from 70% skill, it turns you berserk instead.

Psychic Drain (50% Skill, 10 Chi)
This power sends out a ball of disruption (subject to similar restrictions to Neural Blast and Mind Wave) which channels the chi of other creatures that it hits. You absorb some of this chi back.

Telekinetic Wave (58% Skill, 20 Chi)
This power sends out a large telekinetic ball of force centred on yourself and spreading outwards, harming every monster it hits.

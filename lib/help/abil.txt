ABILITIES
-----------

In NewAngband 1.1.0(you may not have played this version for long...),
class abilties were introduced to the game. However, documentation is
missing for them, so here it is.

WHAT IS A CLASS ABILITY?
--------------------------
A class ability is a power you can gain from a class. Each characters
got ability points(AP). During the game, you may press 'J' to get access
to the abilities your character can gain. The choice depend on which
class you play. If you have enough ability points, you may purchase
abilities.

HOW DOES ABILITIES WORK
-------------------------
Once purchased, the selected ability will appear as an item in your
inventory. Just equip it as you would equip a sword. You may equip up
to two abilities. Once equipped, you will gain access to their power.
It's as simple as that! :)

HOW DO I GAIN ABILITY POINTS?
-------------------------------
You gain ability points by killing monsters. When you kill a monster,
the amount of AP you receive is equal to the experience value of the
monster divided by three(so if the monster is worth 300 exp, you will
gain 100 AP).

CAN I LOSE ABILITIES?
-----------------------
Unless you voluntary drop them on the ground, no. They are indestructible,
eternal items.

TIPS AND TRICKS
-----------------
- The Warrior ability "Weapon Mastery" allow any class to perform with any
weapons.
- The mage's "Mana +30" will allow any class to get spell points.
- "Monster Magics" are useful when you have a lot of hp...
- Stats boosting abilities are useful for changing into classes you can't
have yet.
- "Wraith Form" has the same effect as the expensive ring of Wraith Form.

#####R=== Blade ===

#####GDescription

Blades are trained as living weapons. They fight with their bare hands, and do
a significant amount of damage; however, they cannot wield any sort of weapon,
and have only one (powerful) blow per round.

Blades have a chance of dodging any melee attack, and, to a lesser extent, some
forms of magic (bolts, balls, and breaths, but not spells that specifically
target him such as curses). Armor and encumbrance both reduce his ability to
dodge.

#####GPrimary Stats

Strength
Dexterity
(Both feed into his combat abilities.)
Constitution

#####GMagic Usage
While a Blade cannot use magic, he may invoke The Rush, an ability that
enhances their speed, combat ability, and gives them the off chance of
temporary ESP.

The price of this is that a Blade, at the end of The Rush, goes into The Bust,
which paralyzes him for a few turns (ignoring Free Action), and then slows him.

#####GStarting Equipment
None

BALROG
--------

Balrogs are demons from the underworld. Tall, strong, smart,
ferocious and feared by all, these merciless spawn of evil
are more than a match for most other races. However, all they
care about is destruction and chaos, and thus their 
charisma greatly suffers. Furthermore, because they have
lived for thousands of years, have already very powerful
natural abilities and because they have very little to learn,
experience is extremely hard for them to gain.

#####R=== Half-Ogres ===

#####GDescription
Half-Ogres are like Half-Orcs, but only more so. They are big, bad, and 
stupid. For warriors, they have all the necessary attributes, and they can
even become wizards: after all, they are related to Ogre Magi, from whom 
they have learned the skill of setting trapped runes once their level is 
high enough. Like Half-Orcs, they resist darkness, and like Trolls, 
they have their strength sustained.

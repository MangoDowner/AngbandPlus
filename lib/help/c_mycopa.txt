#####R=== Mycoparasitologists ===

#####GDescription
Mycoparasitologists are strange hermits who have spent years in tropical
jungles.  These experiences, combined with certain magic spells, give them
terrifying command over molds, mushrooms, and parasites.  They gain experience
with parasites and eventually can cause parasite eggs to hatch into parasites
they have studied.  They must infest most monsters in a level in 1000 to 2000
turns, however, as their eggs will hatch in about that time and infest the 
handiest target, which may well be themselves.

=== Birth/Difficulty options ===

Birth options are a special set of options, that only take effect if modified 
during the creation of a character (they are also the only options that can be
modified during the creation of a character). Once the character is created, 
the birth options are set and modifications will only affect the next 
character created using the same savefile.

Birth options are divided into three sub-sets - 

==== Sub-Set 1 - Birth options ====

These are options that directly affect the creation of a character.

***** <birth_point_based>
Allow purchase of stats using points [birth_point_based]
    Allows the player to determine exactly what stats the character will 
    start with, but will lead to creation of weaker characters than by other 
    methods.

***** <birth_auto_roller>
Allow specification of minimal stats    [birth_auto_roller]
    If point based creation is turned off, this allows the player to set 
    minimum stats (within reason) and ask the game to keep on rolling until a 
    character with the desired stats is generated. Using this method can lead 
    to better characters than point-based creation, but totally random rolling
    can create even better ones (though rarely). 

***** <birth_random_hp>
Generate hitpoints randomly [birth_random_hp]
    If this option is turned on, the amount of hit points gained with each 
    level will be randomly determined from a range determined by the class and
    race of the character. If this option is turned off, the character will 
    always be exactly middle-of-the-range. Random hitpoints allow for more 
    variation and a chance for higher hit points, but bear the risk of gaining
    fewer hit points as well.

***** <birth_start_kit>
Pre-Shop for some basic items [birth_start_kit]
    The character starts with a lantern, 4 oil flasks, a scroll of phase door,
    a cloak, and a potion of cure light wounds. On the other hand he starts 
    with 100 gold less than without this option and no torches. Using this 
    option allows you to save the tedium of early shopping but gives you a bad
    deal gold-wise.

==== Sub-Set 2 - Difficulty options ====

These are options that influence the difficulty of the game. Changing any of
these can result in a considerably different playing experience.

***** <birth_easy_mode>
Easy mode    [birth_esay_mode]
    If you wish to have an easier job, select this option and you shall face
    monsters with less hitpoints. In addition, you will get better prices at 
    shops and get an extra 500 GP at the start of the game.

***** <birth_autoscum>
Generate better (harder) levels    [birth_autoscum]
    Allows you to force the generation of "good" levels in the dungeon.  
    This option may be extremely slow on some machines, especially deep in
    the dungeon.  The minimum "goodness" of the level is based on the 
    dungeon level, so the deeper you go, the better the level will be. 
    Note that better levels also include tougher monsters so this makes the
    game both more challanging and more rewarding.

***** <birth_preserve>
Preserve artifacts on leaving level    [birth_preserve]
    If preserve mode is "off", you can get a level feeling that you *NEVER*
    get with preserve mode "on": a "special" feeling. This means that there 
    is an artifact, a pit or a vault on the level: and while a pit or vault
    may not necessarily cause a special feeling, an artifact CERTAINLY will.
    This is principally of use in finding out which levels are *not* 
    "special", i.e. which ones can be left in a hurry without worrying 
    about leaving something behind - if it's not "special", there is no 
    artifact unless a monster has dropped one when you killed it. This is 
    particularly important because, with preserve mode off, no artifact can
    be generated more than once in the game. If it's on a level and you miss
    it, it's gone forever. With preserve mode "on", if you miss an artifact, 
    it can turn up later provided you didn't pick it up and identify it 
    the first time (in which case there is no excuse for losing it.) But 
    you don't get the "special" feeling. 

***** <birth_rand_artifacts>
Randomize some of the artifacts    [birth_rand_artifacts]
    A different set of artifacts will be created, in place of the standard 
    ones from a_info.txt/a_info.raw. This is intended primarily for people
    who have played enough to know what most of the standard artifacts do
    and have got bored with them. 

***** <birth_ironman>
Restrict the use of stairs/recall    [birth_ironman]
    This option, not recommended for non-advanced players, prevents the 
    generation of up staircases, and makes the scroll and effect of Word 
    of Recall not function: and teleport-level always goes down, as does 
    the spell of stair-creation, except on the quest levels of Sauron and 
    Morgoth.

***** <birth_no_stores>
Restrict the use of stores/home    [birth_no_stores]
    The stores are all closed. The home is someone else's, and locked. You 
    can keep nothing but what you carry with you, and get nothing but what 
    you find in the dungeon. No selling items, or buying potions of 
    restore stat... Not recommended for new players, or indeed for 
    sane players.

***** <birth_no_feelings>
No level feelings [birth_no_feelings]
    You will no longer get a descriptive feeling when entering a level - 
    you'll have to explore it yourself to discover what it contains, with
    no prior warning. Recommended only for advanced players.

***** <birth_no_artifacts>
Restrict the creation of artifacts    [birth_no_artifacts]
    No artifacts will be created. Ever. Just *how* masochistic are you?

***** <birth_force_small_lev>
All levels will be generated as small    [birth_force_small_lev]
    All levels will be generated as small levels, giving you less space
    to run to...

==== Sub-Set 3 - Monster AI options ====

These are options that influence the behvaiour patterns of monsters. Changing
these may influence what strategies and tactics will work best against your
opponents. (note to those familiar with other varients - EyAngband monsters
always use basic AI to determine spell choices).

***** <birth_smart_packs>
Monsters act smarter in groups    [birth_smart_packs]
     "group" monsters will use tactics that groups of monsters might 
     reasonably employ - such as hiding out of sight around a corner, 
     trying to draw the character out into the middle of a room so they 
     can surround him and all attack at once, rather than chasing one
     by one down a corridor.

***** <birth_smart_cheat>
Monsters exploit players weaknesses    [birth_smart_cheat]
    Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant tom, without
    having to make mistakes (normally, a monster will learn this information
    by casting spells and remembering their effectiveness).

***** <birth_flow_by_sound>
Monsters chase current location    [birth_flow_by_sound]
    Allow monsters to make paths to the player when they are nearby.  This
    option may be extremely slow on older machines, but can produce viciously
    smart monsters.

***** <birth_flow_by_smell>
Monsters chase recent locations    [birth_flow_by_smell]
    Allow monsters to take advantage of "old" trails that you may have left
    in the dungeon.  This has no effect unless "flow_by_sound" is also set.

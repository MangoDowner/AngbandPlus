=== Birth/Difficulty options ===

Birth options are a special set of options, that only take effect if modified 
during the creation of a character (they are also the only options that can be
modified during the creation of a character). Once the character is created, 
the birth options are set and modifications will only affect the next character
created using the same savefile.

Birth options are divided into three sub-sets - 

==== Sub-Set 1 - Birth options ====

These are options that directly affect the creation of a character. 

***** <birth_point_based>
Allow purchase of stats using points [birth_point_based] (default: no)
    Allows the player to determine exactly what stats the character will start
    with, but the overall sum of all stats will be lower than those which could
    potentially be generated by other methods.  Note that this option is 
    incompatible with the auto-roller and the weighted roller.

***** <birth_auto_roller>
Allow specification of minimal stats [birth_auto_roller] (default: no)
    This allows the player to set minimum stats (within reason) and ask the 
    game to keep on rolling until a character with the desired stats is 
    generated. Using this method can lead to better characters than 
    point-based creation.  Note that this option is incompatible with point-
    based creation and the weighted roller.

***** <birth_weighted_roller>
Allow specification of stat weighings [birth_weighted_roller] (default: yes)
    This allows the player to set weighings for the various stats ask the game
    to keep on rolling until a character with appropriate stats is generated. 
    Like the auto roller, using this method can lead to better characters than 
    point-based creation.  Note that this option is incompatible with point-
    based creation and the auto-roller.

***** <birth_random_hp>
Generate hitpoints randomly [birth_random_hp] (default: yes)
    If this option is turned on, the amount of hit points gained with each 
    level will be randomly determined from a range determined by the class and
    race of the character. If this option is turned off, the character will 
    always be exactly middle-of-the-range. Random hitpoints allow for more 
    variation and a chance for higher hit points, but bear the risk of gaining
    fewer hit points as well.

***** <birth_start_kit>
Pre-Shop for some basic items [birth_start_kit] (default: no)
    The character starts with a lantern, 5 oil flasks, a scroll of phase door,
    a cloak, and a potion of cure light wounds. On the other hand he starts 
    with 50 gold less than without this option and no torches. Using this 
    option allows you to save the tedium of early shopping but gives you a poor
    deal gold-wise.

***** <birth_retain_squelch>
Retain squelch settings [birth_retain_squelch] (default: no)
    If this option is set, the new character will keep the squelch settings of
    his immediate ancestor. If it is not set, the character's squelch settings
    will revert to the defaults.

==== Sub-Set 2 - Difficulty options ====

These are options that influence the difficulty of the game. Changing any of
these can result in a considerably different playing experience.

***** <birth_easy_mode>
Easy mode [birth_easy_mode] (default: no)
    If you wish to have an easier job, select this option and you shall face
    monsters with less hitpoints. In addition, you will get better prices at 
    shops and get an extra 200 GP at the start of the game. You will also get
    easier quests, and other bonuses.

***** <birth_nightmare_mode>
Nightmare mode [birth_nightmare_mode] (default: no)
    Not for the faint of heart, this makes you game harder in many ways.

***** <birth_autoscum>
Generate better (harder) levels [birth_autoscum] (default: no)
    Allows you to force the generation of "good" levels in the dungeon.  This
    option may slow down dungeon generation on some machines, especially deep
    in the dungeon.  The minimum "goodness" of the level is based on the 
    dungeon level, so the deeper you go, the better the level will be.  Note
    that better levels also include tougher monsters so this makes the game
    both more challanging and more rewarding.

***** <birth_preserve>
Preserve artifacts on leaving level [birth_preserve] (default: yes)
    If preserve mode is "off", you can get a level feeling that you *NEVER*
    get with preserve mode "on": a "special" feeling. This means that there 
    is an artifact, a pit or a vault on the level: and while a pit or vault
    may not necessarily cause a special feeling, an artifact CERTAINLY will.
    This is principally of use in finding out which levels are *not* "special",
    i.e. which ones can be left in a hurry without worrying  about leaving 
    something behind - if it's not "special", there is no artifact unless a 
    monster has dropped one when you killed it. This is particularly important
    because, with preserve mode off, no artifact can be generated more than 
    once in the game. If it's on a level and you miss it, it's gone forever.
    With preserve mode "on", if you miss an artifact, it can turn up later 
    provided you didn't pick it up and identify it the first time (in which 
    case there is no excuse for losing it.) But you don't get the "special" 
    feeling. 

***** <birth_ironman>
Restrict the use of stairs/recall [birth_ironman] (default: no)
    This option, not recommended for non-advanced players, prevents the 
    generation of up staircases, and makes the scroll and effect of Word of
    Recall not function: and teleport-level always goes down, as does the spell
    of stair-creation, except on the quest levels of Sauron and Morgoth.

***** <birth_no_stores>
Restrict the use of stores/home [birth_no_stores] (default: no)
    The stores are all closed.  The home is someone else's, and locked.  You
    can keep nothing but what you carry with you, and get nothing but what you
    find in the dungeon.  No selling items, or buying potions of restore stat.
    This option also prevents the use of the adventurer's guild. Not 
    recommended for new players, or indeed for sane players.

***** <birth_no_feelings>
No level feelings [birth_no_feelings] (default: no)
    You will no longer get a descriptive feeling when entering a level - you'll
    have to explore it yourself to discover what it contains, with no prior 
    warning. Recommended only for advanced players.

***** <birth_no_artifacts>
Restrict the creation of artifacts [birth_no_artifacts] (default: no)
    No artifacts will be created. Ever. Just *how* masochistic are you?

***** <birth_force_small_lev>
All levels will be generated as small [birth_force_small_lev] (default: yes)
    All levels will be generated as small levels, giving you less space to 
    which you can run... Note that FayAngband is designed to be played with
    small levels. Turning this option off will likely result in a boring game.

==== Sub-Set 3 - Monster AI options ====

These are options that influence the behvaiour patterns of monsters. Changing
these may influence what strategies and tactics will work best against your
opponents. (note to those familiar with other variants - EyAngband monsters
always use basic AI to determine spell choices).

***** <birth_smart_packs>
Monsters act smarter in groups [birth_smart_packs] (default: no)
    "group" monsters will use tactics that groups of monsters might reasonably
    employ - such as hiding out of sight around a corner, trying to draw the 
    character out into the middle of a room so they can surround him and all 
    attack at once, rather than chasing one by one down a corridor.

***** <birth_smart_cheat>
Monsters exploit players weaknesses [birth_smart_cheat] (default: no)
    Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, without
    having to make mistakes (normally, a monster will learn this information
    by casting spells and remembering their effectiveness).

***** <birth_flow_by_sound>
Monsters chase current location [birth_flow_by_sound] (default: yes)
    Allow monsters to make paths to the player when they are nearby. This 
    option may be extremely slow on older machines, but can produce viciously
    smart monsters.

***** <birth_flow_by_smell>
Monsters chase recent locations [birth_flow_by_smell] (default: yes)
    Allow monsters to take advantage of "old" trails that you may have left
    in the dungeon.  This has no effect unless "flow_by_sound" is also set.

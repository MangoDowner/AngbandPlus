#####R=== Rogues ===

#####GDescription
A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by cunning, but is capable 
of fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and 
locks, no device is impossible for him to overcome. A rogue will learn 
to set many kinds of traps as they become more experienced. Rogues have
high stealth, allowing them to sneak around many creatures without 
having to fight, or to sneak up and get the first blow. A rogue's
perception is higher than any other class, and usually they notice 
traps or secret doors without needing a search. Rogues are better than 
warriors or paladins with magical devices, but still can not rely on 
their performance. Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the 
powerful offensive spells magi can use. 
               
#####GPrimary Stats
Intelligence (spellcasting stat)
Dexterity.

#####GMagic Usage
Rogues can choose one realm of magic and learn all spells in the first 
four books.

Rogues have the option of choosing one of the following realms of magic:
*****m_magery.txt*0[Magery]   *****m_shadow.txt*0[Shadow]   *****m_nether.txt*0[Nether]   *****m_illus.txt*0[Illusion]   *****m_spirit.txt*0[Spirit]   *****m_sigald.txt*0[Sigaldry]

Rogues are not expert spellcrafters,  but may nevertheless learn some 
minor magicks. Rogues  can  learn  24 spells.

In addition to their magic, rogues are also *thieves*. They are capable of
stealing items from monsters (using the "Z" command), and get a boosted 
chance of success when trying to steal from shops. Each successful attempt
earns them some experience (and the object they stole, of course!).

Finally, rogues do not have to always fight monsters directly - they are
capable of laying traps in the dungeon to lure monsters into. To do this, 
they need a trapping kit and trigger, and use the "U" command to lay the 
trap.

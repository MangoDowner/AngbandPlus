#####R=== Chaos Warriors ===

#####GDescription
Chaos Warriors are the feared servants of the terrible Demon Lords of
Chaos. Every Chaos Warrior has a Patron Demon, such as Arioch, Mabelode
or Balaan. Whenever Chaos Warriors advances a level, their Patron Demon
may reward them with a Gift of Chaos: healing or a new form, an 
increase in stats or a new, powerful weapon. However, Patron Demons are
fickle; they might, depending on their mood, frown, surrounding them
with monsters, drain stats or wreck equipment. Or, they might simply do
nothing. The exact reward depends on the Patron Demon Lord (different 
Demons give different rewards) as well as their fickle moods. Chaos 
Warriors are very good fighters, but they are also trained in Chaos 
magic.

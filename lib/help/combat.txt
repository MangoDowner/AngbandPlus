
====== Non-magical Combat ======

     Without using magic, you may attack monsters in hand-to-hand (melee)
combat, by using missile weapons, or by throwing things at them.

--- Melee ---

     If you are barehanded, you do a small amount of damage, depending on
strength.  If you are using a weapon, things are a bit different.

Basic Calculation:
     1) roll the weapon's damage dice
     2) multiply them by (100% + damage modifier)
     3) apply any critical hit bonuses
     4) repeat for all the blows you get
     
The damage modifier is based on your strength and is increased by magic
weapons and some special magic armours. Unlike other *bands, it is expressed
as a percentile - i.e. a 200% damage modifier means you do triple the
base dice role. You can see this percentile by pressing 'C'. You'll notice
that at first it increases fast, but when it gets higher, it increases much 
slower. Raising it above about 400% is more and more difficult.

Chance of hitting:
     Your chance of hitting a monster depends on your innate melee skill,
your Dexterity, plusses to hit from all equipped items other than your 
missile weapon, temporary effects (like blessing or heroism), and on monster 
armour class.  Unseen monsters are harder to hit.  The terrain you are 
standing in, and whether you are native to that terrain can also make it 
easier or harder to get a hit.
     If your weapon is too heavy for your Strength, you will get a to-hit penalty.

Damage Dice:
     All weapons have damage dice displayed after their name (1d4, 2d5, etc.).
The higher the damage dice, the more damage the weapon does, especially if it
has brands or slays, or gets lots of critical hits.
     Using a weapon with large base damage is more important in Ironband
than in Angband or NPP, because the damage bonus is a multiplier rather than
an adder. 

Brands and Slays:
     Some remarkable weapons do extra damage to various kinds of monsters; a
Dagger branded with Fire, for instance, would do extra damage to creatures not 
immune to fire.  Slays, in contrast, do extra damage to particular monster 
races, so wield that Mace of Slays (orc) if you come upon any orcs.  
     The damage bonus adds on to the damage modifier - i.e. if you have +200%
damage, and attack an evil enemy with a Slay Evil sword for an additional +100%,
then you have a total of +300% or quadruple base damage.
     Unlike in other *bands, in Ironband you get the bonus for your best slay
that applies PLUS the bonus for your best brand that applies. So combining a 
slay and a brand, if possible, gives a lot of damage!
     You can always tell if your brands or slays are working by checking out
your hit message (e.g. 'You zap the orc!' means your Lightning brand is 
helping).

Critical Hits:
     The number of critical hits you get depends on your total bonuses to melee
skill, your level, and your weapon weight.  Their power depends on weapon
weight. A heavy weapon does truly gnarly criticals.
     Two-handed weapons are more likely to do a critical hit than one-handed weapons.

Number of Blows:
     Your character screen also displays the number of blows you can get per
turn. Getting many blows is important. The number depends on your dexterity.
If your weapon is too heavy for your Strength, then your number of blows
will be greatly reduced. You will get a warning message if this happens.
In this case you will also get a to-hit penalty, especially if the weapon is
much too heavy.
     You can (I)nspect a weapon to find out how many blows you would get if 
you wielded that weapon.


--- Shooting ---

     Ranged fire with missile launchers is a non-magical method of doing damage
at a safe distance.

Basic Calculation:
     1) roll the missile's damage dice
     2) add the damage bonuses from both the missile weapon and the ammunition,
        but not from anything else
     3) apply the missile launcher multiplier
     4) apply any slay or brand multiplier
     5) apply any critical hit bonuses

Setting up to Shoot:
     Slings shoot pebbles, iron shots, and mithril shots, bows shoot arrows,
seeker arrows, and mithril arrows, and crossbows shoot bolts, seeker bolts, and
mithril bolts.  Simply equip the weapon and keep plenty of the ammo on hand and
you're ready.
     You shoot at a monster by typing 'f' (or 't' in the rogue-like command
set), then selecting a missile you would like to fire.  This activates the
targeting interface described in the section on commands.

Misfires:
     If your Dexterity is low, your shots may sometimes go in the wrong direction.

Chance of hitting:
     Your chance of hitting a monster depends on your innate missile skill,
your Perception, plusses to hit from all equipped items other than your melee weapon, 
plusses to hit on your ammunition, temporary effects (like blessing or heroism), and on
monster armour class.  Unseen monsters are harder to hit.  The terrain you are 
standing in, and whether you are native to that terrain can also make it easier 
or harder to get a hit.

Base damage:
     Launcher, slay/brand, and critical hit multiplers are all applied after the 
bonus to damage, which is applied directly to the result of the base damage dice.

Launcher Multiplier:
     All missile launchers have a multiplier to damage:  for example, a Longbow
(x3) would multiply the normal damage of the ammo it fires by three.  Some
special weapons have a higher than normal multiplier.

Brands and Slays:
     Ammunition occasionally possesses the same kinds of slays and brands found
on melee weapons. They work rather differently, acting as a multiplier on the total 
damage, but they are still very good! 

Critical hits:
     The number of critical hits you get depends on your total bonuses to
missile skill, your level, and your missile weight, but they are always rare.

Number of Shots:
     On your character screen is displayed the number of shots you can get per
turn. If you have higher dexterity you will get more shots.
     Extra shots are not fired all at once; instead, each shot takes
less time, making monsters appear to move in slow motion.


--- Throwing ---

     Melee weapons also do (some) damage when thrown, and there are potions and
mushrooms that can be deadly.  There are special throwing weapons that do extra
damage when thrown.  "Well Balanced" weapons do even more damage and are 
never destroyed when thrown.  Throwing certain potions will produce special effects
on a monster if the potion hits them.

Basic Calculation:
     1) Roll the object's base damage dice.
     2) Add any bonus to damage (only wargear will have such a bonus).
     3) Apply any slay or brand multiplier.
     4) Apply any critical hit.

Chance of hitting:
     Your chance of hitting a monster depends on your innate missile skill,
plusses to hit from all equipped items other than your melee and missile
weapons, temporary effects (like blessing or heroism), and on monster armour
class.  Unseen monsters are harder to hit.  The terrain you are standing in, 
and whether you are native to that terrain can also make it easier or harder 
to get a hit.

Comments:
     You may only throw one object per turn.  Your throwing range depends on
object weight and your strength.


--- Winning "unwinnable" fights ---

     Some monsters are simply too tough to just clobber; fortunately, there are
scrolls, potions, spells, and magical devices that can turn a losing battle into
a major victory.  If your enemies seem too tough to kill now, maybe they won't
be after you've enhanced yourself and hindered them.

Special Notes:
     In order to attack a creature that you can't see in a wall or door, you
must issue the Tunnel or alter adjacent grid command.

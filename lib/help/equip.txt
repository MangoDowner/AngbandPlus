
====== Object Attributes ======


     All effective combat methods require equipment, and all benefit greatly
from various qualities that your equipped items may possess.  Defence is
similarly equipment-dependent.
     Attacks can also benefit or be hindered depending on the terrain in which 
the player or creature is standing.



--- Ordinary Attributes ---

Example 1:  A Battle Axe (2d8) (+6,+4)

Damage dice:
     The weapon above rolls two eight-sided dice in battle, for an average base
damage of: 2 * (8 + 1) / 2  =>  2 * 9 / 2  =>  9.

Bonus to hit:
     The weapon above has a bonus to hit of 6.  This bonus improves your chance
to hit monsters.  Apart from rare gloves, armours seldom have bonuses to combat.
Some have small penalties (see below).

Bonus to damage:
     The weapon above gets a bonus to your damage rating. If your damage rating
would otherwise be +0, increasing it to +4 gives you +80% melee damage. (This is 
different from other *bands). Press 'C' to see the character info screen, which 
tells you your damage bonus as a percentage.


Example 2:  A Hard Leather Armour (-1) [6,+5]

Base Armour Class (AC):
     This armour has a base AC of 6.  All armours have a base armour class; very
few weapons do.

Bonus to Armour Class:
     This armour has a bonus to AC of 5, which gives it a total protective value
of 11.  Armour of unusually good quality or that is magical also increases your
bonus to armour class.  

Penalty to hit and to Stealth:
     This armor reduces your hit bonus and Stealth by 1.


Example 3:  A Mace (Holy Avenger) (2d4) (+7,+5) [+3] (+1)

     This weapon is a Holy Avenger (one of the more powerful ego-items).  It
rolls 2 four-sided dice when attacking and has +7 to hit and +5 to damage (which 
is converted to a percentile).  It increases your AC by 3, and increases a 
numerical attribute (Wisdom, in this case) by 1.


--- Adjustments to Vital statistics and Abilities ---

Stat Bonuses:
     Any kind of wearable item may affect one or more stats.  See the section on
your character to find out more about what altering a stat does.

Sustain Stats:
     Any kind of wearable item may sustain one or more stats.  This ensures that
the attacks of your foes never lower that stat.

Searching:
     Some rings, headgear, and various other items improve your chances to
reveal secret doors and find traps before they find you.  Bonuses to searching
improve both automatic and manual searching.

Infravision:
     Some headgear and (more rarely) other items increase the range at which you
can see warm-blooded creatures, even those that would otherwise be invisible.

Tunneling:
     Some gloves and weapons allow you to dig through rock more effectively.
All special digging tools have a bonus to tunneling.

Speed:
     Boots, rings, and weapons that hasten you are rare and powerful, for a fast
player can perform several actions in the time it used to take to do just one.
Players moving at speed -10 are half as fast as normal, at +10 are twice as fast
as normal, and at +20 are three times as fast as normal.  The maximum useful
speed is (roughly) +30.


--- Weapon Attributes ---

In most *bands, only the best slay or brand you have applies.
In Ironband, if your weapon has a slay and a brand, you get a double damage bonus!
Slay and brand bonuses increase the '+-to-damage' percentage.

If you hit a monster with a slay/brand melee weapon, your hit message will change 
(i.e. You freeze the orc, or You smite [slay] the baby green dragon).

Damage multipliers from slays on melee weapons (only the best applies):
     Slay Evil      :  +100 to the damage percentile against evil enemies 
                         (i.e. adds 100% of your weapon damage roll)
     Slay Animal    :  +200 
     Slay Orc       :  +200
     Slay Troll     :  +200
     Slay Giant     :  +170
     Slay Undead    :  +170
     Slay Demon     :  +170
     Slay Dragon    :  +170

     Execute Undead :  +300
     Execute Demon  :  +300
     Execute Dragon :  +300

Damage multipliers from brands on melee weapons (only the best applies):
     Brand Acid     :  +130 against everything not resistant to acid
     Brand Elec     :  +130 against everything not resistant to electricity
     Brand Fire     :  +130 against everything not resistant to fire
     Brand Cold     :  +130 against everything not resistant to cold
     Brand Pois     :  +130 against everything not resistant to poison

Ammo slays and brands work just the same as in regular NPPAngband.

Damage multipliers from slays and brands on ammo (only the best applies)

     Slay Evil      :  x2 against evil enemies
     Slay Animal    :  x2 against animals
     Slay Orc       :  x2 against orcs and orc-like creatures
     Slay Troll     :  x2 against trolls
     Slay Giant     :  x2 against giants
     Slay Undead    :  x2 against undead
     Slay Demon     :  x2 against demons
     Slay Dragon    :  x2 against dragons

     Execute Undead :  x3 against undead
     Execute Demon  :  x3 against demons
     Execute Dragon :  x3 against dragons

     Brand Acid     :  x2 against everything not resistant to acid
     Brand Elec     :  x2 against everything not resistant to electricity
     Brand Fire     :  x2 against everything not resistant to fire
     Brand Cold     :  x2 against everything not resistant to cold
     Brand Pois     :  x2 against everything not resistant to poison

Throwing Weapons: 	Damage is doubled when throwing this weapon.
Well balanced Weapons:  Damage is doubled (again).

Blows:
     Gives you extra melee blows.

Extra Shots:
     Rare missile launchers may allow the player to shoot more quickly than
normal.  Each shot takes a fraction of a turn, making your target appear to move
in slow motion.

Extra Might:
     Rare missile launchers have a greater than normal missile damage
multiplier.  For example, a "Sling of Extra Might (x2) (+1)" multiplies damage,
not by two like lesser slings, but by three.  The true missile weapon multiplier
is never known for sure until the object is identified.

Blessed:
     Blessed weapons improve your saving throws.

Earthquake:
     Some weapons cause earthquakes when they hit.


--- Immunities ---

     If you should ever be fortunate enough to find a piece of equipment that
grants immunity to an element, you will take no damage from that element.
Immunity also means that everything you are wearing or carrying is perfectly
protected.

Immunity to Acid:
     You take no damage from acid, and acid cannot attack your backpack.

Immunity to Electricity:
     You take no damage from electricity, and electricity cannot attack your
backpack.

Immunity to Cold:
     You take no damage from cold, and cold cannot attack your backpack.

Immunity to Fire:
     You take no damage from fire, and fire cannot attack your backpack.

Immunity to Poison:
     You take no damage from poison.


--- Resistances ---

     Resistances from equipment cannot be combined; you either have it or you
don't.  You can, however, temporarily oppose the elements and poison for an
additional 2/3rds reduction in damage.
     Resistances and oppositions also help reduce the amount of damage
elemental attacks do to items in your backpack.

Resist Acid:
     You take one-thirds damage from acid.

Resist Electricity:
     You take one-thirds damage from electricity.

Resist Cold:
     You take one thirds damage from cold.

Resist Fire:
     You take one-thirds damage from fire.

Resist Poison:
     You take one thirds damage from poison.

Resist Light:
     The damage you take from light is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by bright
light.

Resist Darkness:
     The damage you take from darkness is reduced.  You cannot be blinded by
darkness.

Resist Sound:
     The damage you take from sound is reduced.  You cannot be stunned by sound
or by a few other kinds of distance attacks.

Resist Shards:
     The damage you take from blasts of shards is reduced.  You cannot be cut by
shards.

Resist Nexus:
     The damage you take from nexus attacks is reduced.  You cannot be randomly
teleported or altered by nexus.

Resist Nether:
     The damage you take from nether is reduced.  You cannot lose experience to
nether.

Resist Chaos:
     The damage you take from chaos is reduced, and you are immune to all the
nasty things chaos can do to you.  This resistance does not make you resistant
to confusion.

Resist Disenchantment:
     Rarest of all the resistances, this reduces damage from disenchantment
attacks and renders your equipment immune to disenchantment.

Ignore acid, electricity, fire, and cold:
     Some objects cannot be damaged or destroyed by elemental attacks.


--- Survival Attributes ---

Resist Fear:
     Renders you fearless.

Resist Blindness:
     Protects you from being blinded.

Resist Confusion:
     Makes you incapable of being confused.  Also reduces damage from blasts of
confusion.


--- Character Qualities ---

Slow Digestion:
     Reduces your need to consume food.

Feather Fall:
     Renders pit traps and trap doors harmless.

Light:
     Some weapons and helms shine with inner light.  Each such object increases
your illumination radius by one.

Regeneration:
     Players who regenerate recover hitpoints and mana twice as quickly as
normal.  They also need to eat more.

Telepathy (ESP):
     It is not easy to acquire this, but players who do can see intelligent
monsters nearby.  Mindless monsters never appear, and semi-intelligent monsters
only appear occasionally.

See Invisible:
     Allows you to see and target monsters invisible to ordinary sight.

Free Action:
     Protects you from paralyzation and most slowing attacks.  Because
paralyzation can instantly kill you, keep an eye out for this important survival
aid.

Hold Life:
     Offers a high degree of protection from attacks (but not items) that reduce
experience.


--- Curses and other Nastiness ---

Random Teleportation:
     Some foul rings, amulets, and boots randomly take control of your movement
and whisk you around the dungeon.

Aggravate:
     Aggravation effectively reduces your stealth to nil, immediately waking up
all monsters nearby.  Some rings and amulets possess curses that aggravate, and
some weapons and armours are so powerful that no creature can ignore them.

Drain Exp:
     Objects that drain experience are perilous, because they slowly but surely
erase your accumulated memories.  Of course, you can keep killing monsters to
replace the experience which you lose.

Light (Normal) Curse:
     Many objects have light curses.  If you should wear or wield one, read a
scroll of Remove Curse.

Heavy Curse:
     The curses on some objects are less easy to remove. An ordinary Remove Curse
spell or scroll may reduce the penalties on such an object but will not let you 
take it off. In this case, find and read a scroll of *Remove Curse* (or cast the spell,
if you know it).

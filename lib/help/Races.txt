=== The Races ===

***** <Human>
--- Human ---

  The human is the base character. All other races are compared to them. Humans
  are average at everything and also tend to go up levels faster than most
  other races because of their shorter life spans. No racial adjustments or
  intrinsics occur to characters choosing human. However, humans may choose a
  special talent at L30 that more than makes up for their overall mediocrity.


***** <Tonberry>
--- Tonberry ---

  Tonberries are lizard-like creatures who possess enormous strength and have a
  preference for cleavers and large knives. They are, however, sluggish in
  their movements and reactions; young and inexperienced tonberries are often
  preyed on by the other races. They possess human-like intelligence, but
  rarely become mages due to their culture and physiology.


***** <Demigod>
--- Demigod ---

  The term demigod is commonly used to describe mythological figures whose one
  parent was a god and whose other parent was human; as such, demigods are
  human-god hybrids and are quite powerful. Demigods receive special abilities
  depending on their parentage.


  See [a] for more details on demigod parentage.


***** <Hobbit>
--- Hobbit ---

  Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have good saving
  throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming, perception, and
  stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to be called burglars.
  They are much weaker than humans, and no good at melee fighting. Halflings
  have fair infravision, so they can detect warm creatures at a distance. They
  have a strong hold on their life force, and are thus intrinsically resistant
  to life draining.


***** <Gnome>
--- Gnome ---

  Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than Halflings. They, like the
  hobbits, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent mages,
  and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching, disarming,
  perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans so they are not
  very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so
  they can detect warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Gnomes are
  intrinsically protected against paralysis.


***** <Dwarf>
--- Dwarf ---

  Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Dwarves tend to be
  stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than humans. Because
  they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they resist spells which are
  cast on them. They are very good at searching, perception, fighting, and
  bows. Dwarves  have miserable stealth. They can never be blinded.


***** <Snotling>
--- Snotling ---

  Snotlings are greenskins, and are cousins of Goblins and Orcs, smaller than
  the former and dumber than the latter, often used by them as cannon fodder,
  food or even cannon missiles. They are on the lowest rung of greenskin
  society and are bullied by all. Snotlings often wield mushrooms or sticks
  into battle.


***** <Half-Troll>
--- Half-Troll ---

  Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most other
  races. They are also very stupid and slow. They are bad at searching,
  disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces
  in their presence. They also happen to be fun to run... Half-trolls always
  have their strength sustained. At higher levels, Half-Trolls regenerate
  wounds automatically.


***** <Amberite>
--- Amberite ---

  The Amberites are a reputedly immortal race, who are endowed with numerous
  advantages in addition to their longevity. They are very tough and their
  constitution cannot be reduced, and their ability to heal wounds far
  surpasses that of any other race. Having seen virtually everything, very
  little is new to them, and they gain levels much slower than the other races.


***** <High-Elf>
--- High-Elf ---

  High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of time.
  They are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, although
  their wisdom is sometimes suspect. High-elves begin their lives able to see
  the unseen, and resist light effects just like regular elves. However, there
  are few things that they have not seen already, and experience is very hard
  for them to gain.


***** <Barbarian>
--- Barbarian ---

  Barbarians are hardy men of the north. They are fierce in combat, and their
  wrath is feared throughout the world. Combat is their life: they feel no
  fear, and they learn to enter battle frenzy at will even sooner than
  half-trolls. Barbarians are, however, suspicious of magic, which makes magic
  devices fairly hard for them to use.


***** <Half-Ogre>
--- Half-Ogre ---

  Half-Ogres are like Half-Orcs, only more so. They are big, bad, and stupid.
  For warriors, they have all the necessary attributes, and they can even
  become wizards: after all, they are related to Ogre Magi, from whom they have
  learned the skill of setting trapped runes once their level is high enough. 
  Like Half-Orcs, they resist darkness, and like Half-Trolls, they have their
  strength sustained.


***** <Half-Giant>
--- Half-Giant ---

  Half-Giants limited intelligence makes it difficult for them to become full
  spellcasters, but with their huge strength they make excellent warriors.
  Their thick skin makes them resistant to shards, and like Half-Ogres and
  Half-Trolls, they have their strength sustained.


***** <Half-Titan>
--- Half-Titan ---

  Half-mortal descendants of the mighty titans, these immensely powerful
  creatures put almost any other race to shame. They may lack the fascinating
  special powers of certain other races, but their enhanced attributes more
  than make up for that. They learn to estimate the strengths of their foes,
  and their love for law and order makes them resistant to the effects of
  Chaos.


***** <Cyclops>
--- Cyclops ---

  With but one eye, a Cyclops can see more than many with two eyes. They are
  headstrong, and loud noises bother them very little. They are not quite
  qualified for the magic using professions, but as a certain Mr. Ulysses can
  testify, their accuracy with thrown rocks can be deadly!


***** <Yeek>
--- Yeek ---

  Yeeks are among the most pathetic creatures. Fortunately, their horrible
  screams can scare away less confident foes, and their skin becomes more and
  more resistant to acid, as they gain experience. But having said that, even a
  mediocre monster can wipe the proverbial floor with an unwary Yeek.


***** <Klackon>
--- Klackon ---

  Klackons are bizarre semi-intelligent ant-like insectoid creatures. They make
  great fighters, but their mental abilities are severely limited. Obedient and
  well-ordered, they can never be confused. They are also very nimble, and
  become faster as they advance levels. They are also very acidic, inherently
  resisting acid, and capable of spitting acid at higher levels.


***** <Kobold>
--- Kobold ---

  Kobolds are a weak goblin race. They love poisoned weapons, and can learn to
  throw poisoned darts (of which they carry an unlimited supply). They are also
  inherently resistant to poison, although they are not one of the more
  powerful races.


***** <Nibelung>
--- Nibelung ---

  The hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these cave-dwellers are
  not much bothered by darkness. Their natural inclination to magical items has
  made them immune to effects which could drain away magical energy.


***** <Dark-Elf>
--- Dark-Elf ---

  Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by darkness attacks,
  the Dark Elves have a long tradition and knowledge of magic. They have an
  inherent magic missile attack available to them at a low level. With their
  keen sight, they also learn to see invisible things as their relatives
  High-Elves do, but at a higher level.


***** <Draconian>
--- Draconian ---

  Draconians are a humanoid race with dragon-like attributes. As they advance
  levels, they gain new elemental resistances (up to Poison Resistance), and
  they also have a breath weapon, which becomes more powerful with experience.
  The exact type of the breath weapon depends on the Draconian's class and
  level.  With their wings, they can easily escape any pit trap unharmed.


***** <Mindflayer>
--- Mindflayer ---

  Mindflayers are a secretive and mysterious ancient race. Their civilization
  may well be older than any other on our planet, and their intelligence and
  wisdom are naturally sustained, and are so great that they enable Mindflayers
  to become more powerful spellcasters than any other race, even if their
  physical attributes are a good deal less admirable.  As they advance levels,
  they gain the powers of See Invisible and Telepathy.


***** <Imp>
--- Imp ---

  A demon-creature from the nether-world, naturally resistant to fire attacks,
  and capable of learning fire bolt and fire ball attacks. They are little
  loved by other races, but can perform fairly well in most professions. As
  they advance levels, they gain the powers of See Invisible.


***** <Golem>
--- Golem ---

  A Golem is an artificial creature, built from a lifeless raw material like
  clay, and awakened to life. They are nearly mindless, making them useless for
  professions which rely on magic, but as warriors they are very tough. They
  are resistant to poison, they can see invisible things, and move freely. At
  higher levels, they also become resistant to attacks which threaten to drain
  away their life force. Golems gain very little nutrition from ordinary food,
  but can absorb mana from staves and wands as their power source. Golems also
  gain a natural armor class bonus from their tough body. Golems become slower
  with age.


***** <Skeleton>
--- Skeleton ---

  There are two types of skeletons: the ordinary, warrior-like skeletons, and
  the spell-using skeletons, which are also called liches. As undead beings,
  skeletons need to worry very little about poison or attacks that can drain
  life. They do not really use eyes for perceiving things, and are thus not
  fooled by invisibility. Their bones are resistant to sharp shrapnel, and they
  will quickly become resistant to cold. Although the magical effects of these
  will affect the skeleton even without entering the skeleton's (non-existent)
  belly, the potion or food itself will fall through the skeleton's jaws,
  giving no nutritional benefit. They can absorb mana from staves and wands as
  their energy source.


***** <Zombie>
--- Zombie ---

  Much like Skeletons, Zombies too are undead horrors: they are resistant to
  life-draining attacks, and can learn to restore their life-force. Like
  skeletons, they become resistant to cold-based attacks (actually earlier than
  skeletons), resist poison and can see invisible. While still vulnerable to
  cuts (unlike skeletons), Zombies are resistant to Nether. Like Golems, they
  gain very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but can absorb mana from
  staves and wands as their energy source.


***** <Vampire>
--- Vampire ---

  One of the mightier undead creatures, the Vampire is an awe-inspiring sight.
  Yet this dread creature has a serious weakness: the bright rays of sun are
  its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the deep recesses of earth
  until the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the other hand, only makes the
  Vampire stronger. As undead, the Vampire has a firm hold on its life force,
  and resists nether attacks. The Vampire also resists cold and poison based
  attacks. It is, however, susceptible to its perpetual hunger for fresh blood,
  which can only be satiated by sucking the blood from a nearby monster.


***** <Spectre>
--- Spectre ---

  Another powerful undead creature: the Spectre is a ghastly apparition,
  surrounded by an unearthly green glow. They exist only partially on our plane
  of existence: half-corporeal, they can pass through walls, although the
  density of the wall will hurt them in the process of doing this. As undead,
  they have a firm hold on their life force, see invisible, and resist poison
  and cold. They also resist nether. Spectres make superb spellcasters, but
  their physical form is very weak. They gain very little nutrition from the
  food of mortals, but can absorb mana from staves and wands as their energy
  source.


***** <Sprite>
--- Sprite ---

  One of the several fairy races, Sprites are very small. They have tiny wings
  and can fly over traps that may open up beneath them. They enjoy sunlight
  intensely, and need worry little about light based attacks. Although
  physically among the weakest races, Sprites are very talented in magic, and
  can become highly skilled wizards. Sprites have the special power of spraying
  Sleeping Dust, and at higher levels they learn to fly faster.


***** <Beastman>
--- Beastman ---

  This race is a blasphemous abomination produced by Chaos. It is not an
  independent race but rather a humanoid creature, most often a human, twisted
  by the Chaos, or a nightmarish crossbreed of a human and a beast. All
  Beastmen are accustomed to Chaos so much that they are untroubled by
  confusion and sound, although raw logrus can still have effects on them.
  Beastmen revel in chaos, as it twists them more and more. Beastmen are
  subject to mutations: when they have been created, they receive a random
  mutation. After that, every time they advance a level they have a small
  chance of gaining yet another mutation.


***** <Ent>
--- Ent ---

  The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world, oldest
  of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the land, they were
  summoned to guard the forests of Middle-earth. Being much like trees they are
  very clumsy but strong, and very susceptible to fire. They gain very little
  nutrition from the food of mortals, but they can absorb water from potions as
  their nutrition.


***** <Archon>
--- Archon ---

  Archons are a higher class of angels. They are good at all skills, and are
  strong, wise, and are a favorite with any people. They are able to see the
  unseen, and their wings allow them to safely fly over traps and other
  dangerous places. However, belonging to a higher plane as they do, the
  experiences of this world do not leave a strong impression on them and they
  gain levels slowly.


***** <Balrog>
--- Balrog ---

  Balrogs are a higher class of demons. They are strong, intelligent and tough.
  They do not believe in gods, and are not suitable for priest at all. Balrog
  are resistant to fire and nether, and have a firm hold on their life force.
  They also eventually learn to see invisible things. They are good at almost
  all skills except stealth. They gain very little nutrition from the food of
  mortals, and need human corpses as sacrifices to regain their vitality.


***** <Dunadan>
--- Dunadan ---

  Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West. This elder race surpasses
  human abilities in every field, especially constitution. However, being men
  of the world, very little is new to them, and levels are very hard for them
  to gain. Their constitution cannot be reduced. 


***** <Shadow-Fairy>
--- Shadow-Fairy ---

  Shadow Fairies are one of the several fairy races. They have wings, and can
  fly over traps that may open up beneath them. Shadow Fairies must beware of
  sunlight, as they are vulnerable to bright light. They are physically weak,
  but have advantages in using magic and are amazingly stealthy. Shadow Fairies
  have a wonderful advantage in that they never aggravate monsters (If their
  equipment normally aggravates monsters, they only suffer a penalty to
  stealth, but if they aggravate by their personality itself, the advantage
  will be lost).


***** <Kutar>
--- Kutar ---

  A Kutar is an expressionless animal-like living creature. The word 'kuta'
  means 'absentmindedly' or 'vacantly'. Their absentmindedness hurts their
  searching and perception skills, but renders them incapable of being
  confused. Their unearthly calmness and serenity make them among the most
  stealthy of any race. Kutars, although expressionless, are beautiful and so
  have a high charisma. Members of this race can learn to expand their body
  horizontally. This increases armour class, but renders them vulnerable to
  magical attacks.


***** <Android>
--- Android ---

  An android is a artificial creation with a body of machinery. Over the
  millenia, artificial intelligence has improved to the point where androids
  are nearly as smart as humans, though perhaps not so wise. Of course, their
  mechanical body offers great physical advantages, far surpassing the powers
  of man.  Androids don't acquire experience like other races, but rather gain
  in power as they attach new equipment to their frame. Rings, amulets, and
  lights do not influence growth.  Androids are resistant to poison, can move
  freely, and are immune to life-draining attacks.  Moreover, because of their
  hard metallic bodies, they get a bonus to AC. Androids have electronic
  circuits throughout their body and must beware of electric shocks. They gain
  very little nutrition from the food of mortals, but they can use flasks of
  oil as their energy source.


***** <Doppelganger>
--- Doppelganger ---

  Doppelgangers a truly pathetic creatures. While nobody has actually ever seen
  their true form, they are rumored to be small, plain, pathetic creatures.
  Their one saving grace is the ability to mimic other races.

ELF
-----

Elves are native to the southern forests of Portralis. They are 
slightly shorter than humans, are generally frailer but more 
dextrous, and are distinguishable from humans by their fair, 
pale skin and pointed ears. Legends tells that originally, there 
was no elves living on Portralis. Legend tells that their origins 
lies in another world, in another place,  but that some of 
them somehow ended up here. They adapted themselves to the new 
land, and have found home in the southern forests. Though not as 
widespread as humans, elves have significant power and influence 
in Portralis,  especially in the magical lore. Elves are also known 
to be the finest archers in the world.

Elves are physically weaker than humans. However, they are dextrous
and agile. Also, elves are wise peoples, and have a great bond with
nature and magic. Elvish spellcasters are greatly respected by
their allies, and feared by their enemies. Nimbraya being a highly
religious kingdom, Mysticism magic tend to be one of the most practiced
and widely used school of magic amongst it's population. Due to their
natural dexterity, elves also makes the finest archers in Portralis.
Being more agile and nimble also makes them better at becoming
ambidextrous, and fighting with two weapons.

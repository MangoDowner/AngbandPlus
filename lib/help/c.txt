ELF
-----

Elves are slimmer and a little shorter than humans. They have
pointed ears, and generally live in forests, and live in perfect
harmony with nature and animals. Elves have a superior dexterity
and agility compared to humans, and due to that great dexterity,
they make good archers. However, their weaker stature also makes
them weaker and frailer than humans, making them less suited
for melee combat, although their natural dexterity and agility
does give them some advantages.

1) MONSTER FAQ

Are monsters susceptible to certain attacks, like they were in Moria?

      Monster spell resistances have been changed from Moria. In Moria, a
      white dragon took extra damage from a fire bolt/ball, and partial (1/4th)
      damage from a frost bolt/ball. In Angband, a white dragon takes normal
      damage from a fire bolt/ball, and almost no (1/9th) damage from a frost
      bolt/ball. Basically, there are no more "susceptibilities." There are a couple
      of exceptions to this. Monsters can be susceptible to bright light (ie, wand
      of light, not lightning), and holy orb does extra damage vs. evil creatures.
      Earthy creatures are also susceptible to stone-to-mud attacks. 

Why are there two different entries in my monster memory for the
same monster? 

      The monster memory does show more than one description for some
      monsters. Some examples are novice mages/priests/warriors/rangers,
      mimics, gnome mages, etc. There are two or more entries because there are
      actually two or more different types of these monsters. Often the
      difference between them is that one is found solo and the other is found in
      groups, at a slightly deeper level. 

I killed a monster that I couldn't see. Do I get credit in the monster
memory for the kill? What about experience? 

      Monster memory doesn't give you credit for killing a monster if you cannot
      see the monster (if you are blind, or the monster is in a dark area beyond
      your infravision range, etc). The recall code for unique monsters is slightly
      different, and the monster memory will note their deaths, unless you never
      saw them, even by an "ancestor." You will still gain experience regardless. 

How do I kill large numbers of orcs/trolls fairly easily? 

      Orcs and trolls can be fun to line up in a long corridor and then blast with a
      wand of light! (Not all types are susceptible.) A rod of light can be a
      mid-level character's best friend, doing good damage against a whole line of
      susceptible monsters, with a really fast (9 rounds) recharge. For
      higher-level characters, dispel evil, orb of draining or a staff of power can
      also work wonders. 

Why can't I target a monster in a wall? 

      Monsters in walls can't be hit with spells or missiles, only by physical
      attacks. 

Should I kill Farmer Maggot? 

      Unfortunately, yes. He can't harm you, just hit him until he dies. He may
      drop a nice item for your troubles. 

I'm having lots of trouble with a unique monster. Help! 

      Run or teleport the monster away. You can kill the unique later, when
      you're tougher. Speed helps a great deal, as does a nice missile weapon,
      especially with uniques that resist all the major attack forms (Mim and
      Lorgan come to mind). 

============================================================================

2) Troublesome monsters

While most of the monsters in angband present some sort of a
challenge to the character, there are some that my priest found
particuarly troublesome. 

  'l' The lice. Irritating breeding lice. One can be dealt with, two
      are not much of a problem. over 10 of the things and without a
      good area effect spell the only real option is to run. They aren't
      dangerous alone but a whole roomful *shudder* 

  ',' The magic mushroom patch. It slows, confuses, darkens the
      room, then blinks away. Easy to kill, but difficult to catch. 

  'I' Hammerhorns. Worse than lice. They bite to confuse. Get in
      a room with these without resist confusion and the average
      character is as good as dead. 

  'Q' Nexus Quelthalaq. Do no damage, do not move, easy to kill.
      But every time you get within range you are teleported away or
      it teleports away. Very irritating. 

  'D' Dracolich. Breaths poison and nether. Bane of just about
      any character. Has high enough hit points to be difficult to kill.

3) The Poet's Guide to Dangerous Monsters

 Obviously, as you get more powerful, some monsters lose their
 challenge. For a level one character, almost every monster in the
 game is a monster to avoid! On the other hand, if you're poking
 around at 700 feet when you're only level one, whatever happens is
 your own fault. Therefore, a list of monsters to avoid, by character
 level:

 Level 1
 * Battle-Scarred Veteran ('t')- don't even think about it if you're not
 an experienced player using a class with a lot of hitpoints.
 * Cave Spiders ('S')- these things are nasty! They travel in packs and
 they're fast. If you see them and you don't have a good stealth,
 you're pretty much dead.
 * Black Naga ('n')- tough as hell, but certainly within the realm of
 possibility. Ask yourself if you've got a good escape route handy
 before you wade in, though.

 Level 5
 * Bullroarer the Hobbit ('h')- What are you doing fighting him at your
 level? Chances are, he won't kill you, but he'll strip you of all of your
 wordly possessions, and you'll never be able to nail him to get them
 back.
 * Large kobold ('k')- Avoid, avoid, avoid. They've got scads of hit
 points and they hit HARD. Don't think that the difference in power
 level between a small kobold and a kobold is the same as the
 difference between a kobold and a large kobold.
 * Novice archer ('p')- Wait a few levels and he won't be so tough.
 * Giant White Lice ('l')- Kill as many as possible as quickly as you
 can. Keep movement to a minimum and use area-effect weapons, if
 possible.

 Level 10
 * Cave orcs ('o')- You'll want to build up a few levels first. If you
 must fight them, do it in a corridor so you don't get swarmed under
 by the little beggars.
 * Mughash the Kobold Lord ('k')- He's surrounded by a bunch of his
 followers- probably large kobolds, who are tough enough without
 having to deal with the big guy.

 Level 15
 * Orfax, son of Boldor ('y')- Even more annoying than Bullroarer,
 and he actually has a chance to kill you. If you must face him, keep
 him at a distance along a corridor if possible and pepper him with
 distance attacks.

 Level 20
 * Grape Jelly ('j')- Too many hitpoints to risk a toe-to-toe assault.
 Use arrows and spells instead.
 * Boldor, King of the Yeeks ('y')- Just as irritating as Orfax. Use the
 same technique to crater him.
 * Ochre Jelly ('j')- Yiiii! As soon as you see one, throw everything
 you have at it before it gets close enough to actually touch you.
 * Giant Black Lice ('l')- Kill as many as possible as quickly as
 possible without waking any up (i.e., as soon as you see one, make
 sure it dies before you take another step)

 Level 25
 * Magic Mushroom patch (',')- KILL! The most irritating monster in
 the game, bar none. Try to kill as many with each shot as you can.
 Use distance attacks.
 * Hummerhorn ('I')- Try like hell not to wake them up, and kill as
 many as you can (area-effect, if necessary) with each shot. Keep
 your distance and don't be afraid to slam doors.
 * Hounds of all sorts ('Z')- Any hound except Clear Hounds, Light
 Hounds, and Dark Hounds, are a serious threat to your life and/or
 inventory. This is true whenever you meet them. Fight only in
 corridors, and make sure only one or two of them can see you at a
 time.
 * Bolg, Son of Azog ('o')- Careful. He is a serious upgrade from the
 other orc uniques.

 Level 30
 * Azog, King of the Uruk-Hai ('o')- By far the most dangerous of the
 orc uniques. Make sure you match him in speed, and keep your
 distance.
 * Master Rogue ('p')- Pepper him with arrows before he gets too $#?
 close!
 * Ibun and Khim, the sons of Mim ('h')- You don't want these little
 beggars touching you in combat, trust me. Use arrows, spells,
 whatever. Just keep them at a distance.
 * 4-Headed Hydra ('M')- Don't toy with them. They're serious
 business. Fast, strong, and they inspire fear.

 Level 35 and up
 * Mim, Betrayer of Turin ('h')- same deal as his treacherous sons.
 * Acidic Cytoplasm ('j')- Think of an Ochre Jelly on steroids and
 caffeine with a serious hate-on for you and yours. Easily the worst
 jelly in the whole game, and rarely a good idea to go hand-to-hand.
 * Dread ('G')- the most annoying ghost. Tough, and it often travels
 in packs. Be very careful.
 * Lorgan, Chief of the Easterlings ('p')- a prodigious summoner. He
 has a nasty habit of summoning Kavlax the Many-Headed. Kill kill kill
 as quickly as you can.
 * Black jelly ('j')- A slightly less irritating version of the Acidic
 Cytoplasm.
 * Time vortex ('v')- Kill it ASAP.
 * Kavlax the Many-Headed ('d')- I don't care HOW tough you are,
 wear down his hitpoints as fast as you $#*@ can. He's got one
 weapon in his arsenal that can level you.
 * Lesser Titam ('P')- Bad news on a stick. One of the worst
 monsters in the game. Each time you see one is an occasion to curse.
 * Enchantress ('p')- Kill her now, before she summons her pets.
 * Solar ('A')- He makes all the angels that came before look REALLY
 wimpy. Don't let one solar summon another one.
 * Undead Beholder ('e')- Not an easy task.
 * Dreadmaster ('G')- Like a Dread, only worse.
 * Drolem ('g')- Take the most irritating aspects of a dragon, stuff it
 into an artificial life form with enough hitpoints to embarrass most
 uniques, and you've got a drolem. Whittle it away before it can
 breathe on you.
 * Dracolich ('D')- Not fun. Hope you have Nether resistance...
 * Greater Titan ('P')- You're probably going to have to change your
 undies after this particular battle... assuming you survive...
 * Dracolisk ('D')- Less fun than a Dracolich.
 * Death mold ('m')- NEVER worth it. Ever. Not even once.
 * Master mystic ('p')- He can kick you 'til you fall down, then kick
 you 'til you die. He's good at it, too.
 * Nightwing ('W')- Rarely worth it.
 * Time Hound ('Z')- I know I lumped all hounds together above, but
 these babies deserve a special mention.
 * Grand Master Mystic ('p')- Need I say more?
 * Nightcrawler ('W')- Rarely worth it.
 * Druj of all sorts ('s')- These things can vaporize you. If you're
 standing outside a graveyard, prepare to meet your maker.
 * Aether vortex ('v')- More irritating than a Time vortex.
 * Azriel, Angel of Death ('A')- Probably the number one killer of
 veteran players who choose to face him. Think about that for a
 while.
 * Nightwalker ('W')- Rarely worth it.
 * Dreadlord ('G')- Like a Dreadmaster, only worse.
 * The Cat Lord ('f')- He's fast, and can inflict an ungodly amount of
 damage in a single round- and that's hand-to-hand.
 * Tselakus, the Dreadlord ('G')- Like a Dreadlord, only worse.
 * Black Reaver ('L')- One of the most irritating monsters in the game,
 and a large part of the reason why graveyards are so lethal. Don't
 bother running; it won't do you any good.
 * Ungoliant, the Unlight ('S')- Best thing to hope for is that she
 wastes her time summoning spiders.
 * The Tarrasque ('R')- Probably the number two killer of veteran
 players.

 I didn't want to give out much in the way of spoiler information, so
 let this list serve as a friendly warning. When you see one of these
 babies on your screen, either flee or get ready for a heck of a fight!

4) MONSTERS AS PETS

A friendly creature can be a mixed blessing. At first sight, one might
think that they can make the game much easier. It is of course highly
satisfying to send your pet Hell Wyrm into a Troll pit and wait outside,
listening for the howls of agony and terror, the sounds of guts
splattering, bones crunching and so on. But one should not expect to
gain any experience for such a combat: you will only gain experience
for creatures to whom you deliver the death blow yourself. New
experiences require hazards, nobody gains experience by sitting home
watching the TV. 

Secondly, friendly monsters are often so eager to destroy your
opponents they may forget all about you, and you get trampled under
their feet as they charge at your foe. They are not as smart as the
regular monsters, since they have given up their free will to serve you.
So don't stand next to that Snaga when your pet Cyberdemon
brandishes its rocket launcher! Pets are also rather easily irritable.
Once you do something which causes the slightest discomfort to
them, they will revert to their normal behaviour and consider you their
main target. This is something to think about before lighting up a room
if you have pet orcs. Needless to say, nobody wants to be your friend
if you are aggravating them. 

Finally, it takes a lot of mental energy to maintain the control over the
charmed monsters. The first monster or the first few are 'free', but
after that maintaining the control will start taxing your mana regain
rate. The higher the sum of the levels of your pets the less mana you
will be able to regain. Keep this in mind if you have a pet which can
summon or otherwise produce more pets...

#####R === ToME Magic - Necromancy ===
The art of Necromancy is the foul practice of manipulating the life
force of creatures.

Necromancy powers are accessed using the 'm' key and then selecting
'Use Necromancy'; they are cast with Spell Points, like normal spells,
and do not need light to be performed.

1. [[[[[DHorrify] (Level 1) Cost:2
   Calls upon the dark forces and open a channel into the mind of a
   monster, stunning and scaring it.
   At level 21 it affects all monsters in a beam.
   At level 36 it affects all monsters in a ball.
   At level 46 it affects all monsters in sight.
2. [[[[[DRaise Dead] (Level 5) Cost:6
   This power makes corpses in a small radius from the caster rise as an
   undead ego monster at the service of the caster. The loyalty of those
   monsters is not guaranteed, though. It also heals monsters within the
   same radius.
3. [[[[[DAbsorb Soul] (Level 20) Cost:10
   This heals you by a good amount every time you kill a monster within
   its duration. It is especially useful when your character is in undead
   form (see below)
4. [[[[[DVampirism] (Level 30) Cost:15
   Drains part of the life-force from a nearby monster and gives it to you.
5. [[[[[DUndead form] (Level 30) Cost:N/A
   Not actually an activable power, this kicks in automatically when your
   character would die. Instead, he/she becomes an undead creature with a
   small amount of Death Points (DP). Every normal (+0 speed) turn, one DP
   is lost; you can regain it like you would do with Hit Points.
   If you manage to kill enough monsters before your DP goes below 0, your
   character is brought back to life.
6. [[[[[DDeath] (Level 35) Cost:100
   Yes, the name is not nice. Neither are the effects: the target dies
   immediately, but so does your character (not that death is such a great
   annoyance for necromancers)

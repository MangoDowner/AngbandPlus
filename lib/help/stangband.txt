=== STAngband General Info ===

What am I?

I am an Angband Variant that was made with the ZAngband2.6.2 source
code. I lake adventuring and admiring big dungeons. The main things 
that make me special are: My varied player races, my different classes, 
my tweaked graphics, the Technician class, class abilities, my mystical 
magic system, 2 new statistics and several other special tweaks.

My magic system is the same as Zangband's except that there are more
realms and they are differently flavoured. I have 10 different
realms. There are 4 Arcane realms: Life, Death, Order and Chaos. 
4 Elemental realms: Fire, Water, Earth and Air.  Plus 2 metamagic 
realms: Astral and Wizardry.

A lot of my new classes have special class abilities. The 
Technician classes use these class abilities as well as Mindcrafter.
Technicians use one of the new stats, like spell points, to do
things like creating items. The other new stat, Fatigue, is used
to make it harder for casters continuously using their highest level
spells. Fatigue is also increases when permanent spells like identify
and brandings are cast. Fatigue also lets warriors use their spin 
attack without costing valuable hit points.

=== STAngband Tips ===

<1> Read the Help files:
     The help files have been made for you to read, at any time, any
     dungeon level. Don't understand something? Look it up.

<2> Word of Recall:
     Word Of Recall is your friend! It is the only way for you to 
     travel quickly between the dungeon and the towns. It is hard
     to use as an escape spell though, as it takes time to activate.

<3> Equipment:
     You have a variety of equipment slots, try to fill them. The 
     more armour you have on the less damage you recieve.

<4> Non-Melee Combat:
     The are many way to kill monsters without whacking them with
     a sword. Collect Wands, Rods and other things. Use missile
     weapons. Before diciding your missile weapon skill is too
     low, equip a missile launcher to check for bonusses with
     that type of launcher.

<5> Rumours:
     Read the Rumours.

<6> Rumours:
     Don't read the Rumours.

<7> Feedback:
     Found a bug? Something too easy? Something too hard? Going
     to explode if you don't tell anybody your idea?
     Email me. It will probably be more interesting than Spam.

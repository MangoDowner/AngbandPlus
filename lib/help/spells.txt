effects available for each schools of spells. Descriptions
follows the following template:

NAME OF THE SPELL
Effect: What the spell does.
Mana Cost: The base mana cost per power points. Note that
	   many spells halve or multiply this base cost when
	   calculating the total cost. This only gives you
	   a basic idea of the effect's cost.

	    to cast. All effects that don't have a power parameter
	    have a fixed cost.

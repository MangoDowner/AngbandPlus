area (min lev = 20), providing you with temporary ESP (min lev = 25) and 
revealing the layout of the whole level (min lev = 45).

This fires a bolt of psychic energy. Sometimes, this bolt will explode into a 
ball. It is more likely to become a ball if you are higher level.

it (min lev = 25), you can choose your destination.

you can use this power at a distance.

also give you temporary resistance to acid (min lev = 14), fire (min lev = 20), 
cold (min lev = 25), electricity (min lev = 30) and poison (min lev = 35).

temporary boost to your speed, and boosts your fighting ability. With practice

targets and channels the mental energy back to you, which you absorb as spell 
points.

#####R === T.o.M.E. Magic - Crusade Realm ===

Drawing power from both divine and sorcerous sources, the Crusade 
realm seeks to aid the warrior in battle. Its spells are aimed at 
enhancement of fighting abilities as well as directly dealing damage
to the enemy. Wielded by holy warriors, it is not as powerful as the
major realms, but one who uses it can be a formidable threat to any 
monster.

The Crusade Realm contains some attack spells, some combat-enchancing
spells, some utility spells and a few healing spells.

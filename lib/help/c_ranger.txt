#####R=== Rangers ===

#####GDescription
Rangers are warrior/mages, devoted to nature. They are good fighters, 
and quite effective with bows. The ranger learns spells much more slowly
than a mage, but is capable of learning their choice of spells in their 
realm. Rangers have good stealth, perception, searching, saving throws,
and are good with magical devices.

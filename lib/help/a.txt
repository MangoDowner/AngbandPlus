-------

Humans are the predominant race in Portralis. They are everywhere, 
in every kingdoms, except perhaps Rhyzendal. From major cities to 
small, rural towns, to wild forests and jungles, to mountains, 
humans are found in every single parts of the world. They were 
the first to arrive in Portralis milleniums ago, and ever since 
they built the first kingdom of Jindar, they have been the most 
widespread and possibly the most powerful of the races.

Physically, humans are pretty average, and have no particular strengths
or weaknesses. However, they tend to learn easily and quickly, and will 
generally become very skilled at whatever profession they choose. Also, 
humans are known to be creative, and are known to make good scientists, 
crafters and alchemists. This ability to create and adapt makes humans
known to be a very intelligent race. They are also very diplomatic, and
know how to persuade and rule their peoples, as well as all other races.
Human wizards tend to favor the Conjuration school of magic.

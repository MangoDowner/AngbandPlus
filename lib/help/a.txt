HUMAN
-------

Humans are the most abundant race in the world. They rule the
major kingdoms and empires. Because there are humans everywhere,
they often come in contacts with the other races, and humans
are known for being a fertile specie, being able to breed with
elves, orcs and others. A human does not possess any particular
abilities, nor do they possess any signifiant disadvantages, but
since they have a short life span compared to most other races,
they tend to learn things a bit quicker.

ADVANTAGES: Gain levels a bit faster than other races

DISADVANTAGES: -None

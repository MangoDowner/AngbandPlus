#
# This is a list in chronological order of previous games of Cthangband,
# provided for statistical purposes (e.g. do I survive longer in the orc tower
# or the sword vault?).
# The game never reads from it, so it can be safely imported to all future
# versions.
#
# Its format is (on one line):
# V:version UI:UID Ti:Time and date Sc:Score Tu:Turns HP:Max hit points at death
# Ki:Killed by... Dp:Depth Du:Dungeon Sx:Sex Ra:Race Tm:Template Na:Name
#
# On single user systems, the UI field is omitted.

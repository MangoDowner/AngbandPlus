                           Rules of the Arena
                           ------------------

The Arena is a contest pitting the best against each other.

There are several types of arenas, each specialising in different
areas. There is an arena especially suited for humanoid monsters, an
arena for animals and monstrosites, and best of all, an arena 
specifically for magic-users. 

In all arenas, throwing and archery is fobidden, to ensure a fair
contest. In the first three arenas, magic is NOT ALLOWED. That means
no potions, wands, spells, scrolls, etc. In the magical arena, on the
other hand, hand-to-hand combat is expressly fobidden. 

If fortunate, you will face the arena Champion, survivor of countless
previous fights, considered one of the best fighters in the world.
Defeat him or it and claim the prize of 10,000 gold pieces.

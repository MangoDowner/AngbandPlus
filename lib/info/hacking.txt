=== Hacking on PosBand === (last updated for v0.9.0)

PosBand is a variant of Angband, and inherits rich possibilities of
customization from it.  This file gives a brief summary of what you can do
with PosBand.

--> Source layout

Makefile.am (all directories)

	Makefile template for GNU Automake utility.  Normally you should
	change only these makefiles.  See GNU Automake and GNU Autoconf
	documentation (I pity you :).

Makefile.in, Makefile (all directories)

	Automatically generated Makefiles.

acinclude.m4

	Macros for configure.in file.

aclocal.m4, compile, config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, install-sh, missing,
mkinstalldirs

	Various automatically generated files for configure script.
	You shouldn't need to change them.

configure.ac

	"Source" for configure script.  This is the place for adding new
	checks, etc.  configure and makefiles can be regenerated by
	invokind autoreconf.

configure

	Configure script.  Automatically generated, change configure.ac
	instead.

lib/apex/scores.raw

	High scores file in binary, platform-independent format.  See
	src/files.c for high score routines.

lib/bone

	Unused in PosBand (hmm, I should remove it someday).

lib/data

	Binary files automatically generated by PosBand from text data
	files from lib/edit to speed up reading.  To the best of my
	knowledge, these _are_ platform-dependent.  Normally they
	are regenerated from lib/edit/*.txt files automatically, but
	in some odd cases (e.g. you have changed some structures
	in the source, but didn't actually alter *.txt files yet)
	you may get bogus error messages.  Just remove all *.raw files.

lib/edit/artifact.txt

	Artifact definitions in text form.  See comments in this file for
	details.

	PosBand is based on Tolkien writings (arguably even more so than
	Angband), and you should keep the Tolkien theme.  Don't add artifacts
	from other sources.  If you have invented your own artifact, consider
	naming it in Sindarin, using the dictionary from The Silmarillion.
	If you have added artifact from Tolkien, insert a quote about
	this artifact.

	Due to hard-wired limitations of Angband code, the first 16 (0...15)
	artifacts should be light sources/rings/amulets, and all others
	should be weapons and armor.

lib/edit/cost_adj.txt

	A short table with cost adjustments, which depend on shopkeeper and
	player race.  To keep this table from growing enormously, we assume
	that all moster races are generally disliked by all shopkeepers,
	and 125% cost adjustment is used.

lib/edit/ego_item.txt

	Ego item definitions.  See comments for details.

	Descriptions for ego items are generally not recommended.  Add them
	only if it isn't obvious what the item is for (e.g. ammo of Wounding).

lib/edit/flavor.txt

	"Flavors" for potions, scrolls, wands, staffs and rods.  Order doesn't
	matter.  If you have added a new item, add one more flavor for that
	item class in this file.

lib/edit/limits.txt

	Limits for internal game structures and array.  Increase them if the
	game begins to complain.  You can add some reserve (after all,
	this is 2005 and a few kilobytes don't matter anymore), but don't
	make it very large.

lib/edit/monster.txt

	Monster definitions.  See comments for details.

	Monster #0 is a "player" template.  It is never generated, but some
	attributes (e.g. character and slots) of this entry are used.

lib/edit/object.txt

	Object definitions.  See comments for details.

	Object (object kinds, to be precise) can be internally identified by
	the game either by index (from 'N' lines), or by tval/sval (from 'I'
	lines).  Tval is a number representing the "class" of objects;
	sval is a number representing the object from that class.  See
	src/object.h for a list of tvals and svals.

ID by use
---------
Wieldable abjects can be learned about by wielding and using them.  Ego weapon
and armour types can be learned by learning an identifying property.  

Score
-----
Score is now the sum of the experience gained for the first kill of every 
monster type.  This is an attempt to make score actually meaningful.

Rings and Amulets
-----------------
These are completely different now.  Basic ring types are metals; basic amulet 
types are gems.  All rings and amulets are ego items.  ID by use is "sensation-
based" (otherwise known as rune-based) for jewellery.

Birth Options
-------------
There are two new birth options:

- dungeon only gives the player a conventional Angband town-and-dungeon game 
(although there are optional fixed quests on the way down, and recall is 
*necessary* after a while);

- no selling is like it says on the box - items can be donated to shops for 
identification, and gold drops are doubled.

Sound
-----
Dubtrain's sound pack is now fully incorporated.

Bugfixes and minor changes

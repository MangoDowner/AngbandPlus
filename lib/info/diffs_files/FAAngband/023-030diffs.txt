Code Cleanup/Modernisation
--------------------------
Massive.  Started with some cleanups provided by Christer Nyfalt, then moved 
on to importing most of the low level code from Angband 3.0.9ish  - z-* files, 
initialisation, sdl and gtk ports, display modules, compilation process, 
Pete Mack's menu code, command menus, squelch, birth process, context help, 
file viewing, auto-wielding at birth.


Percentage resistances
----------------------
Resistances are now percentages, applied multiplicatively (which is really 
just the old points system with increased precision).  20% resistance is now 
the threshold for immunity from effects (so 20% or more RConf will mean the 
player can't be confused), except poison which is 80%.

Major overhaul of items, particularly egos as a consequence:

- Armour, shields of Resist Acid, Fire, Lightning and Cold have gone, and of 
  Resistance now has at least one, usually low, resist, likely to be more as 
  you get deeper.  

- Elvenkind armour (and now shields) now get RBase at least one extra resist, 
  although that can occasionally be extra in a low resist.  

- Rings of protection give a small amount of resistance to at least one element
  - cursed ones give vulnerability.  

- Armour/shields ofulnerability are the cursed versions of Resistance.  

- The one extra resist of other items (Cloaks of Aman, etc) is treated as for 
  Elvenkind.

- All ordinary and ego resists are randomised by up to a quarter, so the 
  nominal 40% base resists on Elvenkind armour each end up between 30% and 50%.

- Artifacts have varying levels of resistance (and/or vulnerability), not
  randomised.


Element proofing
----------------
Items can now be proofed against acid, fire, cold and electricity by scrolls
of *proofing - these are deep and fairly rare.

Random artifacts
----------------
Randarts have been overhauled and powered up a bit.  Randart rings and amulets
now exist, with some of the rings being potentially very powerful - this is to
make up for the lack of the Rings of Power in FA.  

Good (ie not cursed) artifacts may have elemental vulnerabilities.

Mouse interface
---------------
This has been cleaned up a lot, with the hackish clicking on words in prompt
lines replaced by a context-sensitive system of "buttons" (eg [ESC]) on the 
bottom line of the screen.  I'll post more details of this separately, as the 
plan is to include it (or something like it) in Vanilla.

Character screens
-----------------
The character screens (from the 'C' command) have been replaced by a scrolling,
coloured version of the character dump.  Player notes have been coded more
cleanly (similar to a proposal in the angband-dev mailing list), and
colourised :).  Subwindow display of character details are a now a subset of 
this.

Resistances -> Powers
---------------------
RBlind and RFear have become powers rather than resists, so random resist
items (like Elvenkind armour) can't get them but random power items (like
Blessed weapons) can.

Odds and Ends
-------------
- Changed some randart names to be more thematically consistent or avoid
  standard artifact names.

- elven druids/rangers get their speed bonus in trees rather than on forest 
  levels now.

- tweaked racial properties, including removing the Dark Elf vulnerability to
  light and giving humans evasion rather than a to-hit bonus in their 
  preferred terrain.

- gave druids some cool new spells, and better HP.

- gave trap setting and martial arts specialties to more classes

- made the "turns to fight" message only appear for monsters going from 
  frightened to not.

- added more speed to rings of Warfare, added Boots of Elvenkind and Amulets 
  of Sustenance.

- made catastrophic failure of wand recharge less catastrophic (destroys 2 of 
  a stack then a roll for subsequent ones rather than the whole stack)

- removed all birth options (maximise and preserve now always on, stat choice
  is on the birth screen)

- made rivers weave a bit more

- made sure wilderness vaults are not too close to the player to make instakill
  on entering a level less likely

- tidied up options a little

- updated the standard player ghosts (probably avoiding a defamation suit)

- prompt for destroying on pickup

Bugfixes
--------
- Monsters were mostly not trying to break runes of protection (Si Griffin)

- Some high value randart properties (like telepathy) were not possible, and
  the randart generation could hang sometimes (Me!)

- some tvals in the Magic Shop were wrong, so the wrong items were being 
  stocked (Pete Mack)

- made Unlight stealth bonuses update correctly (Dario Saccavino)

- made {cursed} appear immediately on wielding a cursed item (ekolis)

- overhead map in mini-window wasn't working properly (someone - sorry!)

- Underworld had light (Arralen)

- Mountaintops didn't (Si Griffin)

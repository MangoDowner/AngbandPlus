Nan Dungortheb 
--------------
This is no longer a dungeon as such, although it still has a guardian.  It is
now a sunless valley, full of trees and spiderwebs, with cliffs to fall off
and no way back up except recall.  Specifically:

 - web is a new type of terrain.  It can be removed in a single turn by player
(using the 'T' command) or monster, but spiders and PASS_WALL and KILL_WALL
monsters can go straight through, and insects get stuck.  It can be burnt by 
fire, and does not block line of sight.  There are vault-equivalent areas of 
web, good gear and nasty spiders.

 - empty space is a new type of terrain.  Only flying monsters or player as a
bat can exist in it; anything else falls.  If the player falls, they can fall
more than one level, and be hurt, cut and stunned.  Sleeping a flying monster
in empty space is fun.

 - as in dungeons, there is no daylight.

 - the only way off a level is down, teleport level or recall.

 - there are many spiders.


Stores
------
 - each town now has its own distinct set of stores - so that's now 50 
different stores.

 - storekeeper races are town-dependent.  Races whose home the town is are most
likely, but others are possible - so, for example, Longbeards are quite likely
in Belegost, but less likely in Menegroth.

 - there is a new type of store, the Travelling Merchant (entrance '0').
This shop replaces the General Store in small towns.  It sells a range of 
General Store type items, weapons and armour, but at a premium price.  
Anything you sell the Merchant will be stashed in his travelling bag rather 
than resold straight away.  It is also possible to put in an order for the 
regular spellcaster books, and most potions and scrolls that have already 
been identified; if you return later, the merchant may have stocked some of 
your desired item.


Monster shapechanges
--------------------
 - some monsters (with the SHAPECHANGE flag) can temporarily change shape.
This is different from polymorph; the shapechanger will resume their original
form after a little while, or on death.  For the most part, monsters will
shapechange into something they could have summoned; there are some low level
exceptions, and one notable high level exception.


Racial terrain based specialties
--------------------------------
All races now have some terrain based advantage:

 - Green, Grey, High and Dark Elves have a Druid/Ranger-like ability to step
through treed grids in a single turn.  Elven druids and rangers get a 
+3 speed boost in forest and valley levels.

 - Petty-Dwarves, Dwarves and Longbeards get the ability to step through 
rubble in a single turn, and the ability to evade attacks in mountain levels.

 - Easterlings, Hobbits and Beornings get a bonus +5 to hit in plain levels.

 - Edain and Druedain get a bonus +5 to hit in forest and valley levels.

 - Ents get superstealth in forest levels.

 - Maiar can pass through water unhindered.


Spell changes
-------------
 - the deepest books for priests (Wrath of the Valar) and druids (Powers of
Aman) now have their spells named after Valar.  

 - the druid/ranger Detect Living spell now also detects trees.

 - mage spells have been rearranged a little, and they have three new spells:

    - Telekinesis, which fetches a distant non-gold object

    - Blink Monster

    - Magical Throw, which throws an object or weapon with greater than 
normal accuracy, and using INT for impetus instead of STR


Stat potion changes
-------------------
 - there are now two levels of stat potions (idea due to Elliot).  Potions of
Strength, etc start 10 levels earlier than before, and increase the 
pre-modifier value of the relevant stat to a maximum of 18.  Potions of
*Strength* etc have the same depth/rarities as the old stat potions and have
the same effect - pre-modifer value increases to a maximum of 18/100.


UI improvements
---------------
 - implemented html screendumps.

 - special colours for floor grids option now greys all terrain grids out of 
line of sight.  

 - implemented Andrew Sidwell's trap detect patch, so the DTrap notice at the
bottom of screen comes up whenever the player is on a grid which has been 
covered by trap detection at any point (and regardless of possible trap 
creation since then). 
  
 - implemented NPP colour patch.  This doesn't work properly (on my machine, 
at least) with -mxaw, so I have changed main.c so x11 is the default instead 
of xaw.  

 - colourised the title screen, and added a splash screen on opening and some
new coloured winner screens (so, for example, elves don't die of ripe old age).

 - the 'M' command in wilderness now gives the whole level map, followed
by a regional map showing where and what type the nearby levels are.

 - more complete ego-item descriptions. 

 - included NPP y/n/s squelch prompt on destruction.

 - included ToME-style description (on inspection) of weapon and ammo damage, 
including the effects of any slays, brands and other equipment bonuses that 
are known to the player.


Improvements from Oangband 1.1.0
--------------------------------
 - throwing weapons can be held in the quiver 

 - replaced some occurrences of TV_DRUID_BOOK with SP_WOODSMAN.
  
 - reduced rarity of deepest books.

 - increased sides for basic ammo dice (shots now 1d5, arrows 1d6, bolts 1d7).

 - made dark elf and ent susceptibilities cleaner.

 - added 5% hp boost for Athletics and 5% mana boost for Clarity.

 - fixed non-creation of cursed ego-items.

 - made all teleporting away of monsters bolt, not beam.

Rebalances and map and level generation changes
-----------------------------------------------
 - changed depth of Nargothrond from 70 to 55, and included a new region, 
Eriador South, between Eriador Town and Ered Luin South.  Renamed Anfauglith 
East to Lothlann, Anfauglith West to Anfauglith. 

 -  made pond generation (ie small ponds in wilderness), which was supposed
to be in 0.1.2, work properly.

 - changed quantities of monsters in wilderness so there aren't so many in 
about the level 15-30 wilderness levels.

 - adjusted monster probabilities for locality (animals more likely in 
forests, reptiles in mountains, etc).  Tol-In_Gaurhoth now has a greater
proportion of hounds and undead.

 - made ragged edges for wilderness levels.
 
 - water now slows overburdened players by three times the dry land amount
instead of being a complete barrier.

 - items dropped in trees now don't vanish, but do disappear from sight (like
for grass in Unangband).  

 - made sleeping monsters in trees and rubble unable to dodge spells.

 - recall and teleport level now put the player in the middle of the level.

 - all wilderness monsters are created asleep at night (even hounds).

 - introduced some new artifacts and tweaked a couple of sets.

 - made staves of Teleportation and wands of Teleport Away shallower.  

 - made murder holes run out of ammo 1 in 8 times.  

 - raised both MAX_O_IDX and MAX_M_IDX to 1024 to reduce compacting problems.

 - replaced Gorlim with the Phantom of Eilenel.

 - did easy object stacking - two identical weapons or armours will now stack, 
which amounts to a kind of weak ID, and in particular .

 - made earthquakes in areas with water, lava or empty space more likely to
create more of the same.

 - modified the Unlight specialty so that the player gets a vision radius of
2 when not wielding anything in the light source slot; bonuses are mostly
dependent on not wielding a light, and in some cases on the player grid not
being lit.

 - added Wolves of Sauron (only in Tol-In-Gaurhoth) and Children of 
Ungoliant (only in Nan Dungortheb).

 - Sauron now has S_UNIQUE.


Bug fixes
---------
 - fixed running in towns (which I had broken in 0.1.2).

 - closed exploit where repeated shapechanging gained mana.

 - finally (I think) fixed objects in walls bug, disconnectedness of
mountain levels.
 
 - changed tmpnam(NULL) to tmpfile() in path_temp in util.c to stop 
accumulation of old temporary notes files.

 - fixed player placement bug where playing with autoscum could leave the 
player stuck in a wall when moving between wilderness levels.

 - fixed object description so it shows the object symbol of flavored objects 
in the knowledge screen properly.

 - made !! inscriptions time out correctly.
 
 - made Genocide, Mass Genocide and Word of Destruction actually kill all
the relevant monsters.

 - committed an atrocious hack to eliminate a nasty bug where items were 
being involuntarily squelched (duplicated the squelch field in object_kind
with a sq_info array - urrrgh).

Miscellaneous
-------------
 - got rid of load1.c, renamed load2.c load.c.

 - some other tidying up and reformatting of code.

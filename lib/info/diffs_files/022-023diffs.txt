New features
------------
 - major reduction of monsters in wilderness.  Hounds don't get a boost to 
   generation probability in forests any more (unlike other animals).

 - private user paths now used as in Vanilla, NPP etc.  This is principally
   an improvement for OSX.

 - a few more dungeon vaults added

 - greater wilderness vaults are more common (about 1 in 10 levels at level 10
   up to about 1 in 5 at level 56).

Bugfixes
--------
 - monsters can now be hit by missiles in trees and rubble

 - shop interface works again (so that after choice repeatedly hitting return
   will buy instead of backing out)

 - the player can no longer teleport to land in midair

 - branding works on items in the quiver

 - selecting a brand using the keyboard no longer cancels branding

 - cancelling branding no longer uses the scroll/mana

 - the notes file now records the turn an artifact was picked up rather than 
   when it was identified.  This can lead to out of order entries in the notes
   file, but that was the lesser evil and will be fixed at some later date.

 - resting until sunrise/sunset now works inside

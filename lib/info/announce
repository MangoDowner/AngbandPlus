Subject: [ANNOUNCE] PosBand 0.9.0

The long-awaited new version of PosBand is available at:

* http://posband.earthsea.org/posband/posband-0.9.0.tar.bz2	(Source)
* http://posband.earthsea.org/posband/posband-0.9.0-win.zip	(Windows)
* http://posband.earthsea.org/posband/posband-0.9.0-1.i386.rpm	(Red Hat Linux)
* http://posband.earthsea.org/posband/posband-0.9.0-i386-1.tgz	(Slackware Linux)

This version is released earlier so that the new competition can use PosBand.
It doesn't include all the races I originally planned.

This is the first beta of PosBand.  I believe this version is rather stable.

The summary of changes in this version:

* New features (gameplay):

  - Invisibility. Doesn't prevent monsters from waking up, but makes their
    attacks very random. Standing in the fog also grants invisibility; so does
    standing into your native terrain, if you are an elemental. Note that this
    also applies to monsters, and monsters which are invisible because of
    terrain _cannot_ be seen with SInvis. A number of items can grant either
    temporary or permanent invisibility.
  - Monsters can be genuinely blinded now (it was similated with confusion).
  - Multiple weapon/bow combat is now possible! [1] And as a consequence, hard-
    coded limitations on equipment slots are removed.
  - Fighting and Shooting skills are now split to: Barehanded, Edged weapons,
    Blunt weapons, Polearms, Axes, Slings, Bows, Crossbows, Throwing.
    So pike, throwing axe and long sword are actually different now :).
    Naturally, races who cannot wield weapons get only Barehanded and
    Throwing skills.
  - *ID* service now available in the Guild for 4000gp.
  - Starburst rooms and some new pit types from NPPAngband 0.4.0.

  [1] Note that you cannot fire from two or more bows at the same time, though.
      (You'll have to choose one.) Bows are already overpowered.

* New features (other):

  - Savefiles are now compressed with zlib library (that is, gzipped). Now
    they are just 15-25 Kb large. Notes are now included in the savefile
    (unlike NPP0.4.0, temporary file is usually not created).
  - Autoconf system ported from Vanilla. Building from source on Unix or
    Cygwin should be much easier now.
  - Linux packages for Red Hat (these may work on other Red Hat-like
    systems) and Slackware are provided.
  - The following front-ends are removed in this release:

    o "ami" (Amiga). No one shows any interest [1].
    o "cap" (termcap -- Unix console, *very* simplistic). "gcu" (curses)
      works much better, and everyone has curses libraries.
    o "dos" (DOS graphical). DOS *is* dead. Use Linux.
    o "emx" (OS/2). No one shows any interest.
    o "gtk" (GTK+ -- Unix graphical). Very unfinished, not really usable.
      I could work on it (I do GTK+ programming), but I just don't see
      the point. Use "xaw".
    o "ibm" (DOS text). DOS *is* dead, period. Use Linux.
    o "sla" (S-Lang -- Unix console). Works ok, but "gcu" works well
      enough, and there is no real benefit in using "sla" instead.
    o "vme" (VMS or something like that). No one shows any interest.
    o "x11" (X Window -- Unix graphical). "xaw" looks exactly the same,
      is more configurable, and everyone has Xaw libraries anyway [2].
    o "xpj" (X Window Projected). Pseudo-3D view for Unix. Looks funny,
      but is not really usable.

    [1] "No one shows any interest" means "I have never seen anyone who
        plays any *band on this system since 2003".
    [2] Well, maybe not, but look, I'm not developing software for embedded
        systems, am I? :)

    I may rework display system later, and maybe even add better support
    for graphics -- that's why I removed old code.
  
  - The following front-ends are added in this release:

    o "con" (Windows console)
    o "lfb" (Linux framebuffer)

    Both are available as source patches for other variants on my web site.
  - New hosting. Well, placing the web-site in the subdirectory of another
    web site (on the free hosting!), which wasn't updated in ages, seemed
    just silly. Besides, chat.ru is terribly slow, and its mail does not
    work.  Thanks to Brian Shieh for his help.

* New races:

  - Ant
  - Balrog
    (This race was originally reserved for Bat, but I just can't
    imagine a bat which is powerful enough to take out Morgoth.)
    This is rather interesting race, having both great advantages
    and great disadvantages:
     + Starts with a Sword of Balrog (a ridiculously powerful weapon,
       7d5, (+12,+12), branded with fire, grants IFire and RFear,
       base depth 75, rarity 25).
     + Big stat bonuses
     + Innate IFire, RConfu, RChaos, Regen
     + Really big hit die (30)
     + Aura of fear (all monsters which are close enough must pass
       a saving throw against fear. It could be a disadvantage, too --
       at low level you have to constantly chase everyone)
     - Burning touch (like fire elementals)
     - Aggravation
     - Only big armor and weapons allowed (like giants)
     - Big experience penalty
     - Very poor missile skills
     - Almost no magic
    No idea how balanced/unbalanced they are, but they should be fun
    enough to play. Oh, BTW, before you ask -- no, I don't think
    that Balrogs have wings, so they don't get innate levitation :-).
  - Basilisk
  - Beholder
  - Demon
  - Balance Dragon
  - Blue Dragon
  - Crystal Dragon
  - Green Dragon
  - Inertia Dragon
  - Ghost
  - Golem
  - Naga
  - Paladin
  - Rogue
  - Air Elemental
  - Troll
  - Wraith
  - Yeek

* Bugfixes:

  - Character information screen ('C') is now squeezed on 80x24 terminal
    (old versions needed ~100x32 to display all information). The side effect:
    'C' screen now has 6 pages :). The dump should be now suitable for posting
    in the newsgroup or on the ladder, too.
  - Several character dump bugs fixed.
  - Randart generation (or trying to reforge artifact) could crash PosBand in
    "adult_rand_artifact" games.
  - Finally fixed the bug with incorrect skills calculation (increased
    infravision, bogus skill display on character birth, after transformation
    skills weren't properly updated).
  - Unix console ("gcu") front-end now supports pseudo-graphics properly.
    Got rid of that "font-gcu.prf" file, which didn't work properly with
    ncurses 5.4.
  - Acid and disenchantment attacks couldn't affect items in some slots.
  - Randarts which could be activated for illumination every turn were
    occasionally generated.
  - Finally fixed tailored rewards.
  - Randart price is now equal to the price of template artifact. I didn't
    want to do this, but the way it was before breaks tailored reward
    generation.
  - "Heal pet" power worked only on neutrally-aligned pets.
  - The game could try to reward monster character with a spellbook -- and
    since monsters have no spellbooks, it would fall back on random reward.
  - Reforged light sources could be refilled.
  - Rods of Perception could be used without recharging.
  - Decayed levels removed. They were ugly and non-playable anyway.
  - All monsters in pits/nests have the same alignment now. In older versions
    you could just wait until pit monsters slaughter each other, finish
    the survivors and collect the loot.
  - "Monster-monster" nether bolt attack was actually cast on player.
  - Hopelessly out of date help file manual.txt removed.
  - Help updates -- amazing but true <g>.
  - Some typos fixed.
  - Some bugfixes from NPPAngband 0.4.0.
  - Code cleanup. Header files reorganised. Some unused code removed.
    PosBand probably won't run on DOS, and I seriously doubt anyone still
    plays *band on DOS, so DOS compatibility kludges were removed. Use
    Windows console front-end ("con"), if you want to play in full-screen
    text mode on Windows.

I dropped "-beta1" suffix, what's the point of it anyway.

Thanks to everyone for all the feedback.

This time, old savefiles are _incompatible_.  Sorry.

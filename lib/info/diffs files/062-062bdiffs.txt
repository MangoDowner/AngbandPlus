Items:
- Made Rings of Speed more rare, but added Rings of Eregion and Rings
  of Warfare which grant smaller speed bonuses and other effects.

Specialties:
- Evasion again depends on Dex and Armor weight, but still gives a 
  fixed "dodge" chance rather than an AC boost.  Still very strong
  vs missile attacks.

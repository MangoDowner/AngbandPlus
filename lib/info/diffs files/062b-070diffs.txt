Player resistances:
- Instituted a system of incremental resists for the player.  The
  current known resistance percentage is show on the second stat
  screen.

Traps:
- All monster trappers get an extra trap at level 25.
- Monster trappers with the Extra Trap get an extra trap, as 
  well as learning advanced traps faster and gaining some new
  advanced traps at high levels: Drain Life [NPP], Unmagic, Dispel 
  Monsters [NPP].

Information for specialty/racial/class abilities:
- The "view specialty" interface is now more general, providing
  information about a variety of racial and class-based abilities as
  well as specialties.
- Cleaned up and color coded the interface.
- Got rid of the annoying more on the learn/view abilities prompt.
- Removed the specialty information from the self knowledge display.

New Specialties:
- New specialty: Mana Burn - may reduce monster mana with melee 
  weapon attacks.  Mana burned hurts the target.
- New specialty: Trap Setting - as the basic Rogue ability, though
  with lower disarming skill.
- New Specialty: Channeling - provides a bonus similar to heighten
  magic, but depending on the casters current mana level.
- New specialty choices: Trap Setting (Warriors and Rangers), Mana
  Burn (Rogues and Assassins), Harmony (Paladins), Channeling
  (all spellcasters).

Items:
- The "bonus" ability for the Green DSM shapeshift is changed from
  Regeneration to Poison immunity.

Classes:
- Increased Ranger pseudo-id speed.
- Gave Rangers another +1 strength, +1 to hit dice.
- Tweaked missile skill and weapon specific bonuses for Rangers.  This
  is a cleanup with little net effect.
- Increased the number of starting arrows for Rangers, and gave some
  shots to Assassins.

Misc:
- Greatly reduced the distance penalty to accuracy for ranged attacks.
  All throws/shots have a "point blank" range equal to half their max
  range (up to 10 squares) over which they incur no penalty.
- Unresisted disenchantment attacks now reduce monster and player
  mana, and dispel magic on the player.
- The dispel magic monster spell is more effective at low spell power.
- The dispel magic monster spell is slightly more likely to be cast.
- Many more high level monsters now cast dispel magic.
- The Beorning default shapeshift now requires a player turn to
  activate.
- Added a monster mana bar [NPP].
- Changed windows settings to look nicer by default with "bizarre"
  windows.

Upgrades:
- Created p_class.txt; this controlls pretty much everything
  class-dependant except magic and chest drops.  These   may be 
  added in a future release.
- Removed more magic numbers from code [Christer Nyfalt].

Bugs fixed:
- Mushrooms of Poison and Potions of Poison do not identify when
  eaten.
- Aman, Elvenkind, and Permanance ego items fail to generate random
  high resists.
- Enhance Magic is too effective with temporary resists.
- Resist Light/Dark from the specialties Holy Light/Unlight is not
  displayed on stat screen (resistance does work).
- Necromancer Orb of Death is bugged - does way too little damage.
- Some saving throws are miscalculated.
- Damage from weak Light attacks is really screwed up.
- No display of heightened magic for necromancers.
- Minor rounding inconsistency in heighten magic display vs actual
  effects.
- Sauron is missing the Morgul Magic flag.
- Several item descriptions are missing spaces between words.
- '/' command still says 'A' symbols represent angels.
- Identify/recharge spells drain mana if cancelled.
- Help files inconsistent with implementation of Acid Immunity.
- Unlight bonuses apply when they should not.
- Unlight allows dodging of missiles while blind (added by mistake).
- Non-moving monsters may move when the player has superstealth.
- Perfect Balance price adjustment was being skiped for items with
  no pval.
- Changed a couple of staff flavor colors.

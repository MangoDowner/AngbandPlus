Bugfixes
--------

Minor errors in player histories

Error placing wilderness vaults which was causing crashes (fixed by Si Griffin)

Vampire shapechanges in light work correctly

Pre-030 savefiles were giving all imported objects 100% resistance to 
everything (found by Seany Clayton)

Some randart rings still showing AC pre ID; some others were too shallow and
common (Si Griffin)

'p' and 's' now work for buying and selling in stores

Hidden squelchable things still appeared in the floor menu, despite not being
'l'ookable at

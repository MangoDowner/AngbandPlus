New features
------------
 - added Christophe Cavalaria's mouse patch, using Andrew Doull's pathfinding
   algorithm from UnAngband.  

 - made messages accessible from death screen. 

 - added some more complaints.  

 - made molds release spores, not hit.  

 - added slings to the merchant.

 - changed heavy weapon dice a la Oangband1.1.0.  

 - objects now disappear from view in rubble

 - added ***WINNER*** to line 7 of chardump (for recognition on oook).

 - added house moves and specialty learning to notes file.  

 - added an option to write the notes file to the save directory in an attempt 
   to get around a problem in some newish versions of XP where the notes file
   was not permitted to be written

Bugs fixed
----------
 - possible to attempt ordering from any store, including the home

 - targetting left a track of stars; targetting of grids in the walls outside
   towns was possible

 - game crashed when a monster tried to use teleport_towards and found no 
   vacant floor grids - common in swamps.

 - the character dump code was failing to find the home inventory

 - the observe command output was messed up if used on a weapon which would 
   normally give a message when changed to (edged weapons for priests, 
   double-handed weapons, etc)

 - objects would disappear from view when the player is blind

 - teleport level in Nan Dungortheb would land the player in Nowhere Town

 - hostile teleport could land a player over an abyss without them falling 

 - html dumps work better

 - colours now work in xaw (from new NPP - thanks Diego)

 - regional maps don't allow collisions any more (I hope)

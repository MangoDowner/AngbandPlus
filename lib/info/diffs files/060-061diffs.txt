Specialties:
- Reworked Fury to provide a temporary, quickly decaying speed boost
  when damaged
- Druid Power Strikes occur a little less often.
- Power Strikes (from Druid Power Strike or Warrior Martial Arts)
  don't always try to confuse anymore.
- Evasion: max bonus is now based on Dex (and capped by player level
  at low levels).  The result is a little less at level 1, about the
  same at level 10-15, a lot less until stat gain, and about the same
  for a maxed out character.
- Evasion: allowed armor weight is now based on purely on Strength.
- Athletics and Clarity now give +2 stat bonuses.  Bug fix: stat
  bonuses actually apply now.
- Harmony now restores a fraction of your max hitpoints (4-10% based
  on the mana cost of the spell).
- Soul Siphon gives a LOT more mana for high level monster kills.
- Soul Siphon has lower mana burn damage potential (and fixed a mana
  burn bug).
- Unlight bug fix: grants resist darkness.
- Magic Resistance bug fix: was adding too much to saving throws.

Items:
- Added an explicit "SLAY_KILL" flag for weapons of *Slay* foo.  Could
  potentially put it on other items.
- Made Wands of Clone Monster very rare, deep items.
- Added 2 artifact short bows (Amrod and Amras) from Angband.
- Added squelch on ID for digging tools.

Monsters:
- Added monster "DISPEL" spell (adapated from Hengband) for Morgoth,
  Sauron, the Mouth of Sauron, Vecna, and Hand drujs.  Does allow a
  (hard) save, but can also regain mana for the caster.  Due to lack
  of playtesting, this spell is currently not cast very often.
- Reduced monster archery damage by 17.5%
- Reworked Living Dungeons (less hps, but more damage and spit acid)

Misc:
- More generous warnings when trying to enter lava.
- Reduced the ranges of all player abilities to teleport monsters.

Other Bug Fixes:
- Occasional display bug in max mana when ending shapeshifts.
- Weapon weight allowances fixed (were too high for high level
  characters).
- Corrected trap detection warning after teleport.
- Fixed some incorrect shield bash damage values on certain artifact 
  shields (were too low).
- Fixed a bug causing the saving throw bonuses from temporary magic 
  defenses to be too good.

New Feature:
- Specialty abilities - see lib/help/specialt.txt

Experience:
- Removed exp/score penalties; added 'difficulty' ratings for races
- Redid exp table.  Compared to a Half-elf Mage in the old system you
  will reach:
	10th level much faster     (390 vs 513)
	20th level somewhat slower (6900 vs 5940)
	30th level somewhat slower (111000 vs 101250)
	40th level much faster     (945000 vs 1350000)
	50th level about the same  (6000000 vs 6075000)
- Reduced exp for spell casting

Balance tweaks:
- Increased damage from poison breath and poison ball spells
- Increased persistent poison damage at low levels
- Elves better stats; they are now a Moderate/Low difficulty race
- Ents slightly better stats; also a Moderate/Low difficulty race
- Rangers slightly better stats
- Druids slightly worse stats

Player attacks:
- Changed throwing weapon crits to be useful at high levels
- Druids use deadliness for attack quality and skill for stunning
- Number of barehanded attacks increases at levels 20 and 40
- Archery (not thrown weapons) attacks continue after misses and
  may hit later targets, though at reduced accuracy
- Black Breath attacks (from high level Necromancers) now interfere
  with monster healing and curing spells, as well as normal regen
- All player special attacks are now displayed in bigscreen status
  area

Rogue's Monster Trap:
- Player disarming skill is now used in determining trap effectiveness
  (high disarming makes traps harder to avoid and disarm, and gives a
  chance to do higher damage)
- Trap damage no longer depends on monster hit points
- Monster that keep getting hit by traps without seeing the player
  become less susceptible
- Rogues now have many kinds of monster trap; to use them:
	Lay a basic trap with the usual "alter terrain" command '+'
	Lay another trap on the same spot as the basic trap to upgrade it
	The choice of trap upgrades increases with player level
	See the help file combat.txt for more details

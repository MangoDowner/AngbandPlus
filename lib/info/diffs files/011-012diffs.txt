Changes from 0.1.1:

 - There is now a proper run command for wilderness.  Running (for example) 
   east will run east or north-east or south-east for as many steps as possible
   on paths or grass (if no path available), stopping if there is a north-east/
   south-east choice or for the usual disturbances.

 - Panel movement is controllable by a user-set parameter.  Previously there
   were two modes: normal, where the displayed panel moved when the player got 
   within 2 grids of the top/bottom or 4 grids of the sides; and the
   center_player option, where the panel moved on every step.  The parameter 
   allows for a range of panel movement between these two extremes. 

 - A visible monster window is now available

 - Paths off the level to the south are no longer the same colour as grass

 - Description of the quiver in character dumps has been tidied up

 - Murder holes now vanish after being set off once, so they can't be scummed
   for ammo.

 - A number of the UI changes from Oangband 1.1.0, namely strong squelch, 
   targetting interface (in part originally from NPP) and object knowledge 
   interface (originally from EyAngband (I think), and like the existing FA
   monster knowledge interface, which came from NPP and probably originally
   from Ey as well.  Or Un.  Anyway, kudos to whoever did it first).


Bugs Fixed from 0.1.1

- Walk-through permanent walls in swamps 

- Down stairs and trapdoors on quest levels finally nailed (I hope)

- Desert levels being way too easy

- Messy formatting of continued entries in character notes

- Some monster and object descriptions had incorrect spacing

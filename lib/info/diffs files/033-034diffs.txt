Features
--------

- Reworked dragons.  There are now four levels of dragons - worms (roughly as
  strong as young dragons used to be), drakes (mature dragons), dragons 
  (ancient dragons) and winged dragons (great wyrms).  Only winged dragons can 
  fly, and they are faster and breathe nastier stuff than the lower level ones.
  There is a new breath element, dragonfire, which is half fire and half poison;
  also, storm and ice can now be breathed.  Winged dragons are only found in
  Angband.

- Morgoth has lost speed and gained spellcasting power, especially summoning.

- Implemented Sangband-style terrain flags - although there is still more
  functionality to be added.  Each feature now has a description in the 
  '~' knowledge screens.  Other visible changes include traps in trees, and 
  two types of tree.

- *ID* no longer exists - ordinary ID fully identifies everything.  A future
  release will rework pseudo-ID.

- Thralls now get waybread instead of regular food.

- Made 'I'nspecting an object print at the top of the regular screen, not load
  a special screen.

- Added NPP-style accented characters for the Macintosh, Windows, SDL and x11
  ports (but not WinCE or gtk).  No accents in random names yet.

- Added Hugo Kornelis' 'h'andle command - 'h' can be used to aim a wand, quaff
  a potion, etc etc.

- Made stairs and wilderness paths not take any energy

- Added average barehand damage for druids/martial artists to 'C' screen

- Included a "small device" birth option which reduces all view, missile and 
  spell projection distances by half.  This is intended for playing on very 
  small WinCE devices and (soon, I hope) the Nintendo DS.

- Added lots more wilderness vaults and imported some new dungeon vaults from
  vanilla.  Changed wilderness vault frequencies so that vaults specific to a
  particular type of wilderness are more common relative to generic ones.

- Made amnesia only lose map knowledge, not object knowledge.

Bugfixes and cleanup
--------------------

- made ARC_ spells work.

- fixed bug that was giving set items the wrong percentage resistance

- randarts and egos no longer get immunities when they shouldn't; the maximum 
  percentage non-immunity resist for a single item is now 80%. (Arralen, Si
  Griffin)

- fixed (yet again...) bug where HP/SP were being lost on saving and reloading.
  (Si Griffin)

- did fix from NPP to make tunnelling/immaterial monsters disturb the player
  in a more reasonable way.  (Si Griffin)

- stopped space from selecting the first menu item - instead it toggles the menu
  (as it should have all along).  (Eddie Grove, Remuz)

- made some improvements to macros, although keymap triggers still don't play
  very nicely with inscriptions.

- birth options are no longer labelled as cheat options in character dumps (Si
  Griffin)

- game no longer becomes bizarre when a half-caster attempts to browse one of 
  the unused books of the correct realm (Si Griffin)

- may have got rid of some excessive beeping (darkDrone)

- fixed x11 default fonts (Bandobras)

- fixed amusing bug where thrall mode had multiple players (me, Si Griffin, 
  Seany Clayton, HallucinationMushroom)

- removed redundant roff and c_roff printing functions

- dragon scale mail can no longer give vulnerability (Si Griffin)

- "Underworld Town" and related silliness should no longer appear in the
  character notes

- replaced hard-coded limits, so that all limits appear in limits.txt (with an
  exception for loading artifacts that will need attention at some point).

- pseudo-IDed items now stack consistently

- patched a couple of memory leaks

- fixed incorrect (fro FA) vault encoding in some vaults previously taken from 
  vanilla - now less food to be found in vaults :)

- fixed bug with pathfinding through trees and rubble only getting the player 
  half as far as expected. (Si Griffin)

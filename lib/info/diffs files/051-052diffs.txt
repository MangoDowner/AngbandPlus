Changes in 0.5.2

Races:
	- The Beornings player race has been added.  Beorning are
	  similar to humans in their normal form, but can shapeshift
	  into bears whenever needed (use the ']' command).
	- Bear form gives bonuses to combat, AC, STR, and CON, and
	  penalties to magic devices, bows/throws, and mana.
	- The bonuses in bear form start out fairly moderate, but grow
	  with player level.
	- Beornings make great Rangers, Warriors and Priests and are
          generally good in all classes except Mage and Necromancer.

Monsters:
	- Multi-hued monsters now only switch between the colors of
	  their breath weapons, if applicable.
	- The WOUND spell is greatly toned down at high levels, but
	  unchanged at low and mid levels.
	- Some ranged attacks will close on the player more readily.

Set Items:
	- Item sets have been added.  These combinations of artifacts
	  gain powers (flags and pval) when all weilded together.  You
	  will be notified when a set item is identified.  Thanks to
	  Gail Shaw for her work on this.
	- The current item sets are: "Elven Gifts", "Shadow Ward",
	  "Flame of Wrath", "Eorl's Arms", and "Gil-Galad's Battle
	  Gear".  All consist of two items, and some are fairly
	  low-level.  Have fun discovering these!
	- Expect future versions to include more sets, some with more
	  items.  An info file will definitely be added in the
	  future.

Item Selection:
	- When selecting items, and there are valid items on the
	  floor, typing '.' will select the first valid item from the
	  floor.  This is regardless of whether the floor list is
	  currently being viewed.

Combat System:
	- There has been a general revision of the Combat system by
	  Leon Marrick.  The version in this release has some
	  differences from that in the standard Angband patch.
	  Generally, while big heavy weapons are still best for those
	  who can handle them, lighter ones are more competitive under
	  the new system.  Slays and brands are even more important
	  than before, especially for smaller weapons.
	- Critical hits now add damage dice (usually 2 in melee and 1
	  ranged).  This makes lighter weapons more better, as they
	  benefit more.
	- Brands and Slays now add damage as well as multiplying it.
	  This means that brands are sometimes more important than
	  base damage dice, especially for lighter weapons.
	- 5 and 6 attacks are now possible but only for fairly extreme
	  combinations of strength, dexterity and weapon weight.
	- The attacks/round calculation is more generous, but not so
	  generous as that in the standard Angband patch this update
	  is based on.  Dexterity has been made more important
	  at the high end of the scale, but little changed on the
	  lower end.
	- Several weapons were tweaked to better fit the new combat
          system.

Archery
	- It is now possible to have fractional shots per round (1.2,
          3.6, etc).
	- Number of shots per round still depends on class and weapon,
          but longer depends on level.  Instead it depends on dexterity.
          Even first level characters may get some exta shots, but only
          very high DEX characters will get their maximum allotment.
	- Class/weapon combos that could get extra shots at high
          levels can gain the same number of shots with enough
          dexerity.  In addition, all characters can get up to 0.5
          extra shots per round with all ranged weapons.
	- Archery is otherwise subject to the new combat system above.

Monster Movement
	- A new monster movement system has been implemented (LM),
          using smarter tracking and removing some ways in which the
          monsters could 'cheat'.
	- Because of the speed of the new movement AI, all flow
          related options have been removed.  All AI/flow related
          compile flags (except MONSTER_FLOW) are removed.
	- Monsters flee more intellegently, flow better over unusual
          terrain, and push each other in a more robust way.

Circular detects:
	- A status display at the bottom of the screen shows the word
	  'DTrap' in yellow if you have detected traps and not moved
	  out of the detect radius.
	- Items of trap detection identify easily.
	- The disturb_trap_detect option will cause a message when
	  leaving the region of your last trap detection.

Classes:
	- Assassin have gained both melee and missile skill.  A high
	  level Assassin with a light enough weapon now has the
	  accuracy of a Warrior.
	- The Rogue's monster trap is modified.  It is nearly
	  unchanged at low levels.  At high levels, it does more
	  damage at first, but is less effective at finishing
	  mosnters.
	- Added some damage to a high level Necromancer spell.

Bug fixes:
	- Many.  Most notably the ammo auto-pickup/encumberance bug.

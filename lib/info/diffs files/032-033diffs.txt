Features
--------

Introduced two new modes of play

- Ironman: The player can never go to an area of less danger (except necessary 
  towns, which are completely empty).  When a dungeon guardian is killed, a 
  portal becomes available to go from the bottom of the current dungeon to a
  choice of locations of the right level.

- Thrall: The player is a thrall who has just escaped through the gate of 
  Angband; homeless, standing in the desert and unable to recall until he or 
  she can reach a town to make a home.

Bugfixes
--------

- show_choice option now works again (Seany Clayton)

- NO_ORDER flag works again (so stat potions can't be ordered from the 
  Merchant) (Si Griffin)

- monsters in trees are safer from NON-(elves/nature lore chars) rather than
  the opposite (karthoum@forum)

- command menu box is now wiped properly in big/dbl/trptile modes (Si Griffin)

- item selection for throwing brings up equipment immediately
  
- selecting two specialties at once no longer makes the second one wrong 
  sometimes (Si Griffin)

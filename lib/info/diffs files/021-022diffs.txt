New features
------------
 - made the game almost completely playable with mouse and no keyboard, to
   enable Si Griffin's Windows CE port to work.  A lot of detail hidden here.
   There is a new help file, mouse.txt, available from the commands and 
   options file.

 - enabled screen width of 48 instead of 80 (using -l option in x11 or menu
   command in windows) - also largely to fit in with Si's port.  Altered many
   screens, prompts etc to fit in small screen mode.  Made an option of 
   printing player stats etc at the bottom of the screen (a little like in 
   Unangband) to allow play in portrait mode on portables.

 - included graphics support (David Gervais tiles, Adam Bolt tiles and 
   original tiles) and bigtile support for x11, xaw and windows; also Andrew 
   Doull's double/triple tile graphics for windows, and extended this to x11.

 - did more modern flavouring with flavor.txt edit file, moved standard .prf
   files from the lib/user directory to lib/pref

 - changed the behaviour of teleport level; it is now possible to go in both
   directions in Nan Dungortheb, and in other wilderness the player can escape,
   but not progress using it.  Put trapdoors back in wilderness.

 - increased magic missile damage

 - in preserve mode, made special feelings only occur with artifacts or greater
   vaults

 - introduced the equivalent of vaults in wilderness of level higher than 10

 - tweaked/renamed/introduced some artifacts

 - added Rapid Fire specialty for rangers (trades some accuracy for more shots)

 - changed map so that the major dungeons are shorter and some wilderness 
   increases two levels at a time

 - items inscribed @v or @f are picked up straight into the quiver (as with =g)

 - amended priority in 'M' map so that 'floors' are shown in wilderness

 - added more complaints

 - added command for resting until the next sunrise or sunset

 - changed 'leaving detection area' warning to before you leave it, not after
   (suggested by Christophe Cavalaria)

 - made flying more consistent

Bugs fixed
----------
 - removed a filename error from Makefile.ibm 

 - home items are now fully ID'd on death

 - dungeon mapping was broken with some light settings

 - monster AI was not taking removed walls into account

 - pathfinding algorithm was starting runs in the opposite direction to what
   was intended

 - 'M' map now works properly in towns

 - saving and reloading was sometimes causing mana loss

last words:
The Giant Worker Ant bites you.
J. K. Banks says: 'Surrender, miserable flea!'
J. K. Banks seems sad about something.
You're not as strong as you used to be...
J. K. Banks gazes at you.
J. K. Banks claws you.
You feel very ugly.
J. K. Banks tells you to get off his land.
You feel your life has clocked back.
J. K. Banks gazes at you.
You turn into an unthinking vegetable.

I plan to change Maggot's words to:
whispers a hair-brained idea.
evokes memories of your misspent youth.
mumbles theorems.
says: 'A natural system cannot exist without a supernatural system'
excitedly discusses rocks.
excitedly discusses cells.
excitedly discusses math.
etc.
Greater and lesser nerds use these in their confusing attacks.

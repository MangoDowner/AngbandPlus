I:Evolia;
T:Well, <NAME>, I welcome you to our temple. It is a humble temple to;
T:Dalunia... nothing like we used to have centuries ago, in the southern;
T:Nimbrayan forests... most of the Nimbrayans now worship Daldumaar... and;
T:sadly, our once great religion is slowly becoming a forgotten cult...;
T:But I have faith that things will change, and that one day, our cult;
T:will regain it's former glory!;

T:I'm afraid there is so much to tell... The origin of life, the appearance;
T:of the goddess, some controversed theories and the code of the;
T:Dalunian Priest. Here, let me give you this parchement. It contains some;
T:general informations about our religion, and all important subjects.;
T:Of course, there is much more to our religion, but that should give you;
T:a good idea of what our religion is all about.;

I:Evolia;
T:As you know, I am a priestess of Dalunia, and the protector of the peoples;
T:of Fidac. I protect the life of the innocent peoples who lives in this;
T:town, mainly from the living dead that comes from the nearby ruins.;
T:You see, Fidac has been built near the site of some ancient ruins.;
T:The ruins are a cursed place, and are haunted by walking corpses of once;
T:living peoples. I already sent some priests to defeat the undeads, but;
T:it seems they always rise again, no matter how many we destroy.;

I:Evolia;
T:Every once in a while, the walking corpses will come near the town.;
T:At first, the attacks were rare, and my priests were able to fend them;
T:off. However, the attacks are becoming more and more frequent. So, in;
T:order to provide permanent protection, I created a holy barrier against;
T:undead enemies. So far, it has worked well to repel them, however,;
T:the barrier takes it's energy directly from the soil. And the more;
T:energy it takes, the less fertile the soil becomes... plants are starting;
T:to die because the barrier takes so much energy, and I don't know how;
T:long it will last...;

I:Evolia;
T:And if our barrier ends up killing the land, this means that we will;
T:have failed in our duty of protecting nature. However, so far, we have;
T:searched the ruins, and found no clues about where and what the source;
T:of the undeads might be. There are rumors about an underground dungeon;
T:or temple, but we did not find any entrance to any kind of underground;
T:places... Some adventurers tried searching the ruins. Most found nothing,;
T:and a few of them never came back... We will never know whether or;
T:not they found anything...;

T:it is too late. Dalunia shall guide us, and the land will be saved from;
T:the living dead!;

T:Hmmm... you seem to be an adventurer, am I right? Right now, our main;
T:concern is the ruins to the northwest, not far from the town. We are;
T:looking for clues about the source of the undead beings... and so far,;
T:we have found nothing. If you could go there and search the ruins, it;
T:would be greatly appreciated. The ruins are a cursed place, and are;
T:haunted by walking corpses of once living peoples. I already sent some;
T:priests to defeat the undeads, but it seems they always rise again,;

T:I can sense that you battled the forces of the undead...;
T:and I can sense that you have put a tormented soul to rest. And I no;
T:longer sense the evil coming from the ruins! <NAME>, you saved the;
T:town of Fidac! You have defeated the undeads, and now, I can finally;
T:remove the magic barrier around the town. The magic barrier was;
T:draining the strength from the earth to remain active, and the soil;
T:was losing it's fertility... which was a shame to us, the temple;
T:of Dalunia.;

T:give you one of our temple's most prized treasure... It is a mace;
T:that has been blessed with the divine powers of Dalunia. It is a;
T:weapon that contains the essence of the earth, and that shall strike;
T:enemies with the wrath of nature! We are... unworthy of wielding this;
T:weapon. We couldn't do anything against the undeads, we couldn't even;
T:find the entrance to their lair... You are much more worthy of wielding;
T:it than we are...;

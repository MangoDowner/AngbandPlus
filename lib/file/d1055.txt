T:Me? Well, I was born in Ivhala, but I've decided to move here. I don't;
T:miss that place. Pfff... my parents stills worship Agharias. You know,;
T:that legendary titan who apparently created the whole dwarven race?;
T:So we, a race of short peoples, would have been created by a giant?;
T:Ridiculous! I don't believe in that Agharias crap. Actually, I don't;
T:believe in the Creator either, but at least peoples here aren't acting;
T:like religious fanatics. They won't call you a blasphemer or anything;
T:if you don't believe in their god!;

T:And I guess I like living in a big city like Jindar. Lots of taverns,;
T:lots of adventuring jobs, lots of peoples to trade life stories...;
T:Jindar is really awesome, I tell ya! Well, you can do that in Ivhala too,;
T:but it's all humans and dwarves... Here, you have everything: humans,;
T:elves, half-elves, dwarves, gnomes, kobolds, devlings... everything!;
T:Much more fun than my relatives and their stone giant, heh heh heh...;

I:Randar Rockbeard;
T:Yeah, though I've only started working as a smith a few months ago.;
T:I've been adventuring in Portralis for years, and after seeing a lot;
T:of the world, I felt it was time for me to settle down, and live a;
T:less adventurous life. Don't get me wrong, I still take a lot of;
T:adventuring jobs. Just less than I used to. Plus, I like crafting;
T:weapons. I even invented a new kind of axe: the Pyrotechnic Axe!;

T:Yeah, that's how I called it. A red-colored axe that causes deep burns;
T:to whatever it strikes, in addition to causing a blaze to all enemies;
T:around the wielder! I haven't done any Pyrotechnic Axes for the shops;
T:though, it could be dangerous if it fell in the wrong hands.;

T:Hmmm... well, why not? You look trustworthy enough. I have two versions;
T:of the axe. The Pyrotechnic Battle Axe, or the two-handed and more powerful;
T:Pyrotechnic Great Axe. The battle axe will cost you 5000 golds.;
T:The great axe will cost you 10000 golds. Which one do you want?;

T:Oh, so you're investigating that case, huh? Aye, I did visit him. He was;
T:looking for mercenaries to hire, so I answered the call. A first, he told;
T:me about three assassins, which he described as an half-elf, a gnome and;
T:a Rhyzendalian. He didn't know anything else though, not even a clue where;
T:we should start searching. So I called two of my friends, a rogue and a;
T:sorceress, and we searched for the three assassins but found nothing.;

I:Randar Rockbeard;
T:So I returned to Mr. Harrington's mansion to see if he found out anything;
T:new. And then, something really freaky happened: he completely forgot;
T:about me! I told him my name, but that didn't work, he just said that;
T:he was waiting for a mercenary to come visit him. I tried to refresh;
T:his memory by describing the assassins, but that just made things worse!;
T:He said I was wrong and that the assassins were, get this: a cloaked;
T:assassin, a witch and a dwarf! That's me and my two friends!! And he didn't;
T:seem to be surprised to see me at all, he just said that I looked like;
T:one of the assassins, but I can't be him, because his guards killed him.;
A:Actually, the same thing happened to me as well!:0:0:0:1:16:0:0:0:0

T:a mansion and all! Pah! Money is nothing in this world when you got power!;
T:Who cares if he's rich? Both you and I are better warriors than he is!;
T:Oooh, guards are coming my way? Hmph! Bring'em on!;

I:Randar Rockbeard;
T:Yeah, you're probably right. *sigh*...To tell you the truth, I've given;
T:up that case. I'm a warrior and a smith, not some kind of detective.;
T:You might want to speak with my friends though. You know, the rogue;
T:and the sorceress? They live in this district nearby. Their names are;
T:Tom and Adrianna. Adrianna lives right behind the alchemy shop, while;
T:Tom's house is in the southeast of the district. Go speak with them, tell;
T:them Randar sent you and they'll answer your questions. Perhaps they'll;
T:know more than I do. Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful.;

T:Hmph, so you've won that second round. Well, you know the drill. I will twist;
T:reality to heal myself, and then teleport away. I won't always be able to do;
T:this though, so when we meet again, it will be our final battle.;
T:Until then...good bye!;

T:So, <NAME>, what do you think of the 'Defender Wights'? Pretty useful;

T:As I've told you before, I follow the words of Summapal. The world;
T:we live in is rotten. Weak. Useless. It needs to be changed.;
T:But no one will change it. So our order's goal is to alter reality,;
T:rewrite history! What if the orcs had won the war? What if peoples turned;
T:to archfiends rather than gods? Maybe this world would change for the;
T:better!;

T:Well, it's time for a rematch, <NAME>. Oh, you may have noticed these;
T:Chaos Elemental Lords, right? They are members of our order, who I have;
T:called here. Better yet, I have a spell to summon them whenever I need;
T:their services. I didn't use it last time, but this time, how about;
T:I show it to you?;

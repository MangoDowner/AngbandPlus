T:Ah, welcome <NAME>. The <RACE> who joined us. I'm still a little surprised;
T:that a <RACE> would want to help us. After all, it's supposed to be a guild;
T:of kobolds, and we're at war with the devlings. By working for us, you're;
T:making yourself an enemy of the devlings. But seeing that you've been;
T:promoted in rank, I guess the devlings aren't a problem for you.;

T:My name is Belgim, and I am the smith here. I craft the special items;
T:we Vipers uses. Starting from common equipment you can buy at any good;
T:shops, we enhance the items with our spells and technology.;
T:The result? We have some really powerful and unique items that aren't;
T:available anywhere else, not even in Karingen! And best of all? It's;
T:completely FREE for any members of the Stealthy Vipers!...well, provided;
T:you have the rank for it, that is. The higher the rank, the more stuff;
T:you can get. It's as simple as that.;

T:The Viper Crossbow is a fine piece of craftsmanship, if I do say so myself.;
T:In terms of technology, it's an enhanced light crossbow that even lighter,;
T:yet is much more powerful. But the real strength of the Viper Crossbow;
T:lies in it's special power. Once you activate it's magical ability, it will;
T:turn the bolt you shoot into a bolt of magical poison! So if an enemy you;
T:are facing is difficult to harm with a normal physical attack, activate;
T:the crossbow, and try an attack of pure poison. It might work better!;
T:The crossbow is the first of our unique items, available to Agent-Rank
T:members and higher.;

T:The Viper Boots are green leather boots, but they protect as much as;
T:Steel Boots, thanks to their unique design. They will protect you against;
T:poison, will enhance your speed, agility and make you more stealthy.;
T:Finally they will also improve your melee combat aptitudes. Not bad for;
T:a pair of boots, huh? They're available to all the Stalker-Rank members and;
T:higher. Imagine if you were to enchant them with a scroll! They would;
T:be really powerful!;

T:The Viper Cloak is a dark green cloak that not only provides good;
T:protection for a cloak, but it will also enhance your dexterity and;
T:make you stealthier. We also enchanted it so that it will enhance your;
T:accuracy with swords and crossbows. This makes it great when combined;
T:with our Viper Crossbows!;

T:The Viper Mail is the best armor in the world, no kidding! Not even;
T:the best Ivhalian Dwarven Smith could make something like that! In;
T:appearence, it's a greenish suit of chain mail, made from fine mithril.;
T:That's already good, but it carries a powerful enchantment that makes;
T:it extremely light. Combined with mithril's already light weight, this makes;
T:the mail so light that it can be considered a light armor rather than heavy;
T:armor. Add to that the fact that it improves your dexterity, stealth, agility,;
T:and ability to fight with swords and crossbows, and you have the very best;
T:of our craft. However, only the rare Wraith-rank members can have it.;
T:We only have the materials to craft a few...;

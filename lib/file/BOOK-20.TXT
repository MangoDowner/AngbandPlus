        Welcome to Portalis! This city is one of the biggest in the whole
world! For the weak there is a lot to see and for the strongs, a formidable
challenge await them! Here's a preview of what you can see in Portalis:

Shops: Most importants shops are in the middle of the city. Visit them all
and get some good stuff!

City hall: In the middle of the city, the castle-like building with water.
If you're looking for a job, go see the mayor! He might have something for
you.

Temples and services: Lot of different services are present in our city,
such as improving weapons, identify possessions, restoraion and so on.
You will find different services in all the city. To west and to south is
where you will find most of the different services.

Altars: We respect the great and powerful gods. We built an altar for each
gods that exist in this world. If you want to pray or to serve a god, why
don't you go to some of our altars?

        If you go to the northeast, you will find a long stairway down. This
lead to the dungeon of angband. DO NOT GO THERE unless you REALLY want to
die! A place reserved to the strongs!

        Also, south of here is a forest, The Grand Forest. Watch out! There
are some monsters in it! The trees are so big that it is impossible to fly.

Well, enjoy this city!

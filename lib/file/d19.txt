T:Sometimes, a strange, dark cloaked man comes here... He calls;
T:himself 'Jordan Shade'. Apparently he is some kind of agent working;
T:for the Black Market... could the Black Market have a shop around;
T:here, near the town? I never dared to approach this man though...;
T:He's the kind of man who could backstab you at anytime...;

T:Rumors says that beneath the northwest ruins is a huge labyrinth full;
T:of treasures! However, adventurers who went there found nothing but;
T:old ruins... and walking corpses. If you want my opinion, this place;
T:is nothing more than a haunted temple... and the treasures rumor only;
T:serve to attract careless adventurers there, so the undeads can devour;
T:them!;

T:Things does not bode well for the followers of Dalunia. The once supreme;
T:elven deity is now nothing but a minor goddess worshipped by a cult;
T:that keeps getting smaller and smaller. Now, most elven priests;
T:worship Daldumaar, the legendary founder of the forest kingdom of;
T:Nimbraya. From what I know, Daldumaar was a demigod born from an elf mother;
T:and a divine father. He founded Nimbraya, played a major in the orcish;
T:wars, and defeated Dumos Arikyenzal, the legendary destroyer of Nimbraya.;

T:As Nimbraya is growing in power, their religion is also spreading across;
T:Portralis. We meet more and more Daldumaarian priests and priestesses.;
T:Even the worshippers of the Allmighty Creator have started losing faithfuls;
T:to the Daldumaarians! Right now, it is the second most powerful religious;
T:organization in Portralis, right after the priests of The Creator. It seems;
T:like Dalunia will be completely forgotten before long...;

T:But fortunately, here, we all worship Dalunia. You should pay a visit;
T:to our priestess, Evolia. Please, support us! Dalunia is the goddess of;
T:nature, and a protector of the land and the living. And if you have true;
T:faith in nature, life and purity... you too will become a follower of;
T:Dalunia!;

T:Let me guess: he sent you to look for his sword? If I were you, I would;
T:not lose my time with this guy. He claims that he is a great warrior;
T:just because he killed a few little creatures. Moreover, he thinks he;
T:is the one protecting Fidac from evil! Don't be fooled, this guy is;
T:worthless. If you want to meet our REAL protector, go see Evolia the;
T:priestess. Don't waste your time with the gnome.;

Rogues are not bad people.  We use cunning, fighting and magic to complete
our purpose.  A good rogue is one who is not seen until it's too late, and
is able to spot the marks of a trap or a secret door just by walking past
it.  Magical devices and spells will aid you when times become difficult,
and combined with your other skills will make you a very difficult opponent
to defeat.  Becoming a rogue will increase your strength, intelligence,
dexterity and constition, as well as providing you with an array of skills.

ABOUT NIGHTMARE ABILITIES:

These abilities are a separate set of abilities that you can learn by defeating
Nightmare Horrors, and using their licialhyds. They do not require ability
points to learn, although they do count toward the total abilities limit.
Each Nightmare Horror has a different ability. You may learn a new ability, or
improve a learned one, once every 3 levels. Both normal races and monsters
may learn these abilities.

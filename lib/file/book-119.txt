Dear Elorel,

Your plan is working perfectly. I can't believe peoples are actually
falling for all the junk we sell them! The other day, that young mage came here,
he wanted to purchase a magic wand. I sold him one of our special
'Wands of Light Bolts'. To think that's he's gonna go dungeon crawling with it!
I'm sure undeads will be terrified by this most "powerful" wand!

"Crystal" balls are also selling well, and so are the statuettes of
Daldumaar. 100 golds for a statuette? Thanks to your magic, it doesn't
cost a single coin to produce them! We're completely robbing peoples, but
they're too stupid to notice it.

Well, that's not true. The other day, an unhappy customer came back. She
was a young apprentice mage, and she said her new crystal ball was fake,
and it was just glass. The next day, I've heard a rumor at the
Dragon's Head inn that a young apprentice had been murdered. The assassin
I hired did a good job!

So far, I've accumulated 15000 golds this week, just by selling our
junk. Please send me a new shipment as soon as possible. I'll be in need
of it!

T:Normally, I would say that the slums are dangerous, but right now,;
T:they're quite safe compared to the horrors around the temple!!;
T:I'm glad I'm not stuck fighting those green-skinned monsters!;

T:This is the northeastern slums of Jindar. This a place of vermins and;
T:thieves of all sorts. But more importantly, all the important devling;
T:guilds are here. And they are at war with the kobolds from the southwestern;
T:slums. So as you can probably guess, this is not a safe place for;
T:citizens. You should leave.;
A:Don't worry. I can hold my own in a fight.:0:0:0:1:3:0:0:0:0
A:Why don't you send guards to restore order in the slums?:0:0:0:1:4:0:0:0:0

T:...it's not that easy. Some of the rogues there are more than simple;
T:thugs. They are actually capable fighters, and they can use all sort of;
T:dirty tricks to fight us. We do our best to arrest them, but sometimes,;
T:they give us as much trouble as we give them. This is really bad...;
A:I see. Good bye.:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

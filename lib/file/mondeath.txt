# This is the file for allowing dying uniques to speak their "own" lines.
# Deleting this file will have no real effect on the game.  Modifying it may
# cause STRANGE unique lines to come up if the format's wrong, but shouldn't
# crash anything.  The format goes like so:
# 
# N:45:whoever this is
# 3
# says line 1
# says line 2
# says line 3
#
# The number after the N: is the "monster index number" obtained from
# r_info.txt.  The text field after that number isn't actually used--it's
# just there to help humans edit the file.  The numbers on lines by
# themselves are the number of lines that the monster has.  Getting these
# numbers wrong won't crash anything, but will produce strange lines.
#
# A '*' in the number field is a wildcard and applies to any monster.
# It should only be placed at the end of the file, since all 'N:' lines
# after it will be ignored.
#
# Two or more monsters can share lines; just put their N: lines in a
# contiguous block.
#
# To stop a certain monster from having unique lines, put a # in front of
# its N: line.

says, 'My creator will lay my soul to rest.'
asks, 'Was that worth dying for?'
asks, 'Can you say you are proud of what you've done?'
says, 'But there are some things which cannot be excused.'
says, 'Why is it some of us are here just so that we'll die?'
says, 'The shortest straw, pulled for me.'
says, 'There's got to be just more to it that this or tell me why do we exist?'
says, 'I can't believe that really my time has come.'

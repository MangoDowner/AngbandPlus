I:Rugar;
T:A long time ago, this land was a kingdom. It was long before the five;
T:great kingdoms existed. I served as king Zailab's highest general, and;
T:I led the king's army to many victories in battle. But one day, a;
T:strange disease started killing the peoples of our kingdom. Many of my;
T:soldiers were afflicted, and few survived this terrible illness.;
T:The king called upon his priest, Jezovhan, to bless the kingdom's river,;
T:in the hope that sick peoples would gather near it, drink the water,;
T:and get cured.;

I:Rugar;
T:But it turned out that the one responsible for spreading the disease;
T:was the priest himself! He laughed, and claimed that he already blessed;
T:the river with the "Light of Vaharoh", the god of treachery and corruption.;
T:Fueled by anger, I challenged the priest to a duel, but I was no match;
T:for his great powers. He killed me, but instead of letting me rest in peace,;
T:he revived me as a cursed skeleton knight! I do not know what happened;
T:to my king afterwards...but he probably turned the king into an undead;
T:monster as well.;
A:He was turned into a Lich, which I defeated...[tell him the story]:1:46:1:1:7:0:0:89:1

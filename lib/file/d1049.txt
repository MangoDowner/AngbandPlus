T:Not much, except rumors of voices and strange noises in the temple's;

I:James Harris;
T:Oh yes, so you're here for the contract. Very well, I will explain;
T:what this is all about. I'm not a wealthy man you see. I have this;
T:house, and some family heritage, but that's about it. At least;
T:I HAD family heritage, but it has been stolen! As I was drinking a cup;
T:of tea, a small group of devlings entered into my house, and started;
T:stealing every valuable possessions they could find, including;
T:my late mother's silverware! These devlings threatened to kill me;
T:if I screamed for help, so I remained silent, helplessly watching;
T:them rob me of all my valuable goods!;

I:James Harris;
T:Before leaving, they told me that they were members of the Dragon Lancers,;
T:and that no one can stop them. When I spoke to the guards about this,;
T:they said that the Dragon Lancers had apparently disbanded after one of;
T:their representatives had been found dead. They said it was probably;
T:the work of some of the southwest kobold guilds, and that they prefer;
T:to say out of this conflict. Pfft...what a bunch of cowards...;

T:So anyway, I've finally found out about your guild, so I sent a request for;
T:help, along with some golds. They sent me a reply, saying they accepted;
T:the offer, and one of their agents would visit me soon. Guess that agent;
T:is you, <NAME>. What I need is for you to find the silverware they stole;
T:from me. I don't care about the gold, it has probably been spent anyway.;
T:But I would really appreciate if you could bring me back the heritage;
T:my mother gave me.;

I:James Harris;
T:Let me think....hmmm...the graveyard perhaps? I have heard rumors about;
T:noises and voices being heard in the graveyard. Who knows? Perhaps they;
T:have a secret hideout there or something. Perhaps searching the graves,;
T:or even doing some gravedigging could reveal their hiding place. In any;
T:cases, please find my heritage as soon as possible. It's about the only;
T:thing I have that's really precious to me, and I don't want to lose it.;
T:Good luck, <NAME>!;

T:You can return to your guild, and tell them you've fulfilled the contract;
T:I paid for. Though I'm sure you'll get rewarded, here's a little bonus;
T:for you. It's not much, but it's the least I can do to say thanks you.;
T:I wish you good luck in your future contracts, <NAME>!;

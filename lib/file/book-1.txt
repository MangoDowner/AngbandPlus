A BASIC GUIDE TO CRAFTING
-------------------------

Tired of always being at the mercy of shopkeepers and their ridiculous
prices when it comes to buying weapons and armors? Can't find the
axe you're looking for in the dungeon you're exploring? Well, how'bout
making your OWN axe? Or whatever weapon or armor you wish to get?

Crafting is easy actually. You need two components, and then you forge
them together, and you will create a new piece of equipment! Of course,
this requires some skill, so not anybody can do that. But once you know
how, you'll never want to buy a weapon again!

First, the basic components. Here's a list of components you need to
create your first weapon, and what you can make with the component:

Mace handle: Needed to create a Mace.
Chain: Needed to forge a Flail.
Walking Stick: Turn that into a Quarterstaff!
Spear Shaft: Needed for Spears.
Halberd Shaft: Needed for Halberds.
Small Axe Handle: Well, you could make an Hand Axe. But that would be
                  an insult to the best kind of weapon! But at least it's
                  better than the useless short sword...
Short Axe Handle: Short, but bigger than the small one. Needed for a
                  battle axe. The best one-handed weapons!
Long Axe Handle: Ah, my favorite! Makes some sweet Great Axes! The
                 perfect weapon! The best! The greatest!!
Brass Knuckles: Needed for any knuckles...but I prefer to use gauntlets.
Pike Shaft: Needed for Pikes.
Knife Hilt: Useless component to create a useless weapon. Seriously...
            how could one specialize in DAGGERS??
Short Sword Hilt: Needed for Short Swords. I don't see any use to this crap.
                  Slower than a dagger, weaker than the ever popular long sword.
                  Don't use this. Use a battle axe instead.
Long Sword Hilt: Yawn... Long Swords... everybody has a long sword. Aren't
                 you just tired of that Long Sword craze? Use an axe instead!
Claymore Hilt: Needed for Claymores.
Warhammer Handle: Needed to make warhammers.
Rapier Hilt: Needed to make rapiers. I just don't understand rapiers. They're
             not even sharp! Piercing sword? Bah! Use a pike instead! Forget
             about those rapiers.
Katana Hilt: Needed to make katanas.
Scimitar Hilt: Needed to make scimitars. You know... the differences between
               this and the long sword are minimal at best. Why don't you try
               one of these instead of that same, old, boring long sword?

Once you've found your component you need an ore of metal. Any metals will do!
Of course, some are betters than others. Bronze is useless, but steel makes
some nice weapons. But bronze is easy for beginners though... Once you've
got both the component and the ore, just craft your weapon!

Now, for armors! It's a little different. Most of the armors are made from a
previous type of armor, and then adding even more metal! But first, you will
need some Leather hide, along with a Clothes pattern. Combining these two
will result in a basic Leather Armor. With the Leather Armor, you can do
two things:

Combine with another clothes pattern to get a Reinforced Leather Armor.
Turn it into a basic mail if you get an ore to combine it with.
Combine it with more leather to make the Heavy Leather Armor.

If you get a heavy leather armor, you can combine it with metal to create
a very nice suit of Plate Mail. Now, this is rather difficult to accomplish,
but it's a damn good armor, I tell you! And if you're a master at crafting,
you can even combine that Plate Mail with more metal of the same kind,
and get a Full Plate armor! This is the best type of armor, but you won't
be able to make this unless you're very good at crafting.

Well, hope my little guide has been helpful. Of course, there's more to this,
and there's most likely many components I didn't mention. Just experiment
a bit.

And remember! Axes are better than swords!

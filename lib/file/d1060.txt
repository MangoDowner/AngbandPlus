I:Namira;
T:Oh, <NAME>, thanks you for visiting me. I apologize once again for all;
T:the trouble I've caused you. I promised I would give you a reward, so;
T:let me give you these magical gauntlets. Unlike most gauntlets, these;
T:will not hinder your spellcasting abilities. In fact, they will greatly;
T:improve it. A useful spell has been imbued in them too, so I'm sure;
T:you will find them most useful.;

I:Namira;
T:I worked on these gauntlets for many years, using some of the Archfiend's;
T:knowledge to create the enchantment. But don't worry, no evil powers;
T:have been placed in them. Wear them proudly, <NAME>!;
A:Thanks you, Namira. [END DIALOG]:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

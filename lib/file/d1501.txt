T:Ivhala's the best and greatest kingdom in Portralis! Much better than;
T:those forest dwelling Nimbrayans if you ask me. Here, we have a powerful;
T:army, mountains offering natural protection, weapons and armors of;
T:dwarven steel. We just cannot be defeated!;

T:Are you a skilled monster slayer? Or perhaps you're skilled in crafting?;
T:If you have either or both, then you'll find plenty of stuff everywhere.;
T:If not...well, I suggest you go to Jindar instead, because you won't find;
T:much work here.;

I:Dwarven Defender;
T:Beware the Cockatrices. There are quite a few in the Agharias mountains, and;
T:their petrifying breath keeps taking away the life of many explorers.;
T:If you do any mountain exploring, I'd advise taking some equipment to;
T:protect yourself against earth elemental attacks, or you may fall prey;
T:to these beasts.;

I:Dwarven Defender;
T:We Defenders are masters of the shield! We learn to be one with our shield,;
T:and it becomes both a weapon and an armor for us. That said, there are many;
T:alternatives to wielding a shield. Skilled swordsmen and spearmen uses;
T:their respective weapons to block incoming attacks, and I have heard;
T:rumors that some powerful Nimbrayan Monks can block using their bare hands;
T:and arms! But no matter what you choose, remember that you need dexterity;
T:and reflexes to block accurately, so it may be a good idea to train;
T:your reflexes a bit if you want to be a master of blocking.;

I:Dwarven Defender;
T:I have heard rumors about a dwarven smith in Jindar who crafts some unique;
T:axes enchanted with fire magic. I don't understand why he's wasting his time;
T:in Jindar when he could make a fortune here. But if you want to look for;
T:him next time you visit Jindar, I've heard he lives near a weapon shop.;
T:But you'll probably find everything you need here.;

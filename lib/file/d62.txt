T:need anything, but try to harm him and you'll have to answer to my axe!;

I:Savius Bodyguard;
T:He's a gnome scientist who came all the way here from Karingen. He's well;
T:versed in orcish history, and he's been investigating these ruins for years;
T:now. Of course, these ruins can be dangerous, so he hired us to protect;
T:his hide. To be honest, it can be a little boring at times when he's busy;
T:in his studies and we just stand around doing guard duty. But he pays us;
T:nicely, so I won't complain.;
A:The ruins are dangerous?:0:0:0:1:3:0:0:0:0
A:Good bye.:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

T:The cave south of here is nothing we can't handle, and I'm pretty sure;
T:you can handle it as well. But there are other places around here that;
T:even we won't approach. And I suggest you do the same. A few bodyguards;
T:ain't enough for those places, we'd need hundreds like us! Went there;
T:once. Heard a dragon's roar. Never went back.;

I:Savius Bodyguard;
T:Hmmm... now that I think about it, at one time, I did find what looked like;
T:a huge lake of lave, and there was something that looked like a cave in the;
T:middle of it. I didn't go there, but it was straight south of Ivhala.;
T:So I guess you could go to Ivhala, and go straight south, and you'll;
T:eventually find it. Not sure if that's what you're looking for, but that's;
T:all I know. Sorry.;

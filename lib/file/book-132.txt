I hear them coming for me... I have no strength left, and nothing to cure
myself, so I'm going to die very soon. But first, I must write an important
message to anyone who came here to save us.

When we arrived in the Lancers HQ, hoping to find more about this
high-ranked member, we found no devlings, only the animated remains of our
brothers and sisters, as well as some other undead monsters. Our poison
attacks were ineffective against them, so we fought them with our weapons
alone.

It was difficult, but we managed to make it to the main hall. It's then
that we encountered "it". A terribly powerful undead monster like none
we've ever seen. A black, sword-wielding skeleton, we could feel
pure evil and darkness emanating from it's bones. It moved quickly
toward our team, and started attacking us.

We tried to hit it, it didn't even flinch. None of our attacks harmed
it. It, however, decimated our team in no time. I'm the only one who
survived, and I ran away. But there was more remaining undeads, and I
couldn't escape to the surface. I fled in this corner, hoping I could
at least have some time to write a warning note. So to anyone who reads 
this: flee. Do not proceed to the main hall, just leave this place.
You are no match for this monster.

T:We are a mercenary guild of Kobolds. We name ourselves the Stealthy Vipers;
T:because as you know, we Kobolds master the arts of stealth and poison!;
T:But don't be fooled by the name. We are capable of much more than just;
T:covert operations. We are excellent warriors and wizards too! We can do;
T:just about any jobs!;

T:Well...not too much. We get some stuff in the slums around here, but we;
T:would certainly like to expand! But unfortunately, this is not possible;
T:at the moment. And it will never be as long as our rivals, the;
T:Dragon Lancers, exists! Damned devlings... If only our leaders would;
T:organize a big assault on these bastards...;

T:The Dragon Lancers are a mercenary guild of Devlings, a bit like ours.;
T:Because of them, we cannot expand beyond the southwest slums. Doing so;
T:would cause a big, open war to erupt for control of the city. And I;
T:doubt Julian's army would tolerate that. So right now, we're stuck;
T:here, in the southwest slums. Hopefully our leaders will find a way;
T:to kill those devlings once and for all!;
A:Maybe I can help?:0:0:0:1:5:0:0:0:0

T:Ah, but of course! We can always use an extra kobold in our ranks!;
T:If you're interested, speak with Krind, the representative. He will;
T:allow you to join us, and believe me, you'll have plenty of jobs!;
T:Trust me. There's plenty of devlings to kill, and lots of gold to be;
T:made! You'll like this!;

T:we could use you. After all, any enemies of the devlings are a friend;

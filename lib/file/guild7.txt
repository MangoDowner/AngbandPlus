Druids are the protectors of the earth, powerful in their might, powerful in
their magic.  If a druid desires something, that will become his.  Becoming
a druid will increase all of your abilities, and grant you the special ability
to transfer your own energy to various other forms to aid you.

When you become a druid, you will be given, completely free of charge, the
first elemental magic book, a quarterstaff, a robe and either a shield or
protective boots.  The power of the earth is always there.  Use it.

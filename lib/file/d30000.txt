T:Greetings, <NAME>. It seems like you have died, and your soul;
T:has now been freed from your body. Normally, the souls of the dead;
T:are reclaimed by their gods, demonic patrons or any other entities they;
T:were bound to. In the event that you would be associated with;
T:no such being, you become a lost soul, who will wander the world until;
T:you can finally rest in peace.;

T:However, your case is unique, in that you have arrived here. This is the;
T:Limbo, a place between life and afterlife. Only a few select souls arrive;
T:here. Nevertheless, you are now in control of your fate. From here, you;
T:can choose to return to the world of the living, and even do so in a;
T:new body. Or, you may choose to end your existance and rest in peace;
T:forever...;

T:If you wish to return to the world of the living as you were before;
T:you died, go through this portal. Note that each of your deaths are;
T:recorded, and going through this portal will increase your death count.;
T:Each deaths lowers your score, so if you die a lot, your score will be;
T:much lower. Also, you will lose all gold and all objects that you were;
T:carrying in your backpack, as well as your equipment, that had a value;
T:higher than 1000 golds. However, items marked as 'eternal' will not;
T:disappear.;

T:You may choose to go through this portal to return to the world of the;
T:living, with all your stats and skills reset to zero, and without any;
T:abilities. You will be granted an amount of stats, skill and ability;
T:points based on your level. In other words, you will be able to start;
T:over your character. However, note that in addition to the standard;
T:penalities of resurrection, reincarnations will also be counted and will;
T:greatly lower your score. You should never give up on a chosen path.;
T:Instead, you should find creative ways to overcome obstacles. But if you;
T:really want to reincarnate, step through the Portal of Reincarnation.;

T:If you are satisfied with your accomplishments, or no longer want to play;
T:with your character, then step through the Portal of Final Death. Be aware;
T:that once you do that, your death is permanent and you will no longer;
T:be able to play with this character. You will then be awarded a score;
T:based on the enemies you have defeated and the number of times you've died.;
T:If you are tired of your character, this option is worth considering over;
T:reincarnation, as it will give you a much higher score, and thus something you;
T:can be proud of, rather than a low score and a character sheet tarnished;
T:with a Reincarnation count.;

I:Lost Soul;
T:Your score is based on the total number of enemies you've defeated.;
T:Each specie of enemies you defeat grants you 10 points. You will get;
T:20 points if you've defeated an elite version, and 30 if you've;
T:defeated a boss version. It's important to note that this is based;
T:on the number of species, and not the total number of each species;
T:you've slain. For example, defeating a Fire Hound and a Cold Hound;
T:will award you 20 points, but defeating two Fire Hounds will only;
T:be worth 10. Unique enemies are worth 50 points and I believe there;
T:are even some particularly mean enemies that are worth over 100 points!;

I:Lost Soul;
T:Each deaths will lower your score by 10%. This not additive, so;
T:10 deaths does not equal 0 points. The first death lowers your score by 10%.;
T:That new score is then lowered by 10% for the second death. And so on. So if;
T:you have 1000 points, and two deaths, the score will be 810. After that,;
T:the score is further lowered by 33% for every reincarnations. This can greatly;
T:affect your score. If you have 1000 points, 1 death and 1 reincarnation, your;
T:score will be 600. If you have two deaths and two reincarnations, your score;
T:is down to 360. So if you are tired of playing a character, consider final;
T:death over reincarnation, as it will give you a better score.;

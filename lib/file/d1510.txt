T:So you came, <NAME>. I expected you would find your way down here.;
T:Curious about this door? You opened it, yet it's still closed. Doesn't;
T:make much sense, right? But then, it wouldn't be chaos if it did make;

T:You turn around, and see a full plate clad man, who's hairs and eyes;
T:are a bright orange, an unnatural color. You can sense similar powers;

T:Hmph... Looking at you, I wonder how you managed to defeat him. You are;
T:a zulgor too, yet you are clueless in the face of reality twisting. The fact;
T:that you cannot understand this door's nature proves that you are weak,;
T:and unworthy of our race! Our order has no place for a weakling like you!;

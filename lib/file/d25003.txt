T:*pant*...*pant*...congratulations, <CLASS>. You have defeated me.;
T:You have earned my greatest respect. I have been trapped in this place;
T:for ages... This is a place that is between the material plane and the;
T:plane of spirits. A prison that kept me prisoner ever since the fall;
T:of my race. The purple energy you saw was a mind controlling spell;
T:casted by none other than Arikyenzal himself!;

T:I don't have much time left...there is something you must know.;
T:Daldumaar... the elves in Nimbraya worships him as a champion who fought;
T:the mighty Destroyer Arikyenzal, and saved Nimbraya. But the real story;
T:is very different. Daldumaar was actually a SERVANT of Arikyenzal!!;

T:the mightiest warriors in Portralis...but at the same time, you have;
T:learned a very important piece of information that could greatly shake;
T:the kingdom of Nimbraya. Right now, you may leave this place. But if;

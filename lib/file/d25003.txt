T:Dorgal is known for his great strength, and his mastery of Fire and Wind;
T:magic. But because of the evil magic that was used on him, both aspects;
T:of him have materialized into powerful beings of their own. The great;
T:elemental Pyrex the Burner of Souls, and the giant Avemir, an orcish;
T:word for "second in strength", econd to the Avemorsh. The force that seals;
T:the door is tied to these two powerful beings, and as long as they exists,;
T:the seal cannot be broken.;

T:But over the ages, both Pyrex and Avemir became fully independant, and their;
T:power has grown to the point of being almost equal to Dorgal. Because of this,;

T:Pyrex the Burner of Souls is a cruel, yet extremely intelligent and powerful;
T:elemental of Fire and Wind, though his mastery of Fire is far greater than;
T:his Wind. After all, Fire has always been associated with rage and violence,;
T:two things that describes him very well. He is responsible for controlling;
T:and corrupting the mind of the Divine Guards that were once living in peace;

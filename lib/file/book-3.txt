POISONOUS POTIONS
-----------------

Written by an anonymous person...

I like alchemy for one thing: poisons. Toxic potions, mixing
unhealthy mushrooms to taint fresh water... Who am I?
None of your business...but if you're interested in my
findings, read further!

POTION OF POISON
Component type: Alchemy
Skills required: Alchemy(1)
How to create: Potion Of Water + Mushroom Of Poison

This potion will cause pain and aches to anyone who drink
it. Poor it into someone's glass of water or wine, and see
the result! Or throw it in the face of your enemies, and
have some fun!

POTION OF BOOZE
Component type: Alchemy
Skills required: Alchemy(0)
How to create: Potion Of Water + Mushroom Of Confusion

The wonderful potion of booze if a funny thing indeed! I
once used it on a serious scholar, and guess what? He
started to dance, tell jokes and do tons of gross stuff
in his confusion! Have fun with this one! Oh, and did
I mention you can also throw it for some interesting
effects?


Heh heh, hope you have some fun...but maybe you need some ideas
as to what to do with your poison? Heh heh, here's an idea,
my favorite weapon!

POISON DAGGER
Component type: Crafting
Skills required: Crafting(2), Alchemy(2)
How to create: Dagger + Potion Of Poison

Well, it's a dagger coated in poison. What's more lovable than
that anyway? Easy to hide, and attack quickly with a venomous
sting! Kinda make you snake-like, heh?


Okay, so you accidentaly poisoned yourself, and now you want an
antidote. Fear not! Just use the blessed water on the mushrooms!

MUSHROOM OF CURE POISON
Component type: Alchemy
Skills required: Alchemy(5)
How to create: Mushroom Of Poison + Drops Of Blessed Water

An antidote mushroom. Of course, I don't have a use for it, as
I never poison myself, but for neophyte...it could be useful.

MUSHROOM OF CURE CONFUSION
Component type: Alchemy
Skills required: Alchemy(5)
How to create: Mushroom Of Confusion + Drops Of Blessed Water

(sigh)...I just found out that there is a way to stop the
confusing fun of the mushroom of confusion and the potion
of booze. Oh, boy do I hate that blessed water!!

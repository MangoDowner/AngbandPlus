        regeneration rate.

              +1% to regeneration rate for every 3 points.

If you were to die from any sources, there will be a roll between this
ability's power and (dungeon level * 3). If you win the roll, you will
survive, with 0 hp. Also, this ability will increase your hp's
regeneration rate if you place many points in it. The increase is applied
before any other bonus, so if you have other abilities that increases
regeneration, you may end up with a very powerful regeneration rate.

ABOUT NIGHTMARE ABILITIES:

These abilities are a separate set of abilities that you can learn by defeating
Nightmare Horrors, and using their licialhyds. They do not require ability
points to learn, although they do count toward the total abilities limit.
Each Nightmare Horror has a different ability. You may learn a new ability, or
improve a learned one, once every 3 levels. Both normal races and monsters
may learn these abilities.

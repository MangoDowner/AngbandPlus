# File: randart.txt

# This file is used to generate randart descriptions, in a way similar
# to player history.

# Note that the "spacing" in the "description" lines is very important!

# Phrasing is partially taken from ToME

# General format: Beginning (item "visual" description) -> Background
#  (item "history") -> Abilities (some of item's properties)
# Note that this file is actually parsed only "on demand", and does
#  not generate .raw file, like other edit files do. While the
#  format is generally the same as other edit files, sections of this
#  file are delimited by "%".

# THIS FILE IS VERY INCOMPLETE NOW. For consistency, even    #
# most of the completed entries are COMMENTED OUT. I would   #
# greatly appreciate if someone writes *GOOD* descriptions   #
# for the randarts. My own English is far too poor.          #
# (Well, maybe not poor, but certainly not artistic enough!) #

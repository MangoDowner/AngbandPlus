T:for my help, saying they were attacked by a ghost, and could not defend;
T:themselves against it. Being a priest, it is my task to fight and repulse;
T:the undead, so I went outside, and used my telepathic powers to locate the;
T:ghost. It was not too far from the shrine, so I ran there, and confronted;
T:the unholy creature.;

T:enchanted weapons. In any cases, I was able to defeat the ghost, so I;
T:returned to the shrine. The leader, who introduced himself as Delvan The;

T:Delvan and his men must have stolen my relic! In fact, Delvan is probably;
T:the one who summoned the ghost in order to trick me! I can't understand why;
T:they would steal it though. It's a precious Amulet of Golden Truth. When;
T:you become a priest of Shan, one of such amulets is given to you.;

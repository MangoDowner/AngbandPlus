Well well, it's nice to speak to you again! Do you recognise me? It's your
"good friend" from the temple's graveyard!

How do I know you're reading this? Well, who else would dare to defy an
Unholy Champion? No Stealthy Vipers possess the skills and strength
required to fight such a powerful creature. Took me a while to learn
how to summon them, but they are so much more powerful than anything
living! So much evil and darkness in them... and that black poison they
radiate... and they fight with incredible skill and power!

But anyway, you might be wondering what I did with the agents Krind
sent to our headquarters. Well, you already killed them! They were
amongst the undead vipers you fought. And what about the other Lancers
you ask? Well, if the Stealthy Vipers attacks our base, I'm sure we
can do the same, right? hehehehehe...

You might want to bring this little note to Krind, and let him know
that the Lancers are preparing an attack on the main headquarters
of the Vipers. Hehehehe, we'll crush you like the little flies you
are! At least your deaths won't be in vain. You know what I'll do
with the bodies of the fallen!

Well, see you later! Hope we will meet very soon!

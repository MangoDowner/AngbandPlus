T:Greetings, <NAME>. My name is Korthrax, and I have received words that;
T:you were looking into obtaining an Amulet of Golden Truth. Normally, such;
T:requests would be turned down immediately, as you are not a follower of the;
T:Golden Sul-Rin. But Shan directly asked us to accept this request. I do not;
T:know why you are an exception to the rule, but I am in no position to;
T:question Shan's orders.;

T:But do not think that you will be given an amulet for free. Though you have;
T:proved to be quite a force in combat by defeating a cult of Ryoon, that isn't;
T:enough to earn an amulet of Golden Truth. The real test is about to begin.;
T:And I shall explain it to you right away.;

T:Though you have defeated a cult of Ryoon, the Archfiend's influence in the;
T:region hasn't been stopped yet. In fact, all you've killed is a minor;
T:group of fanatics. In order to earn your amulet, you will have to put;
T:a permanent end to Ryoon's followers in the Agharias region, and in order;
T:to do that, you'll have to kill their most powerful priest. The man I am;
T:refering to is a traitorous Rhyzendalian named Loroth Varos, who betrayed;
T:Shan and turned to Ryoon. This traitor must be punished, and it is your task;
T:to put an end to his existance.;

T:those 'Demon Wights', one of Ryoon's signature servants.;

T:The Grey Wight is one of Ryoon's most powerful servants. The Grey Wight;
T:itself would be unstoppable, short of an intervention from the gods;
T:or other Archfiends. But what you are facing is only an avatar, so there;
T:is still hope. Forget about Ivhala though. It is the end for them. The avatar;
T:has more than enough power to completely destroy it by itself. And it will;
T:be made even easier with help of that chaos order.;

I:Korthrax;
T:The amulet of Golden Truth wouldn't help you against the Grey Wight.;
T:It is grey because it has absorbed all the champions of light it has;
T:defeated. Many celestials and heavenly beings who attacked Ryoon tried;
T:to fight the Grey Wight, and failed. The monster absorbed them, and;
T:because there were so many, it has become resistant to light, the force;
T:that once had a chance to harm it. This has created a monster that;
T:neither light nor darkness can fight.;

T:Not that I know of. It is both a demonic and undead being that is impervious;
T:to light. This means it has all the strengths of both, but none of the;
T:usual weaknesses. The best you can do is fight it with all you've got, and;
T:hope for the best. It is clear that no mere mortal can defeat it,;

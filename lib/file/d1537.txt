T:Incredible! To defeat an avatar of the Grey Wight is no small feat.;
T:That confirms it. You are not a mortal, at least not anymore. There's;
T:no way a mere mortal could have done all what you did!;

T:Of course! But as I've told you before, this is going to be our last fight.;
T:Our powers may seem limitless, but that's not the case. After restoring;
T:myself many times, I will need to rest for a bit, for this power is very;
T:demanding. At least it is for the moment. If Summapal's plan come true,;
T:however, our powers will become unlimited!;

T:His name is Dhazen Summapal. He is the first of the children of chaos that;
T:were born from the red licialhyd. You probably heard that story before,;
T:right? He is therefore the oldest and most powerful zulgor in Portralis.;
T:He is also the only true pure-blooded zulgor left in this world.;

T:Neither me nor you are pure-blooded zulgors. My bloodline is more pure;
T:than yours, but I am still impure. Summapal wants to restore our bloodline,;
T:to purify us. Both you and I could become far more powerful than we are.;
T:We would ascend to a different level of existance. And then, we could;
T:reshape this worthless world. We could rewrite history. Doesn't that;
T:appeal to you?;

If god be willing, the most holy of people will be granted the skills of a priest
and those of a warrior.  Becoming a holy warrior will give you those skills
necessary to defeat the most evil of enemies, but you will not be granted any
skills that you will not require.  Your faith will be tested at every step, and
if your will is strong enough you will succeed.

If you are accepted into our church, you will be granted the use of a holy prayer
book, a weapon from our collection, a scroll you can read to protect you from
evil and a bonus item of divine choice.  May god be with you.

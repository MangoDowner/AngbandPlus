T:Shortly after I sent you to Avemorsh, Quazar came and killed me...;
T:and then, he tricked you. Due to my devotion to prayers and meditation,;
T:however, I have been able to remain in this world in the form of;
T:a ghost. As a ghost, I have been able to follow Quazar, and learn;
T:of his plans... It will not last long, however, so I will explain to you;
T:what's going on... and then, I will depart.;

T:The red licialhyd is a stone that contains the power of Chaos, the;
T:most unstable and normally unreliable type of magic. However, Quazar;
T:is a zulgor. He may looks like a normal man, albeit one with an odd;
T:color of hairs and eyes, but part of his body is made of pure chaos...;
T:...a bit like you, <NAME>. You are a zulgor yourself, made of pure;
T:chaos. However, he is very different from you...;

I:Ghost of Navarius;
T:As a zulgor, he is unbelievably strong physically, and has great control;
T:over the normally unpredictable force of chaos. However, this zulgor;
T:has mastery of chaos far beyond that of a normal zulgor. Using chaos, he;
T:is able to alter reality. He can make it so that things that exists;
T:do not exist anymore. He can change the shape of things. He can even;
T:bring into existance things that simply cannot exists. He has the;
T:power to make possible what would normally be impossible, and thus;
T:defy the laws of physics and reality...;
A:But...does that mean that the orcs...:0:0:0:1:5:0:0:0:0

I:Ghost of Navarius;
T:Indeed, <NAME>. The orcs do not really exist. They are not demons;
T:coming from the planes of Hell. They are actually an aberration of;
T:reality. Something that should not be. And so is Quazar's temple.;
T:As you can see, he changed the shape and appearance of the temple,;
T:but once inside, everything is still as it was before. That is;
T:because he altered the exterior, but not the interior.;

I:Ghost of Navarius;
T:But as if the power to change reality was not enough, Quazar wanted;
T:even more power. He knew about the red licialhyd, a stone containing;
T:chaos so powerful that normally, anyone who would activate the stone;
T:would instantly die. Quazar could not defeat the Knight of Balance,;
T:as the knight was completely immune to the magic of chaos. But seeing;
T:your potential, he tricked you into defeating the Knight, and then;
T:took my appearance to take the licialhyd from you.;

T:Now, he has done the impossible: merge with the red licialhyd. Now,;
T:there is virtually no limits to what he can acheive with that much;
T:power. His body and the stone now makes one extremely powerful entity.;
T:I do not believe anyone in Jindar has enough power to destroy him;

T:stone is something that we've never seen before! However... I also;

T:able to survive a brutal and unexpected siege, explore deep caves;
T:full of dangers, and even defeat the powerful Knight of Balance...;
T:If anyone can accomplish something like defeating Quazar, that;
T:would be you.;

T:from the exterior. Be warned that you will be inside a fortress of;
T:chaos, and the layout, even the nature of the place, might be very;
T:special. He magically sealed the doors of his temple, but with the last;
T:of my powers, I will sacrifice my ghostly body in order to unseal the;
T:doors, and allow you to enter!;

T:Make sure you are ready though. You should go to a temple store, or;
T:an alchemical store, and buy a variety of curative potions. He will;
T:be able to alter your mind and body with his chaos in ways that;
T:would be too harsh to describe, so you have to be ready. Obtain;
T:powerful magic relics, especially ones that would allow you to resist;
T:the forces of chaos. He will most likely use that against you.;

T:the most powerful member. I cannot imagine what a power greater than;

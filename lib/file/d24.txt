I:Zailab;
T:Thanks you, brave <CLASS>. By destroying my cursed body, you have freed;
T:my soul, and I will finally rest in peace. You see, ages ago,; 
T:I was a king, and these ruins were my castle. I was loved by my; 
T:peoples, and I lived a very good life... But one day, a mysterious man;
T:came into my castle. He looked like a priest, judging by his glowing; 
T:white robes. Thinking he was serving the light, I allowed him within; 
T:the walls of my castle. He introduced himself as Jezovhan, priest of light,; 
T:and was willing to put his powers at my disposal.;

I:Zailab;
T:At first, he acted like any priests would do. He was a trusted healer;
T:and adviser... But one day, my peoples became sick. A strange sickness;
T:that turned their skins pale, and made them act strangely. It did not;
T:take long before my entire kingdom got afflicted with the disease.;
T:I summoned Jezovhan to my throne room, and asked him to put a blessing;
T:on the river, to that peoples could drink the water and be healed.;
T:But then, he said: "But my king, I already blessed the river! As we;
T:speak, all these villagers are now drinking the water that I blessed...;
T:with the light of Vaharoh!!";

I:Zailab;
T:It turned out that the priest was a worshipper of Vaharoh, the god of;
T:treachery and corruption! All this time, the priest acted like a good;
T:priest of light, but he was really an evil priest of Vaharoh! Before;
T:I could say anything, the priest continued: "And you too, shall be;
T:blessed by Vaharoh's light!". And then, he casted his foul curse!;
T:The peoples that were infected by the sickness died, and became;
T:mindless, walking corpses. Being a wizard, I tried to fight the priest,;
T:but my magic was not strong enough... and he killed me.;

T:And then, the priest used his magic to curse my soul, and revive me;
T:as an insane, evil lich! And then, he left the castle... leaving behind;
T:a population of walking corpses. My kingdom was destroyed, and in my;
T:madness, I used my dark powers to summon more undead creatures, and;
T:create this dark labyrinth of undeath to be used as my new castle.;

I:Zailab;
T:... but at least, now, I can rest in peace, thanks to you. The destruction;
T:of my cursed body will bring an end to the curse that plagued these ruins.;
T:Remember this, my friend: do not be fooled by the light. There is good;
T:within the darkness, and evil within the light. I do not know if Jezovhan;
T:is still alive or not... but be careful. Do not fall in the same trap as;
T:I did. Do not let the priests of Vaharoh fool you with their light and;
T:their lies!;

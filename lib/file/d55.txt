I:Cleo;
T:An experiment, basically. You see, the REAL story is that Ophelia;
T:was the assassin, and the healer with curative powers was Maelan!;
T:That's right. He was no mean-looking warrior, he was a priest!;
T:Ophelia was an evil assassin who carried misfortune. She was not;
T:content with simply killing her victims. She enjoyed condemning them;
T:to eternal suffering!;

I:Cleo;
T:After the murder, she coerced historians and book writers into writing;
T:a deformed version of the real story, where Maelan would be the bad;
T:guy, and she would be the good healer. Therefore, she would be remembered;
T:as an heroine, while he would be remembered as an evil man.;
T:And her plan worked! What she didn't know, however, is that the misfortune;
T:she carried would spread over the false books. And over the years, they;
T:became cursed books, containing a fake history. These cursed books allowed;
T:me to travel to this plane. And for my own amusement, I've decided to;
T:create an alternate world where the false story would become reality!;
A:So this house with Ophelia and Maelan was your creation.:0:0:0:1:4:0:0:0:0

I:Cleo;
T:Exactly. And I wanted to enjoy seeing you killing Maelan, as the books;
T:suggested. But it seems you saw through my game, somehow. Or maybe it;
T:was just luck? Anyway, you have won. You have discovered the truth,;
T:and you were able to find me. Congratulations!;
A:So...now what?:0:0:0:1:5:0:0:117:1

T:Now what? Well, I'll go some place else I guess. As long as the books;
T:exists, I'll be able to stay in this world for as long as I want!;
T:So, good bye, <NAME>! Hope you've enjoyed playing with me!;

T:She disappears in the shadows. It seems like the whole story of;
T:Ophelia was fake, and she was actually an evil assassin. You should;
T:return to the town, and inform mayor Jeffrey of your discovery.;

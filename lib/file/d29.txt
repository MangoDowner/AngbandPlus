T:I... I remember now... I was a monk in Nimbraya...;
T:I was so proud because I had developped a secret technique... But because;
T:it was so powerful, I became greedy... I never wanted to show my;
T:technique to anyone. I never wanted to teach it, let alone use it at all...;
T:In the end... I never used it again, and I forgot it. Greed tainted my;
T:wisdom, and I had lost the mastery of my technique. I could no longer;
T:use it.;

T:the home of the mighty Orc Warlord, Avemorsh. And after years of;
T:research and investigation, I can confirm, without a doubt, that this was;
T:the case. This was the hometown of history's most powerful mortal warrior!;

T:savages, who cared about little more than crushing the skulls of humans,;
T:dwarves and elves. And fighting amongst themselves in times of peace.;
T:However, I have evidences that this wasn't the case at all! While they did;
T:have a warrior culture, they were noble, and embraced values such as honor;
T:and courage. They were also just as intelligent as gnomes and humans, and;
T:they had powerful magics and combat techniques. They were very powerful,;
T:but tolerant of other, weaker races, such as humans back then. They never;
T:attacked other races without reason.;

T:for your trouble!;

I:Professor Savius;
T:This is a lot of gold, but you've risked your life, going down very;
T:dangerous dungeons and even facing a dragon! I couldn't have done it;
T:myself. Even with my bodyguards, they would never have been able to;
T:survive through that much danger. It's amazing the powerful creatures;
T:you can encounter in this world... But you've managed to survive through;
T:all of this! Who knows, maybe you too have some dormant, demigod powers;
T:inside you, like Dorgal! Hahaha!;
A:That would explain everything!:0:0:0:1:38:0:0:0:0
A:I just did what I had to do.:0:0:0:1:38:0:0:0:0

I:Professor Savius;
T:Anyway, I'll probably stay here for a while, just to finish up a few;
T:things, but I'll return to Karingen after that. At long last... it's been;
T:so long since I've been there... Well, I wish you safe travels,;
T:<NAME>! And if I ever need the help of a ressourceful <manwoman> again,;
T:I know who to look for!;
A:Is there anything else I can help you with?:0:0:0:1:39:0:0:0:0
A:Good bye.:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

I:Professor Savius;
T:Not right now, I believe you've done everything I needed help with.;
T:You're free to continue your adventures. Feel free to explore the tomb;
T:to the south if you haven't already done so, though it should be;
T:easy for you, the creatures there are much weaker than those in the;
T:Agharias mountains!;
A:Anything of interest in there?:0:0:0:1:40:0:0:0:0

I:Professor Savius;
T:For you? Not much. I mean, it wasn't even challenging for us! The only;
T:challenge we ever faced was one door we couldn't open. But we ended up;
T:finding another way to get to the tomb at the bottom of the cave.;
A:A door?:0:0:0:1:41:0:0:0:0

I:Professor Savius;
T:Yes. At one point, on the last floor of the cave before reaching the tomb,;
T:we came across what seemed to be a sealed passage to the stairway.;
T:There was no way to unlock the door, and we failed to bash it down.;
T:It was some huge stone doors... not sure what it was. But we ended up finding;
T:the stairway elsewhere, and we were able to find the tomb, so I guess it;
T:was nothing important. Still, feel free to search for that sealed door if you;
T:wish. Maybe you'll be able to unlock it somehow.;
A:Good bye.:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

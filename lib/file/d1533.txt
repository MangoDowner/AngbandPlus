T:You enter the queen's training underground. She is there. However,;
T:much like Emma, her skin is pale, and she has an empty, soulless gaze.;
T:It seems she too has been turned into an undead being by the Grey Wight.;

T:The Grey Wight came here. I drew all the power from my amulet of Golden Truth,;
T:and tried to fight him. I've failed. But now, I understand why. Shan is;
T:weak. She is a weak demoness, unlike Ryoon, who is a real, powerful;
T:Archfiend. So I threw away the amulet, and accepted Ryoon's blessing.;
T:I am no longer part of the living. And if I prove myself worthy, I will;
T:become a ghost, and become a member of the Grey Wight's elite force.;
T:How is that, <NAME>?;

T:A shame, <NAME>... because now, I will have no choice but to kill you.;
T:But once you're dead, maybe you too can be raised as a ghost, and serve;
T:the Ghostfather. Yes. I will kill you, so that you too can enjoy undeath!;

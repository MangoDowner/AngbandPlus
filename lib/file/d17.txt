I:Letter;
T:<NAME>! If you read this letter, this means you are alive, and I;
T:am glad! Thanks you for everything you've done... but it seems;
T:the enemy's plan was much too big for us to counter. I've failed;
T:to protect Udor... I never thought that we would suffer such a;
T:brutal invasion... especially an invasion of orcs. We never took;
T:orc sightings seriously... Perhaps if we would have paid a little;
T:more attention to Clara's words... perhaps none of this would have;
T:happened...;

I:Letter;
T:But now, as I write this, the orcs are destroying the town... Not;
T:even you can fight them now, and you should flee to the north, to;
T:the city of Jindar. You won't be able to stop the orcs alone. You;
T:must go to the city of Jindar, and let king Julian know about the;
T:invasion. Commanding the largest and most powerful army in the world,;
T:he alone can stop the orcs.;

T:and may the gods be with you!;
T:Oh, and one last thing... I have included a scroll of Teleportation.;
T:It should help you escape this city. The monsters are too powerful;
T:outside, but with this scroll, you should be able to get out quickly.;

T:The letter ends here. A small map has been drawn on the back of the letter.;
T:It shows the location of Jindar at (48,41). You can hear the sound of battle;
T:outside. It seems they are in great number, and you won't be able to fight;
T:them. It looks like you have no choice but to go outside, use the scroll,;
T:and flee to the north...;

T:Well, you're almost there! Only one more room to go. See the wall in front;
T:of you? Behind it is the stairway that will lead you to my chamber.;
T:But of course, you need to find the switch to open. Are you ready for your;
T:last challenge? See if you can reach the switch, without suffering your;
T:final destruction! Mwhahahaha!;

Cursed Evasion(Passive)

Effect: Gives you another roll to dodge melee and ranged attacks.
Power: 2% of normal dodge roll per Misfortune points.
Extra points: +2% of normal dodge roll per Misfortune points.
              With 3 or more points, also apply to Magic Defense rolls for the
              purpose of avoiding spells.

Gives you a second roll for dodging melee and ranged attacks. It is equal to
a certain percentage of your normal dodge roll, depending on how many points
you place in the ability, and your Misfortune level. It takes the TOTAL dodge
roll, meaning that any passive ability or any other bonus you normally have
will be applied to this ability, and so with a few points, it will greatly
improve your ability to dodge attacks.

Should you place 3 points in this ability, the ability will apply to magic
defense rolls for avoiding spells. It then uses that roll instead of the
melee/ranged dodge roll, but otherwise works the same way.

ABOUT NIGHTMARE ABILITIES:

These abilities are a separate set of abilities that you can learn by defeating
Nightmare Horrors, and using their licialhyds. They do not require ability
points to learn, although they do count toward the total abilities limit.
Each Nightmare Horror has a different ability. You may learn a new ability, or
improve a learned one, once every 3 levels. Both normal races and monsters
may learn these abilities.

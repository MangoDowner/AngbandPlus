I:Slums Kobold;
T:There are the southwest and northeast slums. Here, you're in Kobold;
T:territory. To the northeast, it's the Devlings. So you're in the;
T:good place here! We the Kobolds are good guys. Not like those dumb;
T:Devlings to the north. If only there were not so many guards around;
T:here! We could easily kill them all!;

I:Slums Kobold;
T:They are filthy, worthless creatures, they... but then, you're not;
T:a kobold. You cannot understand. We're both a race of small peoples,;
T:we live in the same places, we share many similar ways of life...;
T:So it's only natural that we are rivals and enemies. Yes, some says;
T:that we could be friends. But there's more to this conflict than;
T:you can understand. The devlings did things to us, and they will;
T:pay for it! But that doesn't concern you... better for you not to;
T:get involved in this. The Stealthy Vipers will get rid of the for;
T:us anyway.;

I:Slums Kobold;
T:Well said, my friend! Hmmm...you look quite a powerful <CLASS>. Want to;
T:help in the fight against devlings? In that case, I suggest you go;
T:to the southeastern parts of the slums here. You'll find a building;
T:guarded by kobolds. This is the Kobold guild of the Stealthy Vipers.;
T:A group of kobold mercenaries, or at least they're trying to be. But they;
T:can't have their guild until the devlings disappear. You should speak;
T:with the representative there. He will fill you in.;

I:Slums Kobold;
T:I've heard stories from the dungeon kobolds about some spirits known;
T:as Xythanos... Their ethereal nature allow them to pass trough walls,;
T:and they are impervious to normal weapons. Furthermore, they attack;
T:with ethereal, planar blades that not only causes terrible wounds, but;
T:can teleport you far away! Finally, they are extremely fast and extremely;
T:powerful. If you ever meet one, you should definitly run away!;

T:Have you heard the rumors about the Blood Queen? I've heard she's some;
T:sort of thieves queen or something. Nobody knows where she hides though.;
T:The guards are completely clueless! If only they had more of our kind;
T:in their ranks... we do stealthy stuff much better than humans!;

T:Yeah! A guild of kobold mercenaries! They are the best mercenary guild;
T:in all Jindar! No, in all Portralis I'd say! If you need a job done,;
T:go see them. It's to the souht-east part of the slums. Always guarded;
T:by two viper mercenaries. You can't miss it.;

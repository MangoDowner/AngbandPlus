T:There are the southwest and northeast slums. Here, you're in Kobold;
T:territory. To the northeast, it's the Devlings. So you're in the;
T:good place here! We the Kobolds are good guys. Not like those dumb;
T:Devlings to the north. If only there were not so many guards around;
T:here! We could easily kill them all!;

T:They are filthy, worthless creatures, they... but then, you're not;
T:a kobold. You cannot understand. We're both a race of small peoples,;
T:we live in the same places, we share many similar ways of life...;
T:So it's only natural that we are rivals and enemies. Yes, some says;
T:that we could be friends. But there's more to this conflict than;
T:you can understand. The devlings did things to us, and they will;
T:pay for it! But that doesn't concern you... better for you not to;
T:get involved in this.;

T:Surprised? Do you really think I'm just an ordinary thief? Heh heh heh...; 
T:but to tell you the truth, I'm not really behind all that. I merely gave;
T:orders to the orcs and goblins. I'm not the one who brought them back;
T:to life! It's funny though... ages ago, we kobolds used to be the slaves;
T:of the orcs. Now I'm the one who orders them around. Funny, huh?;

T:Soon, human, dwarves, elves and all other races will unite once again;
T:to fight against the orcs... and once again, the world will be at war,;

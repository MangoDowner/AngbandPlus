T:<NAME>! Glad to see you! As you can see, the Dragon Lancers have invaded;
T:our headquarters! Krind told us to come here, and help you out, so we came.;
T:We must kill those Lancers, and rescue Nidem!;

T:We're not sure. We know that some fellow Vipers are still inside, fighting;
T:the Devlings. But we haven't heard anything about Nidem. We've learned that;
T:Denzar, the leader of the Dragon Lancers, came here in person. It's possible;
T:the the two leaders may be fighting each others. We must hurry, and help;
T:out Nidem! We must not let Denzar kill him!;

T:We haven't heard anything about him, nor have we encountered any undead;

T:on our guards. He could appear at any moment!;

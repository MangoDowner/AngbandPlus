T:About 500 years ago, there was a young woman name Ophelia. She was born;
T:in this very town. She wasn't an ordinary however. She was born with the;
T:natural ability to foresee the future, to make accurate predictions.;
T:Furthermore, she had the natural ability to heal peoples of their wounds;
T:and diseases. Due to this natural talent, some peoples thought she wasn't;
T:really a human, but a divine envoy, a celestial being. Her ability was;
T:soon put to good use, and she saved the life of many peoples. She was;
T:also passionate with nature, and would often comment on how beautiful;

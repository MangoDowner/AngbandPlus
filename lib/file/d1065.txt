I:Denzar;
T:...you...must be <NAME>. You must listen to me. Delviaz...;
T:is a traitor. He used the feud between our guilds to collect dead bodies,;
T:and practice necromancy. And now, he tricked me into leading an all out;
T:assault against the Vipers. Your guild was more organised than ours, and so;
T:we have lost the battle. But the casualties were heavy on both sides, and;
T:that is exactly what Delviaz wanted.;

I:Denzar;
T:As you've probably seen, he has turned all the slain Kobolds and Devlings;
T:into undead creatures. I do not know what his plans are, but it is now;
T:clear to me that he never really cared about the Dragon Lancers, and he;
T:had his own plans all along. Please, <NAME>... You must defeat him!;
T:I know it's strange for a former enemy to ask something like this, but;
T:right now, both the Stealthy Vipers and the remaining Dragon Lancers;
T:will be destroyed if you let Delviaz accomplish his goals! This isn't;
T:just about Kobolds and Devlings anymore... it's about saving Jindar;
T:from a very dangerous and very powerful necromancer!;

T:Denzar closes his eyes, and the remaining necromantic energy in his undead;
T:body is gone. He is now dead. Although this means that the Stealthy Vipers;
T:have won the battle against the Dragon Lancers, the victory may be;
T:short-lived if you do not defeat Delviaz.;

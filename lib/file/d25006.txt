T:stands a giant fire elemental, with glowing red eyes. It's mere presence is;
T:enough to fill the room with a heat so intense that an entire city could be;
T:set afire merely by this creature's presence. Yet, somehow, you are able;

T:Ah, there you are! Hope my servants didn't cause you too much trouble.;
T:It's an honor to meet you, <NAME>. You now stand before;
T:Pyrex, the Burner of Souls! I was once an elemental of fire and wind, but;
T:as my anger and destructive desires grew, the fire became my favorite;
T:aspect, and the one I've been empowering the most. I am proud to say;
T:that my flames rival, or perhaps even surpass those of my creator,;
T:Avemorsh Gin'Whal. This gives me absolute authority around here, and my;
T:only equal is the giant Avemir... and the true master of this place, who;
T:shall remain nameless.;

T:able to come here, somehow. Tell me... how does it feel to stand before;
T:a powerful being like myself? I am far above the common elementals that lives;
T:in your world. I am above the Divine Guards, and certainly on par with some;
T:higher rank Divine Champions!;

T:Am I? But mortals do nothing but pray to gods and other greater beings!;
T:They always put faith in someone else's hands! Whenever there's trouble,;
T:they call upon the gods to aid them. Some more wicked mortals will ask;
T:the Archfiends instead. They might ask a dragon. Some powerful spirit.;
T:Anything like that. But they never do anything by themselves! I think;
T:mortals are weak, because I have yet to see one of them rise significantly;
T:above the others. But who knows? Maybe you are that one <heroheroine>!;

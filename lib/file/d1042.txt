T:The what? Oh, you must mean that junk we stole from that demon worshipper.;
T:Haha, what a naive fool! Dragon Lancers? Haha! We're not Dragon Lancers,;
T:we're the Delvan Gang! Well, it was disappointing though.;
T:This thing doesn't even have any powers! That's just a worthless piece;
T:of metal! But still, I can't just let you have it back, as it would be;
T:against my principles. I never give back what I steal, no matter how;
T:worthless it is! If you want it back, you'll have to take it from my dead;
T:body! All right boys, let's give <himher> a good trashing!;

T:one that worship a supposed Archfiend...;

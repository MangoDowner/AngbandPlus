T:Who am I? Let's just say that I'm a high ranked member of the Dragon Lancers.;
T:As you've probably noticed, all the monsters you faced here were really;
T:the animated remains of your fallen Vipers brothers and sisters.;
T:And I am using this ghost to speak to you, but this is not my real body.;
T:I just think it's fun to play with the bodies and souls of fallen kobolds!;
T:Hahahahaha!;

I:Dragon Lancer Member;
T:Patience, <NAME>. You are still a mere Agent-rank member, and therefore,;
T:a minor nuisance to us, the Dragon Lancers. However, for some reasons,;
T:I think there is more to you than what meets the eyes. We have observed;
T:you, and so far, you've been quite successful in accomplishing;
T:the tasks assigned to you, including killing one of our representatives.;
T:Not only that, but you have accomplished them all alone!;
T:Now THAT is unusual. I was wondering why they didn't send you an escort;
T:or anything, so I wanted to test your strength, and see what you were;
T:capable of. And I am quite happy with the results! I guess Krind must;
T:have seen your potential the minute you joined!;

I:Dragon Lancer Member;
T:Well anyway, I look forward seeing more of your successes. Perhaps we'll;
T:even fight one day! Now, as for that contract you came here to fulfill,;
T:I'm going to be nice, and tell you where we hid that guy's treasure.;
T:You'll find it at the bottom of a small cave northwest of Jindar,;
T:at (45,37) on your map. Go take it, so you can fulfill your contract.;
T:The main reason we stole it was to attract you here, so that I could;
T:observe just how much of a threat you really are.;

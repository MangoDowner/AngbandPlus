I:Nilgam;
T:About me? Well, I was actually born in a cave, along with 10 brothers;
T:and sisters. We were raised as fighters, but unfortunately, I was;
T:never able to acquire the skills necessary to wield a sword properly.;
T:Lack of dexterity and skill, and then I had a body weaker than average.;
T:I was considered a weakling amongst my kind. I was the family's black;
T:sheep, and in wild kobold tribes, such individuals are often killed;
T:by their own families, as there is no places for weaklings.;

I:Nilgam;
T:So in order to avoid persecution, I fled the caves, and came to live;
T:here in Jindar. I had to live in the slums for a while, until I came;
T:across a kobold wizard by the name of Gurgam. An educated wizard, far;
T:from being the stereotypical filthy, aggressive cave kobold, he took;
T:me under his protection, and raised me as his son and apprentice.;
T:He taught me how to read and write, and eventually how to use magic.;
T:And thus, I became a wizard.;

T:A couple of years later, Gurgam told me he entered a mercenary guild;
T:known as the Stealthy Vipers, and offered me to join him in his cause,;
T:and put my magic powers to the service of our kind. And so, I accepted.;
T:This is how I became a member of the Stealthy Vipers. Today, Gurgam;
T:is one of the highest ranked members of the Stealthy Vipers.;
T:Who knows, if you continue to do good work, maybe you'll get to meet him!;

T:This also means that the supposed dwarf assassin might not have been;

T:help. The cloaked man and the witch must have been peoples the;

T:shops in the city, and see if you can't find his home. Once you've found;

I:Eloriel;
T:Why? Because it's extremely profitable. Humans aren't the wisest of races,;
T:you see. They are easily fooled. My business aims to exploit this flaw;
T:of the human race. With my powers, I shape objects from nothing but earth,;
T:and I put lowly enchantments on them. And then Donoriel convinces peoples;
T:that the items are worth buying. To the humans, we elves are a race of wise;
T:peoples, and they would never expect us to be thieves. That reputation made;
T:things much easier for us.;

T:We made a great amount of profits already from the lowly stuff I've created.;
T:But now, our secret has been discovered, and I'm afraid I can't let you get;
T:away with this. There's too much money at stakes, and we don't want to lose;
T:it. Time to put an end to your life!;

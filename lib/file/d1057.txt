I:Tom;
T:Me? A Rogue?? ...hehehe...yeah, I guess you could say that. I do like;
T:entering forbidden places, 'borrowing' treasures from other, more;
T:fortunate peoples... But don't get me wrong, I would never steal from;
T:the poor! My targets are all rich snobs from the Mansions District!;
T:Most of them inherited all their wealth, they didn't even earn it!;
T:So it's my job to make sure they are kept 'busy', hehehe...;

I:Tom;
T:Harrington? Oh yeah, that weird snob from the Mandions District! Yeah,;
T:me, Randar and Adrianna went there. I assume Randar already told you;
T:what happened there, right?;
A:Yes. And the same thing happened to me.:0:0:0:1:6:0:0:0:0

T:Good. So you know there's something wrong going on in the Harrington;

I:Tom;
T:Hmmm, so I've picked your curiosity, heh? But me being the professional;
T:that I am, I do not share my information for free. If you wish to know;
T:more, you'll have to pay me 2000 golds first. After all, Harrington;
T:promised a reward, and if I am to help you get it, then I want a part;
T:of it. How does that sounds?;
A:All right, here's the gold. [Pay 2000 golds.]:0:0:0:8:2000:8:9:0:0

I:Tom;
T:Thanks you, <NAME>. All right, I'll tell you what I've found. As you've;
T:probably guessed, the mansion is full of treasures! Lots of expensive;
T:furniture, and apparently a valuable family heirloom hidden somewhere;
T:in a treasure room guarded by an elite warrior Harrington hired.;
T:But that's not the only thing hidden in the mansion. There's;
T:also a secret basement!;

T:Err, did you hear me correctly? I said 2000 golds. Seems like you don't;
T:have enough. I like you and all, but I don't give discounts to anyone.;
T:Come back when you have the money, and then I'll talk.;

I:Tom;
T:Behind the mansion is a secret stairway. The switch is hidden at the;
T:very bottom-left corner of the mansion, right in a pool of water.;
T:You may have to search carefully in order to find it. It will open the;
T:stairway, and then you can enter that basement. So I went there, looking;
T:for treasures...and then I met some kind of imps. You know, those little;
T:flying and annoying demonic creatures? However, they weren't ordinary;
T:imps. I tried to fight them, but I couldn't, and I had to flee. I don't;
T:know what kind of monsters they are, but I'm not returning there anytime;
T:soon! Demons don't just appear like that, so I'm sure they are related;
T:to the events of the Harrington Mansion.;

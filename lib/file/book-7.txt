Some text is written on this old scroll, along with a drawing:

#1##2##3#

#4##5##6#


Starting in front of a number that represents the great kingdoms, move
three grids to the left. When you get in front of a new number, take
that number, and substract from it an amount equal to half the number
of letters in the name of the one who betrayed my king Zailab. Finally,
answer this question: Who is the supreme being whom the betrayer
claimed to serve?

1. Ryoon, the Ghostfather.
2. The god of treachery and corruption.
3. Dalunia, Goddess of nature.
4. An evil priest.
5. He served no one but himself.

Once you've made your choice, increase your number by the answer's number.

Now, choose a door, and face your fate.

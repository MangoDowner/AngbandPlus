T:I don't know. Something about Jindar I believe. From what I hear, it seems;
T:that relations between Ivhala and Jindar have been deteriorating lately.;
T:Well, can't say I like them too much, with them thinking they're the most;
T:powerful country and all... The largest? Maybe. But large doesn't mean;
T:powerful. But in any cases, the queen's palace is closed to visitors at;
T:the moment, so you'll have to come back later.;

T:Ah, I see. Yes, I have heard that the relations between our two countries;
T:have been deteriorating lately, something about problems with merchants;
T:and annoying soldiers I believe. Still, as much as I'd like to let you in,;
T:I can't. The doors are locked from the other side, and cannot be opened;
T:from this side. You'd have to use...err, nevermind. I can't let;
T:you in. Sorry.;

I:Ivhalian Defender;
T:...somehow, I feel like you really have something important to discuss with;
T:the queen, so I'm gonna tell you a secret... Below the palace is an ancient;
T:labyrinth of tunnels, a place said to have been built long ago during the;
T:early days of Ivhala. There is a secret passage below the western barracks;
T:that leads to it, and the switch to open it is behind the eastern barracks;
T:main building. Be careful though, as it is guarded by a golem specially built;
T:to protect this secret route, and since you're not one of us, it'll likely;
T:attack you. After that, you'll just have to head through the east tunnels,;
T:and you'll find your way in the palace.;
A:Thanks for the information!:0:0:0:1:8:0:0:0:0

T:No problems, but don't tell anyone about this, all right? If the captain;
T:hears about this, I'll lose my job for sure. So just do what you've got;
T:to do, and forget about me!;

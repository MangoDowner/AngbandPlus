T:Glad to meet you, <NAME>. As I said, I'm a dragon armors specialist.;
T:If you've ever fought those beasts, you know how hard their scales;
T:are! It's only natural that one who defeats such a creature would want;
T:an armor made from the beast's scales. But just because you're a great;
T:warrior doesn't mean you're necessarely a great smith! And this is where;
T:I come in!;

T:Adventurers like you brings me the scales of the dragons and drakes.;
T:And I make armors from them, and charge a price that is more than;
T:reasonable. Of course, obtaining the scales may not be easy, but for;
T:experienced adventurers, I offer an alternative to paying exorbitant;
T:prices you'd normally pay for dragon armors! So tell me, <NAME>,;
T:what are you interested in?;

T:Me? Well, I was once a dragon hunter during my younger days. Me, a couple;
T:friends, and our master, often went on dragon hunting journeys. We would;
T:take the scales and sell them for profit. That was the good old days!;
T:But it all ended when my master died by the claws of an Ice Drake...he did;
T:not know that the Ice Drakes couldn't be really hurt by normal weapons,;
T:and neither did we. That day marked the end of our dragon hunting days,;
T:Now I work as a dragon armor specialist, and forge armors for the new;
T:generation of dragon hunters who brings me dragon or drake scales.;

I:Gary Dragonheart;
T:Dragons are amongst the strongest creatures in the world. Underneath;
T:their reptilian appearence lies a creature with great intelligence;
T:and magical powers, far above those an average mortal wizard would;
T:ever possess. Their elemental breath attacks are not mere natural;
T:defenses. They draw power directly from the dragon's inner magical;
T:energy. Their scales are extremely tough, and combined with the;
T:dragon's size, this makes dragons incredibly resilient. So as you;
T:can see, dragons are pretty much the perfect creatures. They have;
T:strength, size, toughness, intelligence and magical powers. And they;
T:don't have any real weaknesses to offset this.;

T:You have the six basic colors: red, white, blue, green, black and gold.;
T:Each of them possess a different type of elemental energy. Red has fire,;
T:white has cold, blue has electricity, green has poison, black has acid;
T:and gold has light. Then you have the Ice Dragons of Rhyzendal, which;
T:have ice scales that are indestructible to mundane weapons.;
T:Their elemental breaths combines cold with shards of ice for physical;
T:damages. And finally, you have the prismatic dragons, the most powerful;
T:known dragon kind, combining all six elements into one body,;
T:and recognisable by their purple scales and their superior powers.;

T:A dragon's powers will also greatly evolve based on how long it lives.;
T:But even baby dragons are capable of fighting, and can be found as predators;
T:in the upper levels of dungeons and caves. They continue to fight through;
T:their youth, becoming deadly and intelligent creatures. Once they reach;
T:maturity, they become unstoppable forces that can only be defeated by the;
T:bravest and most powerful challengers. Dragons loves to fight by the way.;
T:They enjoy testing their might against strong adventuers, and keep their;
T:belongings as war trophies. The older they live, the more treasures they;
T:accumulate, and some of the oldest dragons have incredibly large treasure;
T:hoards.;

T:Well... Several years ago, my master told me something. He said that while;
T:he was tracking a mature red dragon he was hired to kill, he briefly saw;
T:a copper-colored baby dragon! He tried to follow it, but lost it's track.;
T:Later that day, he saw an orange-colored baby dragon! Although the color;
T:was different, the baby dragon was otherwise identical to the copper;
T:one. Could it have been the same dragon? Unfortunately, my master never;
T:saw it again...and he got killed before he could ever get a chance to search;
T:for it.;
T:*sigh*;

T:*He shivers, as if you just mentionned something that makes him remember;
T:some unpleasent memories...*;
T:...drakes... Well, a drake's kind of like a smaller, lighter dragon, but they;
T:are just as dangerous as the larger dragons, if not more. To make up for;
T:their lesser raw power, they are faster, they can use their energy breaths;
T:more quickly, and even have the power to magically summon real dragons!;
T:A drake's magical abilities should never be underestimated... Also, they;
T:control two elements instead of one. My master told me about the;
T:Frostfire Drake, a drake of fire and cold, the Noxious Drake, a drake of;
T:acid and poison, and the Sky Drake, a drake of electricity and light.;

T:And of course, there's the notorious Ice Drake, perhaps the nastiest of;
T:them all. A drake of pure magical ice that is near impervious mundane weapons.;
T:Don't even bother trying to damage their scales, it doesn't work. My master;
T:learned that the hard way... and the damn thing killed him. And we were;
T:never able to avenge him. The Ice Drake is the first drake I've ever fought,;
T:and also the last one. We never killed it. *sigh*... Anyway, I hope you'll;

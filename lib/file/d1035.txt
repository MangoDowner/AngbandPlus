I:Slums Devling;
T:This is the northeast slums, and a Devling territory. Kobolds lives in;
T:the southwest slums, and as you may know, we don't exactly like each;
T:others. Filthy kobolds! Always toying with poisons and what not. We're;
T:not like that. We use polearms! We are quicker, and fight much more;
T:honorably! Well...at least the warriors do. I'm not much of a fighter...;

I:Slums Devling;
T:They are filthy, worthless creatures, they... but then, you're not;
T:a kobold. You cannot understand. We're both a race of small peoples,;
T:we live in the same places, we share many similar ways of life...;
T:So it's only natural that we are rivals and enemies. Yes, some says;
T:that we could be friends. But there's more to this conflict than;
T:you can understand. The devlings did things to us, and they will;
T:pay for it! But that doesn't concern you... better for you not to;
T:get involved in this.;

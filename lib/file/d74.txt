T:It didn't take long before I was able to defeat our leader in combat, as;
T:well as my own father. I became the youngest to ever be named Warlord.;
T:Once I became a grown-up adult, no one could best me in battle. I led my;
T:people to many victories, and fought many battles that would have been;
T:lost if I wouldn't have fought on the front line. I even fought against;
T:dragons, who were becoming more and more arrogant. Eventually, they started;
T:demanding tributes from other races. I would never accept to surrender to;
T:dragons, so I went in their own caves, and challenged them.;

T:their own, they started coming to me one by one. At one time, five dragons;
T:of the Prismatic kind, the most powerful kind of dragon, fought me;
T:five-on-one. And I was still able to defeat them. The few remaining dragons;
T:fled, and our lands were free from the draconic influence.;

T:five-on-one battle, I might not have won... But still, when you consider that;
T:very few warriors are capable of fighting even a single adult dragon alone,;
T:defeating five of them with relative ease was quite a feat. I understand;
T:you may not believe it, but it really did happen. I really had that kind;

T:whole "Demigod" thing. The Elf smirked, and said that I had no choice in the;

T:Some of my warriors became aggressive, and engaged in battle with the dwarves.;
T:Some orc women died while giving birth, and their children were sick and;
T:weak. Something was wrong, but I couldn't tell what it was. One of my shamans;
T:suggested the possibility of a curse, and that a demon might be behind it.;
T:So my warriors started hunting for demons or evil spirits. Of course,;
T:I already had a good idea of who was responsible for this curse... So I left;

T:people, and he said that he placed a curse on my people, and that the only;
T:to break it was for me to "awaken". Otherwise, it would drive my race insane,;

T:The Elf's magic was too powerful, and he said that it was the true power;
T:of an awakened demigod, and that as long as I didn't embrace my true nature;
T:and remained a mortal, I would never stand a chance against him. He then;
T:used some magical attack to knock me down. I was paralyzed, and couldn't;
T:move. Then, he started using some magic on me. He said that if I didn't want;
T:to awake by myself, he would force me to do so. He would force my true power;

T:felt... strong. Powerful. I've decided to return to the mountains. As the days;
T:passed, I've felt like my power was increasing days after days, but the more;
T:power I had, the more...tired, I felt. It's like if I was slowing moving on;
T:to another plane... disappearing from this world. I returned to my peoples.;
T:The curse was still strong. The Elf had lied to me. My awakening did not;
T:bring back any sanity to my race. I had been defeated. I was no longer worthy;

T:There was one last thing I wanted to do. I went down to a hidden room in;
T:one of the buildings, and used my magic to transfer some of my memories;

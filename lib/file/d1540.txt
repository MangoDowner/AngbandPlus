T:I hardly consider this a defeat, <NAME>. Even though you survived,;
T:thousands of Defenders have joined me in the world of undeath. They have;
T:been liberated from the curse of life. In addition, the soul of that;
T:lady Balcia will now belong to the Ghostfather, and she will surely;
T:be reincarnated in the form of a demonic ghostly being. She will be;
T:a valuable addition to Ryoon's forces!;

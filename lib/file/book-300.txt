I can't believe it! It really do exist! The Grey Wight of Ryoon, the
Ghostfather's most feared creation! The embodiement of fear itself! I can't
believe I'm facing this monster right now! I...I just can't fight it.
The fear...it's too strong. I can't move... I don't even have the courage
to run away. I was praised as a brave and fearless warrior, now I'm just
hiding like a coward, waiting for my death... I just can't do anything
anymore. The fear is too strong.

But before I die, to the one who finds this, let me tell you about the horror
that is the Grey Wight... The Grey Wight is a legendary monster, created by
none other than the Col-Nor Ryoon, known as the Ghostfather. It is not just
a simple, necromantic creature. It's the very embodiement of fear! In
appearence, the Grey Wight is a grey humanoid shape, but it has no facial
features, save for a creepy glowing red circle in the center of it's face,
which is the closest thing the creature has for an eye. But as it gazes you
with it, you will be in fear... No matter how fearless, no matter what
protection you have, fear will afflict you. Such is the will of the
Ghostfather. The monster possesses incredible strength, it's body is almost
impossible to harm. It can steal your soul. It moves with great speed...
and then it afflicts you with the curse.

Before I die, I will do one last thing... cast one last spell. By chance,
the ceiling around the creature's hideout isn't very tough, and perhaps
my Earthquake spell can cause it to crumble, and thus imprison the creature.
Though the Wight's deadly curse has afflicted me, by sealing the monster,
perhaps it will give a chance to future adventurers to flee before being
afflicted by the curse as well. I swear, do not free this monster!
Run... that's the only thing you can do. The curse of fear is impossible
to resist. Flee...flee while you can.

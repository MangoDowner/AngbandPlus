T:Well, it wasn't completely empty, there was a golem, but since you've;
T:already defeated it, the room is now really empty. You can now start;

T:However, as you look closer, you discover that the room isn't completely;
T:empty. There is a large, humanoid stone statue in this room. And when you;
T:approach, several runes that are etched on it's body starts to glow, and;
T:the statue begins to move. It seems like some kind of guardian golem,;
T:and you will most likely have to defeat it before you can investigate;
T:this room any further.;

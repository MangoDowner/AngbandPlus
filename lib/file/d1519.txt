T:As you've probably guessed, I am Christina, queen of Ivhala, although;
T:I'm an adventurer at heart. My philosophy is that politics have limited;
T:effect in this world. A leader needs to be powerful, and by that I mean;
T:being a great and mighty warrior. Some creatures in this world will never;
T:listen to words. When such creatures appears - and that's quite often -,;
T:what is a leader going to do? Sit in his throne and let his soldier die;
T:for him? Julian does that. Marek does that. Elowyn does that. But me? No.;

T:like everyone else, have families and loved ones. Soldiers aren't just;

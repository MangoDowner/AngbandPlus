T:However, if Professor Savius is as knowledgeable in orcish lore as he says,;
T:and if he really is the genius that he claims to be, he might have learned;
T:how to read Orcish, and might know what the text means. You decide to take;
T:a small sheet of paper, and retranscribe the text as best as you can.;
T:This way, you'll be able to show him the text, and he might be able to;
T:read it for you.;

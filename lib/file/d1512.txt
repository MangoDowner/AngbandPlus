I:Simon;
T:I see you are quite persistent, <NAME>. Even though you don't;
T:understand anything about my powers, you still chased me down here.;
T:You know that it is futile to fight me, right? Even if you defeat;
T:me again, I will just stand up. Because I will twist reality to save;
T:me from death.;

I:Simon;
T:But that would be a waste of time. So I will simply disappear, and;
T:go somewhere else for now. And you are powerless to prevent that, since;
T:my teleportation is also a twist of reality. It must feel bad to just;
T:stand there, powerless, in the face of a reality-defying entity like me...;

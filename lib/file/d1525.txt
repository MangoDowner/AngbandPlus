I:Man;
T:Everything is ready, lady Balcia. We took many of the Defenders that you;
T:and your order placed under your influence, and turned them into wights.;
T:We have over 500 of those 'Defender Wights' ready to be sacrificed in order;
T:to summon the allmighty Grey Wight, one of Ryoon's most powerful servant.;

I:Balcia;
T:Excellent work, Loroth. It seems we were right to ask for your help.;
T:Christina and <NAME> thought they could reverse our magic with;
T:the help of an Archfiend's powers. Well, in this case, we just had to;
T:ask for the help of worshippers of a rival Archfiend!;

T:Hehehe... Christina is a good-hearthed queen. Therefore, she has no ideas;
T:how to deal with Archfiends! She claims to be a friend of Shan, but in the;
T:world of Archfiends, there is no such things called 'friend'. Turning away;
T:from the gods, only to be deceived by a Sul-Rin... Christina's days are;
T:counted.;

T:the Grey Wight once we summon it. In fact, if the Grey Wight, no mere;
T:mortals will be able to stop it. It will require the intervention of;
T:gods and their champions. This will turn into an epic war between;
T:gods and demons, much to Ryoon's delight!;

T:to attack him, he is starting to take major wounds, and his life force has;
T:taken a significant blow. He is no longer laughing, and he is no longer;
T:amused... With his life force weakened, he has lost the ability to instantly;
T:recover his wounds while standing in fire.;

T:You have managed to cause some wounds to Pyrex, and his life force has been;
T:weakened. However, you notice the grin on his face. He isn't scared, rather,;
T:he seems to be quite amused.;

T:Mwhahaha! Incredible, <NAME>! You've actually managed to wound;
T:me! For a long time now, I have been looking for a powerful opponent,;
T:to push my abilities to their limit! Nothing excites me more than a;
T:violent, challenging battle, you see! However, I do have duties to accomplish;
T:here, and I cannot let you defeat me.;

T:That sounds more and more believable. Perhaps your power is so great;
T:that I couldn't properly sense it at first. Your strength definitely;
T:isn't that of an ordinary mortal. Wait! Does that mean you're a Demigod;
T:too, like Avemorsh? If that's the case, then your presence here would;
T:compromise all our plans!;

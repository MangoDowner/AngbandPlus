T:Demons... I am not surprised to see them here. By killing both Ophelia;
T:and Maelan, you did a double murder. You did one good deed, but tarnished;
T:it with an evil one. But in the end, you took the easy option, without;
T:really trying. I'd say the deed was more evil than good, which is why;
T:demons are here.;

T:That is not important. The laws of spiritual worlds would take too long;
T:to explain. What's important is that Ophelia's soul is now resting.;
T:I do not know for sure if she rests in peace or not. But I think that;
T:by slaying demons, you've helped ensure she would be happy in death.;
T:And for that, you deserve a reward.;

T:These magical bracers contains both light and darkness. They represent;
T:your act: killing an evil person, but also killing a good one. They represent;
T:neutrality. They represent grey. They will allow you to call forth both;
T:the forces of good, and the forces of evil.;

T:to go talk to Jeffrey.;

T:Normally, I would say that the slums are dangerous, but right now,;
T:they're quite safe compared to the horrors around the temple!!;
T:I'm glad I'm not stuck fighting those green-skinned monsters!;

T:This is the southwestern slums of Jindar. Really dangerous place, full;
T:of thieves, murderers, vermins... There are also lots of kobold citizens,;
T:and they are training assassins to fight against the devlings in the;
T:northeast slums. The southwest and northeast are the most dangerous places;
T:in Jindar... I can see that you're not too familiar with the place.;
T:I suggest you leave... or you'll be their target.;
A:Don't worry. I can hold my own in a fight.:0:0:0:1:3:0:0:0:0

I:Jindar Soldier;
T:...it's not that easy. Some of the rogues there are more than simple;
T:thugs. They are actually capable fighters, and they can use all sort of;
T:dirty tricks to fight us. We do our best to arrest them, but sometimes,;
T:they give us as much trouble as we give them. This is really bad...;
A:I see. Good bye.:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

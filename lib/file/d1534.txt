T:<NAME>... I'm sorry. I...I have betrayed Shan. I threw away her gift,;
T:and became a servant of Ryoon. I've tried to fight the Grey Wight, but he;
T:is just too strong. I...I've never seen a being that powerful. I have failed.;
T:Failed to protect Ivhala. Failed to be a queen...;
A:Rest in peace now, Christina. The Grey Wight will be defeated!:0:0:0:1:3:0:0:0:0

I:Christina;
T:Thanks you, <NAME>. I know that if there's one person in this world who;
T:can fight the Grey Wight, it's you. But I wonder just how long you'll;
T:be able to keep fighting. We are at a point where we might have to;
T:summon the help of greater beings to fight this threat. This enemy is;
T:unusually powerful. The cult of Ryoon is powerful in it's own right,;
T:but the real enemy is this order of chaos.;
A:Yes, and this Summapal, who seems to be their master.:0:0:0:1:4:0:0:0:0

T:Christina is now dead, her body lying on the ground. On this day, a mighty;
T:nation has fallen, and this is a victory for the order of chaos. The only;
T:thing you can do now is to find and defeat Balcia and the Grey Wight, so that;
T:at least, the death of Christina and Ivhala can be avenged.;

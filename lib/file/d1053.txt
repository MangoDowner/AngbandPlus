I:Geoffrey Harrington;
T:Glad to meet you, <NAME>. Recently, I have been the target of mysterious;
T:assassins. And to be honest, I have no idea why they suddently decided;
T:to attack me! I haven't made any important deals, I didn't meet with any;
T:suspicious persons, nothing. Everything has been going on normally. I mean,;
T:I do live in a mansion, and I do have some treasures, but Bertram, my most;
T:trusted treasure guard, didn't report anyone trying to steal my treasures.;
T:It almost seems like they're not coming here for the treasures...but for me;
T:personally!;

I:Geoffrey Harrington;
T:And there's no way to recognise them easily either. The first one who came;
T:here was wearing a black cloak and attacked me with a poisoned short sword.;
T:But the second assassin was a beautiful woman, who was passing for a simple;
T:lady who wanted to become my new maid. Turns out she was a witch, and she;
T:burned two of my guards with her fireballs! I would have been burned as well;
T:if Bertram didn't cover me. He was able to kill her, thanks the Creator.;

I:Geoffrey Harrington;
T:The last assassin who came was a dwarf! He was pretending to be a mercenary;
T:who wanted to help me find the assassins. So I had him come in my room, and;
T:then, he took his axe, and charged toward me! Fortunately, my guards were;
T:nearby, and they killed him, but that dwarf was still able to kill one;
T:of them. This is really bad! None of these attacks have anything in common,;
T:so it doesn't point to any specific guilds or clans. But there has been many;
T:attempts, so they must all be working for the same person, or group.;

I:Geoffrey Harrington;
T:No! That's the problem, I have no ideas! None of these assassins had;
T:anything in common, except a desire to kill me. That doesn't point toward;
T:any directions, doesn't give us any hints of who they might be!;
T:That's why I hired you, so you could investigate this matter. I'm sorry,;
T:but I can't give you any more advices. All I can say is good luck, and if;
T:you learn anything, let me know!;

I:Geoffrey Harrington;
T:Ah yes, Bertram, my most trusted guard. Very powerful warrior, I tell you!;
T:Even if all my other guards teamed up against him, I'm not sure they;
T:would be able to defeat him. He personally guard my most precious treasure,;
T:a family heirloom passed from generations to generations to the eldest;
T:sons and daughters of the Harrington family. So this ring means a lot;
T:to me, and because it has magical powers, it could become dangerous should;
T:it fall in the wrong hands. But with Bretram around, I don't think any;
T:thieves will ever be able to take it.;

T:No. Why? Because with the power he has, if he wanted to take my ring,;

T:even think the regular city guards could have stopped him. He has been;
T:around for about 10 years now, so I trust him.;

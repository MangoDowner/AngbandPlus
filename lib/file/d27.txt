T:Greetings, beautiful lady. I really like the way you look. You'd make;
T:a very pleasant concubine to me, perhaps even a bride!. However, I can't;
T:say that I appreciate you killing my dark minions. So here's my offer: ;
T:I shall turn you into a vampire, and then, you and I can serve the forces; 
T:of darkness together. Do not worry. It will be painless, and you will;
T:find the form of a vampire very pleasant.;
A:I'll never be the bride of a vampire!:0:0:0:1:2:0:0:0:0

T:I cannot let you espace, I must have you. It is sad that I have to knock;
T:you down first, but do not worry, after that, you and I will be close...;
T:forever!;

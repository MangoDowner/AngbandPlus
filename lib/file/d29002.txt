T:I've heard there's a very dangerous sphere-type enemy that absorbs damages;
T:based on the attacker's resistances to elemental forces. Apparently, even;
T:if you're immune to only one force, it will absorb any forms of attacks.;
T:Having several resistances will also allow it to absorb attacks if you have;
T:too many of them. And don't waste your time with magical attacks, it will;
T:not work. I hope I never encounter this monster...;

Cursed Treasure Seeker(Passive)

Effect: Improves quality of magic items based on your Misfortune.
Bonus to magic item rank: 10% of Misfortune.
Bonus chance to get levelables: +5% of Misfortune.
Extra points: Bonus to magic item rank increases by 20%.
              +(5% of Misfortune) to chance of finding levelables.
              With 5 or more points, the Misfortune penality of raising the
              chance to find "bad" magic items is completely negated, and you
              won't actually get a chance to get "bad" magic items at all.

This passive ability will increase the quality of all magic items you find
based on your Misfortune level, as well as raise the chance of getting
levelable items as opposed to normal magic items. Furthermore, if you have
five or more points in this ability, you will no longer have a chance to
find badly rolled magic items, and that regardless of your Misfortune.

ABOUT NIGHTMARE ABILITIES:

These abilities are a separate set of abilities that you can learn by defeating
Nightmare Horrors, and using their licialhyds. They do not require ability
points to learn, although they do count toward the total abilities limit.
Each Nightmare Horror has a different ability. You may learn a new ability, or
improve a learned one, once every 3 levels. Both normal races and monsters
may learn these abilities.

T:Well, not much I'm afraid. We have a few shops, and you could;
T:also take a drink to the tavern, if so you wish. And then there's;
T:that old Richard, who lives by the water. Used to be a sailor,;
T:now he is a mere fisherman who fish in a small pond of water!;

T:Other than that, well, there was once the old caves to the north,;
T:but because it was full of wild beasts and bandits, walls were built;
T:to close the access to the caves, so peoples wouldn't go there anymore;
T:and beasts and bandits would stay away from our town.;

T:Finally, there's the town hall. Mayor Princeton is a good guy, and has;
T:been the mayor for almost 10 years already. He did his best to maintain;
T:Udor as a peaceful rural town, and he so far, he has quite succeeded.;
T:If you're looking for work, perhaps you should go see him. He may have;
T:a job for someone like you.;

T:More and more peoples claims to see orcs these days... It's strange...;
T:Of course, ever since they were defeated milleniums ago, a few peoples;
T:always claimed to have seen some orc survivors, although this has always;
T:been proven wrong. Also, have you heard rumors that amongst the new peoples;
T:who claims to see orcs, many of them disappeared? It's quite scary!;

T:I have heard the barman is having vermin problems in the tavern. I've also;
T:heard some peoples complaining of an increasing number of rats and rodents;
T:around the town. Could it be that the tavern is having a serious rat;
T:problem?;

T:Aparently, some of the town's guards opened the north walls, and went down;
T:the old caves, to patrol the underground, and make sure everything was;
T:correct... they never came back. This is bad! Normally, our guards can;
T:handle the common wild beasts and bandits rather easily... Could there;
T:be something really dangerous down there? I prefer not thinking too much;
T:about it...;

I:Townsfolk;
T:But I bet this is only rumors, and that if peoples disappear, it must be;
T:a group of assassins or thieves or something like that who hide their;
T:schemes behind orc stories... Anyway... do you have any other questions?;

T:If that's the case though, the barman probably won't speak too much about;
T:it. That would not be good for business... Any other questions?;

T:here. You could always go to the town hall, and see if the mayor has;
T:anything for you. Otherwise... well, perhaps Udor is just not for you.;

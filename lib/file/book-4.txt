HUNTING WEAPONS
---------------

Written by Shayla The Huntress

As a hunter, I generally like to use weapons that allow me
to strike down my preys from a safe distance. There are
various of those weapons, and you can easily create them
if you have some skill in the art of weapon crafting. They
are simple and very effective!

SPEAR
Component type: Crafting
Skills required: Crafting(2)
How to create: Iron Spike + Wood Pole

The spear, a great weapon for hunting! Allow you to trust
your foes from a short distance, so you can easily finish
them off in close combat afterwards. Unlike most polearms,
the simple spear is one-handed, and can be used with some
sort of shield.

FINE STEEL SPEAR
Component type: Crafting
Skills required: Crafting(5)
How to create: Spear + Steel Ore

Steel is a fine metal, and I found a way to combine the
simple one-handed spear into this fine piece of crafting.
Much better than the common spear, and still one-handed,
this weapon is my favorite of all!

This is for the melee weapons I use. Now, of course, I am
trained with ranged weapons. Here's how you can create
them in a most simple way:

SHORT BOW
Component type: Crafting
Skills required: Crafting(1)
How to create: Wooden Parts + Rope

The most basic bow you could ever create. A simple bow,
with fairly good range, good for anyone who starts learning
how to shoot. You may wish to upgrade to the long bow
though...

LONG BOW
Component type: Crafting
Skills required: Crafting(5)
How to create: Short Bow + Short Bow

You just made two nice short bows. Now, unmake them, and
use their combined parts to make one, bigger bow. You get
the long bow! Fires faster, stronger and better! Any
serious marksman should get this!

SLING
Component type: Crafting
Skills required: Crafting(0)
How to create: Leather + Rope

The sling is not the best ranged weapon, but some hunters
like it. I guess it has it's uses to one skilled with such
a weapon... It can also be used as a toy for kids!

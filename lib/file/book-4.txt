Written by a Rhyzendalian priest of the Golden Sul-Rin.



Before Rhyzendal became populated with the demonic race, it was only a
large, barren wasteland of ice and snow. But many demon worshippers were
hiding there, hoping no one would dare to brave the cold and the glaciers
to come and find them. Only a few powerful adventurers ever dared to go
after the evil cultists. The cultists then used their new land to summon
lesser demons, and bound them to themselves, forcing them to become their
slaves. The demons they summoned were mostly humanoid in appearance, much like
today's Rhyzendalians. They made excellent slaves, and allowed the cultists
to conquer the cold wastelands with their demonic servants. They started
summoning more and more of these tormented demons, eventually hoping to
create powerful armies, so they could wage war against the other kingdoms.

But one day, a summoner performed a ritual to summon more slaves. A portal
opened, but no lesser demons came out. Instead came out an extremely
seductive woman, with golden hairs and eyes, and a fair skin. At that time,
they thought they summoned a celestial by mistake, but it was actually much
worse than that. The woman was a Sul-Rin, a kind of greater Archfiends.
Normally, the hairs and eyes of a Sul-Rin are blue, not golden, but this
particular Sul-Rin was born from the hope of freedom the demonic
slaves. A feeling never felt before by demons, but having spent a long
time outside of hell, the evil inside their hearts eventually started to fade.

The cultists united their clans, and tried to fight the Archfiend. It was
a futile battle. Even though they had been capable of enslaving thousands
of lesser demons, a single Archfiend proved to be enough to defeat them all.
The cultists were not able to resist to the incredibly seductive appearance
of the Sul-Rin. All she had to do then is make them disappear in a flash
of blinding light. The cultists defeated, the demons were finally free.
However, the evil of hell had already left their bodies, and they couldn't
return there. They had no choice but to start a new life in the cold lands
of Rhyzendal.

The Sul-Rin introduced herself as Shan. She explained to the demons that
she was born from their hope, and was ready to guide them, and help them
start a new life here. And thus, she gave the peoples of Rhyzendal three
blessings known as the Gifts of the Sul-Rin:

1. Daylight. With the eternal nights of Rhyzendal, the demons could never
sleep, and without the ability to rest, they would eventually become insane.
Thus, the Sul-Rin blessed Rhyzendal with a short period of daylight everyday,
so that the demons could rest and avoid insanity.

2. Knowledge. As an Archdemon, she had milleniums of knowledge within her
soul, and she shared this knowledge with all her peoples. This allowed
them to become craftsmen and carpenters, and build cities.

3. Toughness. The demons coming from a plane of flames, they could hardly
bear the coldness of Rhyzendal. But the Sul-Rin gave them the toughness,
endurance and constitution needed to resist the cold. Centuried later,
this toughness has grown, and the demons of Rhyzendal became the most
cold-resistant of the civilized races.

With her people blessed, the Sul-Rin's mission was accomplished. To thanks
her, the demons of Rhyzendal built a grand palace of ice for their new
goddess. Shan accepted the gift, and also accepted to become the goddess
of Rhyzendal. Temples and churches devoted to Shan are now numerous in
Rhyzendal, and her followers can be found in every Rhyzendalian cities.

When we speak of religious peoples, we always think of the Nimbrayans, or
the priests of the Creator in Jindar. But what most peoples don't realize
is that the population of Rhyzendal is at least as large as the population
of Nimbraya, and most of the Rhyzendalians are followers of Shan. Plus,
Shan worshippers are starting to spread outside of Rhyzendal as well,
making the Sul-Rin even more powerful than ever before.

Finally, I would invite every followers of Shan to go on a journey of
pilgrimage to Shan's palace. The Grand Palace of the Sul-Rin is located
in northern Rhyzendal at coordinates (41,8). There, you can meet the
grand priest of Shan, Ludgar Zos, who will bless you with the gifts of
the Sul-Rin.

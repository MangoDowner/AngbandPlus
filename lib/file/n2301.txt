Restless Force(Active/Passive)

Effect: Much like a Restless Dead, you regenerate a % of your hp every turns.
        You can also activate this ability to cast a powerful wave of fire
        a your enemies that is based on your melee damages.
% of hp healed per turns: 1%
Damage: Normal weapon damage + 4%/Misfortune (max 20%)
Radius: 1 (chain attack, range 30) + 1/3 Misfortune (max 10)
Element: Fire
Extra points: +1% hp healed per turns for every 3 points, up to a maximum of
              10% at 30 points.
              +20% to damage.

The passive effect of this ability allows you to regenerate some of your hp
every turns. The more hp you have, the more noticeable this effect is, and a few
points in this can easily make you nearly untouchable by lesser enemies. It is
recommended to combine this ability with defensive abilities, so that you won't
take much damage, and what you do take you will regenerate it quickly.

The active effect will cast a powerful chain of fire at enemies that is based
on your base melee damage. This ability is still treated as a melee attack,
despite the range and area of effect, so you do not need to raise Spellcraft
or Elemental skill for this ability to be effective.

ABOUT NIGHTMARE ABILITIES:

These abilities are a separate set of abilities that you can learn by defeating
Nightmare Horrors, and using their licialhyds. They do not require ability
points to learn, although they do count toward the total abilities limit.
Each Nightmare Horror has a different ability. You may learn a new ability, or
improve a learned one, once every 3 levels. Both normal races and monsters
may learn these abilities.

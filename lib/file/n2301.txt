Ghostly Misfortune(Passive)

Effect: Your body becomes ghostlike, allowing you to pass through walls and
        gain resistance to physical attacks. Also allows you to use your
        Misfortune to get a chance to cancel out any attacks.
Physical resistance bonus: +10%
Attack cancelling power: 33% of Misfortune.
Extra points: +10% resistance to Physical.
              +33% of Misfortune to cancelling power.

This passive ability will give you resistance to Physical attacks,
and if your Misfortune is at least as high as the dungeon level you're in,
you will gain the ability to move through walls. Also, you will get a chance
to counter any attacks that enemies uses on you, based on your Misfortune
level, this ability's level and the monster's level + stat, which can be
strength for melee attacks, dexterity for ranged attacks or mind for
magic attacks.

ABOUT NIGHTMARE ABILITIES:

These abilities are a separate set of abilities that you can learn by defeating
Nightmare Horrors, and using their licialhyds. They do not require ability
points to learn, although they do count toward the total abilities limit.
Each Nightmare Horror has a different ability. You may learn a new ability, or
improve a learned one, once every 3 levels. Both normal races and monsters
may learn these abilities.

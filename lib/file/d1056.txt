T:Awww, why did he refers you to me? I told him I'm busy and do not want;
T:to be disturbed! I'm trying to create some new spells, and I have no time;

I:Adrianna;
T:Anyway... As Randar probably told you, we went to visit Mr. Harrington,;
T:as he was looking for mercenaries to track assassins. We couldn't find;
T:them, and when we returned, he forgot about us, and now he thinks that;
T:the assassins were peoples that looks exactly like me, Randar and Tom.;
T:What about you, how did he describe the assassins to you?;
A:At first it was you three, but then it was me and two of my contacts.:0:0:0:1:6:0:0:0:0

I:Adrianna;
T:I see. So the same thing happened to you. This is very strange...;
T:Randar suggested that perhaps Mr. Harrington was just playing tricks;
T:on us, but I disagree. He really didn't seem to be kidding when he;
T:says he doesn't remember us. I think there's something else going on.;
A:Do you have any ideas?:0:0:0:1:7:0:0:0:0

I:Adrianna;
T:Not sure if you've noticed, but Harrington's maid was also affected;
T:by the loss of memory. So I don't think Mr. Harrington is the only;
T:victim here. I think something is affecting the entire place.;
T:Perhaps everything is not as it seems in the mansion. Perhaps there;
T:is a force at work that we do not see, but that's affecting the;
T:memories of the peoples in the mansion.;

I:Adrianna;
T:Hmmm... to solve this case, you will have to find out exactly what's;
T:causing the force to be active. I know Mr. Harrington has a family;
T:heirloom, but I don't think that's the problem. It would be way too;
T:obvious. It's probably something else. Perhaps you should speak to;
T:Tom. With a bit of luck, perhaps he found something inside or around;
T:the mansion that would point to the source of the invisible force.;
T:He lives in a house southeast of the district.;
A:Thanks, I'll go see him then.:0:0:0:1:9:0:0:0:0

T:We're a peaceful little town, near the city of Jindar, and between;
T:other towns like Udor to the south, and Vilgor to the west. We are;
T:a stop for those who travels to these places, and therefore, our;
T:inn is often visited by all kind of persons. Adventurers, traders...;
T:Lots of peoples.;

T:Protecting our town is Evolia, an elven priestess of Dalunia, the;
T:elven goddess of nature. She lives in the temple west of the town.;
T:It is surrounded by trees, so you can't miss it. She is a wise,;
T:good hearted woman who always helps peoples in need, and she is the;
T:one who helps us when evil arise from below the earth...;

T:Not far from the town, to the northwest lies the ruins of an old temple.;
T:Now, it is infested with undead creatures. Sometimes, they will come near;
T:this town, but the priestess has placed a magic barrier that prevents;
T:undeads from entering. So as long as she protects out town, the undeads;
T:will never attack us!;

T:the inn, some peoples might have some useful information for you. It's;
T:right next to the armor shop!;

T:I have heard that the town of Udor was attacked by legions of weird;
T:monsters, and peoples claim that they were orcs! I don't really believe;
T:the 'orcs' thing, but... I hope they were able to repulse these creatures.;
T:We are lucky here, the priestess protects us, but in Udor, they only;
T:have a few guards... and they lack serious training, if you ask me.;

T:No, I don't know anything about it. And I don't care either. Walmus;
T:is just a fool who thinks he is so great because he killed a few;
T:creatures. They were weak creatures that any adventurers could have killed;
T:easily. If I were you, I wouldn't bother helping him. You'll regret;
T:it in the end.;

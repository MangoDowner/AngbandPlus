T:give you. Only a high priest or high ranked Golden Knight could give;
T:you this kind of treasure. So once you have accomplished your task,;
T:we will contact the necessary peoples. But it will not be us who will;

T:that Shan is the one and only true leader. After all, politics pale in;
T:comparison to an Archfiend's powers. But other nations would be too scared;

I:Townsfolk;
T:Some peoples calls Ivhala the "Metallic Kingdom". And I supposed I agree;
T:with that. We have the best smiths, the best weapons and the best armors;
T:you can find in Portralis. And the Agharias mountains hides many rare;
T:and valuable ores. And the Defenders are made of steel! So as you can see,;
T:Ivhala really IS the Metallic Kingdom!;

I:Townsfolk;
T:There are many places, but if you can't find anything, I would suggest;
T:starting by visiting the Mithril Wall store. One of the best smiths,;
T:Garek Silverbeard, often needs the help of adventurers to gather ores;
T:and other stuff from the mountains. I'm sure he would have something;
T:for you.;

I:Townsfolk;
T:I've heard diplomatic ties between Ivhala and Jindar have been worsening;
T:lately. Can't say I'm surprised though. Jindar may be big, but they're;
T:weak! They have a large army, but how many soldiers would it take to;
T:defeat a single of our Defenders? A lot of adventurers gathers there,;
T:but they are very costly to hire! Jindar imports tons of ressources;
T:from everywhere else, but they can't do anything with them! And finally,;
T:the city is full of criminal organizations! In fact, they probably;
T:control most of the kingdom. In other words, they're not very worthy;
T:allies at all!;

I:Townsfolk;
T:The only place more dangerous than the Agharias mountains would be the;
T:Rhyzendalian glaciers. Or Rhyzendal in general. They're not bad folks,;
T:despite some of their 'odd' customs, but their country is impossible;
T:to live in! The cold is extremely harsh, and some of the beasts that;
T:lives there makes our Defenders looks weak. At least here, in the;
T:Agharias mountains, you have a chance to survive... Well, sometimes;
T:anyway.;

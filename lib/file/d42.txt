I:Townsfolk;
T:This is the town of Ophelia. It's named about the woman of the same name;
T:who lived here ages ago. She was a passionate and kind lady who,;
T:unfortunately, never got the respect she deserved. Poor woman... she;
T:endured so much pain, for nothing. A sad example of how cruel peoples;
T:can be. You might want to speak with Mr. Jeffrey, the town's mayor.;
T:He is also an historian, and knows much about Ophelia's story. You can;
T:find him in the town hall, the large building to the north of the town.;

T:There's a young woman who used to work for the alchemy store who has now;
T:opened her own little shop next to it. She just completed her studies,;
T:and claims to be an 'Imbuer' or something. Not sure if she's all that great;
T:though, she sounds quite inexperienced. But perhaps she's better than;
T:she seems.;

T:There are many myths and legends about vampires. Tales of seductive;
T:undead lords and beautiful vampire princesses. But I've heard that real;
T:vampires are actually little more than blood drinking zombies, according;
T:to some so-called 'vampire hunters'. They're nothing like the immortal;
T:dark lords that the legends describes. A good thing if you ask me. There's;
T:enough scary creatures that lives in underground caves already, we don't;
T:need more of them.;

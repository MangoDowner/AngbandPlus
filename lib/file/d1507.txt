T:A cockatrice is a big, rooster-like creature with a lizard's tail.;
T:It possesses a breath attack that petrifies it's foes, but it really;
T:isn't much different than any Earth-elemental spells casted by mages;
T:and Elemental Lords. Our soldiers can usually handle them, but;
T:there have been reports of a new specie of large, aggressive, and;
T:powerful cockatrices. That is what needs to be investigated.;

T:Normally, we can handle a cockatrice attack with a few soldiers.;
T:They might be a challenge to weaker adventurers and rookies, but;
T:a few Defenders can beat them. However, there have been reports of a new;
T:specie of very large cockatrices, which are not only much more powerful,;
T:but also very aggressive. This has been confirmed by a small team I sent;
T:a few days ago. One of these new species attacked savagely, brutally slaying;
T:three of the team's ten Defenders, while petrifying five others. Only two;
T:came back. Right now, they are still located in the Cockatrices Sanctuary,;
T:a small cave outside the city, they haven't come out of the cave, but we;
T:won't wait until they do. And this is where you come in.;

T:First, you need to fight your way through the Cockatrices Sanctuary. It's a;
T:cave outside the city, not too far away from the entrance where cockatrices;
T:lives. You can't really miss it. There are often Cockatrices Hunters around;
T:it as well. Amateurish adventurers for the most part... Anyway, know that the;
T:cockatrices are actually the lesser threat in there, and it is filled with;
T:all kind of much more powerful monsters. To tell you the truth, the soldiers;
T:I sent actually tried to avoid fighting as much as possible. Try to not get;
T:lost either. This cave is as big and dangerous as any other caves of the;
T:Agharias mountains!;

T:Second, look for any clues that might point out to why these new species;
T:started appearing. And finally, should you find the source of the problem,;
T:try to stop it. It is important that these new species be exterminated;
T:before they become too dangerous. The Agharias mountains are dangerous;
T:enough already, we don't need more powerful monsters. Once you've;
T:accomplished all that, you will be greatly rewarded for your effort.;

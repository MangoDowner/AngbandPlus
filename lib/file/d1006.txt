T:There are two districts in Jindar where the poorest peoples and many;
T:thieves and thugs lives. These are the southwest and the northeast;
T:slums. Both south and north have their share of thugs and thieves.;
T:The main difference is that to the south, there are kobolds, and to;
T:the north, there are devlings. And the kobolds and devlings are;
T:at war against each others...;

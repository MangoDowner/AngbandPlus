I:Knight of Balance;
T:Welcome, <CLASS>. I am called the Knight of Balance, and I am a guardian.;
T:Behind the doors you see on the northern wall is a powerful treasure,;
T:which has been sealed inside this cave for generations. It is a powerful,;
T:dangerous treasure, containing a power which could alter reality itself.;
T:As such, I cannot let anyone have it, whether it is for good or evil.;
T:It makes no difference to me. Anyone who wants the treasure will have;
T:to face me.;
A:But I need the 'Tear of Justice' to save Jindar!!:1:1013:1:1:3:0:0:0:0

T:The 'Tear of Justice'? Is that how you call the treasure? I have never;
T:heard of this name. But how you call it does not matter, nor does;
T:your good intent, either. Nobody can take the treasure unless they;
T:defeat me. If you want it, you need to defeat me.;

I:Knight of Balance;
T:Well done, <CLASS>. You have earned the right to possess the treasure.;
T:However, hear my words of warning... The treasure behind this door;
T:contains a power that is both unstable and unpredictable. This very power;
T:cannot be used by simple magical means. Activating this stone would;
T:probably instantly destroy you in a most painful and horrible death.;
T:And then, the chaotic magic that would be unleashed could easily;
T:kill thousands of other people before fading!;

T:that person already possess some powers similar to those of the treasure.;
T:Do not let him have it, or the consequences would be far beyond your;
T:powers, or anyone else in your city for that matter... Protect the;
T:treasure with your life. Do not let him have it!;

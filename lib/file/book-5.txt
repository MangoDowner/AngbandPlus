I. THE GODDESS AND HER CREATIONS

According to the legends, the goddess Dalunia is the one who created
life. Plants, animals and her most perfect creation, the elvish race,
a race of intelligent beings who are no longer bound by primitive
instinct and have the ability to think, learn and create. All forms
of life were created by the goddess's divine powers.

Her first creation was fertile earth. From a desert of rocks and stones,
she turned the solid rock into soft earth. Then, she poored water on
the earth to make it fertile, and a fertile land of earth where plants
could grow was created. The goddess also took water from the sea, and
after removing the salt, she created large and deep pools in the earth,
and placed the pure water in these giant pools, thus creating lakes
of pure water needed for the plants to grow.

Her second creation was the plants. With the earth full of fresh water,
plants started growing. It all started with molds and gress appearing,
and then some larger plants and flowers appeared. And one day, one
plant became very tall, with a trunc made of wood, and thus the first
tree was born. The tree grew many offsprings, and soon, large forests
of trees covered the land.

Her third creation was the animals. During the first fall season, leaves
fell on the ground. In direct contact with the fertile earth, these leaves
grew, became large, and their shape changed. They started to grow legs,
eyes and fur... and thus, the first animals were born. Rodents were the
first animals to walk on the earth. Then, some of the rodents grew wings
and became the birds, who would fly sky high above the forest. But some
of the leaves did not yet turn into animals. They continued growing, and
growing larger... Eventually becoming the goddess's fourth and greatest
creation...

Her fourth creation is the race of Elves. Two-legged beings, with a great
wisdom and intelligence, capable of thinking and inventing, and with a pair
of dextrous hands to handle a variety of tools. Elves also had a longevity
much longer than other animals, allowing them to learn much more, and
thus, the elves became the powerful guardians of nature, protecting the
forests and the weaker forms of life.

After creating life, the goddess disappeared, and never came back to the
land she created. She thought that if she would stay there, the elves would
rely on her to live, instead of their own skills and abilities. So she
left her land, so that the elves would learn by themselves and become
independant. However, the elves would still worship her, so that she could
give them blessings and good luck in times of need, should danger arise.

II. THE APPEARENCE OF THE GODDESS

The physical appearance of the goddess is disputed amongst the priests. The
most common theories portrays Dalunia as a brown-skinned, middle-aged
woman with hairs made of long grass, and water flowing trough her veins
instead of blood. Another common portrait of Dalunia describes an elderly
woman with a skin made of bark, and hairs made of water. Some theories
portray her as being half-woman, half-tree, with the upper body of a woman
with hairs made of plants and a skin of bark, and her lower body is that
of a giant oak tree. Finally, some priests claims that the goddess has
the power to alter any living bodies, including her own, and therefore
can appear into any of these three forms as she wishes.

III. CONTROVERSIES, MISCONCEPTIONS

While some peoples thinks of Dalunia as the origin of everything that exists
today, it is important to understand that while Dalunia created the life,
she did not create the world. She, too, was a creation of Roh, the eternal
void. Therefore, one common controversy is that if the goddess created the
life, as a living being herself, how was she created? How can she be the
creator of life, if she has been created herself? A common response to that
is that the goddess is not really a living being, but rather a divine force
in an incarnated body. Having no living body and being the very essence of
life, that makes Dalunia an immortal force who takes the form of an elven
woman, rather than an actual, real, living elf woman. However, some priests
insists that Dalunia is a living being, that she HAS to be a living being,
for life is what she represents. With every living beings being a part
of Dalunia's life force, they say that the goddess is immortal and cannot
age or die, as long as all other forms of life continues to exist.

Another common controversy is the presence of the other races, mainly
humans and dwarves. For a long time, elves were described as the perfect
and mightiest of the races. However, humans and dwarves have been found
to be just as powerful as the elves. Some priests claims that the humans
and dwarves are actually descendants of the very first elves, who, due to
a life in different conditions, evolved differently, explaining the
difference between the bodies of humans, elves and dwarves. However, many
priests do not believe this theory, and claims that there may be other
gods of life, who each created their own chosen races. Therefore, all
non-elvish races would be the creation of a different god... another
theory that creates controversy amongst those who believes that Dalunia
is the one and only goddess of life...

IV. WORSHIPPERS OF DALUNIA

A worshipper of Dalunia is one that recognize Dalunia as the mother of
all life, plants, animals, elves and other races. A worshipper of Dalunia
respects and protect nature, animals and all the evolved races.
A worshipper of Dalunia will help those in need, protect the life of
others, protect animals and plants, and battle against those who would
wish to take away innocent lives or those that are a threat to the
balance of nature. A warrior-priest of Dalunia will use blunt weapons
and will shun blades and axes, as these weapons have the power to cut
the plants and trees, and therefore they are a threat to nature.
A worshipper of Dalunia must marry and have children, for giving birth
to a child is to create life, therefore strenghtening the divine life
force of the goddess. A worshipper of Dalunia must put his or her fortune
to the good of other. They may keep the goods they need to survive, but
they must give the rest to those in needs, for everyone must be able to
live a long, healthy life.

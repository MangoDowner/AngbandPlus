T:What's going on is that a restless spirit has not been put to rest.;
T:Her nightmare lives on. It could have ended, had you made her smile.;
T:But you didn't. And now she is more sad than ever. Her nightmare is;
T:growing stronger. Why did you reinforce her nightmare? The spirits;
T:of nightmare will revive...;
A:I had my reasons. Now, why don't you show yourself once and for all?:0:0:0:1:3:0:0:0:0

T:so has an evil one. Both are now resting. I don't think they are at peace.;

I:Mayor Princeton;
T:Udor was founded about 300 years ago. It's a fairly young town. It all;
T:started in the mountain kingdom of Ivhala, in a Licialhyd mine. Working;
T:in the mines were poor workers, and they were forced to do hard and;
T:dangerous labors. In return, they received a few coins, barely enough;
T:to buy a descent meal at the end of the day. Many peoples died in the;
T:mines due to poor conditions...;

I:Mayor Princeton;
T:But one day, the miners decided to revolt, and fight for their rights!;
T:They asked for more human conditions, and for higher salaries. Naturally,;
T:the king of Ivhala back then, King Browen II, refused to comply to the;
T:request of the workers, and sent his soldiers to force the workers to;
T:return to work! A fight errupted... and unfortunately, the workers were;
T:losing the battle...;

T:keep fighting. Eventually, they were forced to flee Ivhala. They managed to;
T:leave the kingdom, and eventually entered the kingdom of Jindar. They;
T:travelled for several months, until they finally came here. And they;
T:decided to build a new town, and start a new life, away from the mountains;

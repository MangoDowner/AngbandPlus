MAKING YOUR OWN JEWELRY

What would a woman be without jewelry? Rings, amulets... they make us
look so beautiful! But jewelry is extremely expensive, isn't it? A nice
gold ring is very costly, and only the wealthiest women can afford them.
Unfortunately, I'm not one of these wealthy women. I can't afford a
beautiful diamond-incrusted gold ring.

However, I did find a solution to my problem. If I can't buy rings and
amulets, then why not make my own? It really isn't that hard. First,
you need a mold. And then you need some metal. Then, here's how you do
it:

(She describes how you have to melt the metal, poor it in the mold,
then she gives several tips on how to give a nice round shape to the ring,
and how to make a nice chain for the amulet.)

There you go, you now have your own custom-made piece of jewelry! Wasn't
too hard, wasn't it? If it's your first time crafting rings and amulets,
I suggest you start with an easy metal, like bronze. But you could
make jewelry out of any metals you find, assuming you are a skilled
craftsman or craftswoman.

Have fun making your own pieces of jewelry! It will cost you a lot less
than buying them, and it will look even nicer, and will fit your fingers
and neck better!

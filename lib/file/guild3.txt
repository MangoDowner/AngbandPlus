Are you a good person?  Only the best of people may devote their life to
the work of our holy deity.  By entering into our church, you will be
required to use the power granted to you to defeat all evil that crosses
your path.  You will be able to use "magical" powers granted to you, and
instruments of god will find their way into your hands to help you in your
task.  Becoming a priest will increase your wisdom, constitution and
charisma.

In devoting your life to god, you will be granted the use of the first
holy prayer book, a hafted weapon, a healing potion and a special gift.

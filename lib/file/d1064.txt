T:This chilling darkness... I have a bad feeling about it. Something's going;

T:I guess you're right. But this darkness is unnatural. Something's happening;
T:down there, and it can't be good for us. Will you go check it out?;

T:I bet this is the work of this necromancer, Delviaz. He wasn't there;
T:when the Lancers attacked. But now that our headquarters are full of dead;

T:he seems to have a different agenda than other Lancers, and seems far more;
T:dangerous. Good luck!;

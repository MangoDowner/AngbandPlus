T:to fire bolts made of this energy, but if you are talented in Mysticism;
T:magic, you might be able to cast a Smite Undeads spell. That should work too.;
T:Of course, this is only to finish him off. Feel free to use any kind of;
T:attacks on him, but if you can use light-based attacks, this would have;

T:Well... I've spent many years living in underground dungeons, where all sort;
T:of monsters lives. Frequent contact with all sort of creatures led me to;
T:learn about a lot of things... many of which are dangerous secrets.;
T:Don't worry, <NAME>! I don't plan on becoming a minion of Kysoroth;
T:anytime soon!;
A:I want to look for Kysoroth. Where should I begin?:0:0:0:1:42:0:0:0:0

I:Nidem;
T:What?? Look for Kysoroth...as in, you want to destroy Kysoroth??;
T:You'd better forget about this, <NAME>, it is not possible for a;
T:mortal to even stare at a being like Kysoroth! With that said, the best;
T:way you could hurt him is to defeat his followers and minions. For that,;
T:you'll have to search for his various temples in Portralis. You've already;
T:found one, but you'll need to figure out how to enter it, and then you'll;
T:have to look for other temples as well. I'm afraid that's all I can tell;
T:you. I do not know how to open the temples, nor where they are.;

SECRET LEVELS
---------------

Congratulations, you have discovered a Secret Level!

Secret Levels are extremely difficult quest levels that will truly push your
character to his/her limits. Though the challenge is great, so are the rewards.
Secret Levels are available in some dungeons, and requires you to find the
proper key to unseal the sealed stairway. Look for them on the last floor
of a specific dungeon.

SCALED ENEMIES

Secret Levels features many scaled enemies, meaning that their power is scaled
with your own level. This means that whether you are level 20 or level 50,
the monsters will remain challenging. You can tell an enemy is a scaled enemy
by looking at the color of it's stats, which appears in indigo color. Every
aspects of the monster are scaled: stats, skills, melee damages, magic damages,
etc... You will need more than just a high level to beat these monsters.
A good character build, properly leveled items and strategic planning will be
required to defeat them!

Note that scaled enemies do have a minimum level. When entering a Secret Level,
you'll get an introduction screen with the recommended level. If you are below
that level, it's a good idea to leave and level up before proceeding.

CHALLENGE

Enemies range from difficult to completely overwhelming. There may be unique
challenges specific to each Secret Levels as well. It may not always be
possible to simply attack enemies normally and hope to defeat them.
Maybe you will need to use combos of spells and abilities. Certain artifacts
or other items might also help you, and it is possible that you'll have to
exit the current dungeon and explore other ones until you find what you need.
If you cannot beat certain challenges, explore the world and come back later
when you think you have what it takes.

Note that it is not recommended that you attempt secret levels until you get
at least a fully levelable equipment, even if you are leveled enough.

DEATH

Fortunately, death is absent from Secret Levels. If you die, your death count
will not increase and you will not suffer the usual penalities for dying.
You will simply be teleported outside the dungeon. And should you recall
to the last level, the secret stairway will be waiting right next to you
for your next attempt. If you got any good items, you are free to keep them!
Because of that, it is always worth it to try beating Secret Levels,
as you have nothing to lose! Also, as you progress, some of this progress
will be marked as completed, so you will now have to start everything over.

REWARDS

Should you beat a Secret Level, you will earn 4 stat points, 10 skill points
and 2 ability points, as if you had just leveled up twice, except it doesn't
count as a level up. It's essentially free stats, skills and abilities!

SCORE

Clearing a secret level will be very benefical to your score! Every secret
levels you clear will raise your score by 25%. This, in addition to the
points you're going to make by defeating the monsters and the boss, will
be very benefical if you're aiming for high score!

TIPS AND TRICKS

- It will take you several tries in order to beat a level. Don't give up!
The game has many possibilities when it comes to abilities, spells and item
customization. Where one combination failed, another one might work
a lot better. If you keep dying, leave and explore the world for a while,
find new treasures, gain new powers, and come back later.
- When you beat the final challenge, all enemies will disappear. Which means
you do not actually have to kill everything. In fact, some enemies are
not to be trifled with at all, and avoiding them may be the solution
to progressing further!

Good luck!

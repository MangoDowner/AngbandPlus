I:Priest of the Creator;
T:The temple of the Creator seeks to bring happiness to the citizens of;
T:Portralis. Whether they come from Jindar, Karingen, Ivhala, Nimbraya;
T:or Rhyzendal, we help them when they are in need. The Creator's blessing 
T:will bring enlightment, healing and good fortune to anyone who receives it.;
T:But make no mistakes. We followers of the creator are not worshippers;
T:of holy light or the greater good. After all, the Creator has a darker side;
T:as well. As a result, we are also capable fighters or mages when we;
T:need to fight. And we will not hesite to kill anyone who wants to destroy;
T:our organization.;

I:Priest of the Creator;
T:We are the largest religious organization in all Portralis. However,;
T:there are still a lot of peoples who do not believe in the Creator.;
T:Most Nimbrayans, for example, believes in the Daldumarian religion,;
T:centered on the heroic teachings of the elven god Daldumaar. There;
T:are almost no temples of the Creator in Nimbraya. And then, you have;
T:all other lesser cults and lesser religions, some of them being;
T:demon worshippers. You should stay fay away from these dark cults...;

I:Priest of the Creator;
T:The Creator is the supreme being who created the world we live in.;
T:The most ancient entity to exist in our world, from his being;
T:emerged the infinite void, that contains everything. Then, he created;
T:masses of stones and earth, then created the air we breath and the;
T:water we drink. He then created some lesser creatures, and then,;
T:he created the humanoid races, including humans, dwarves, elves,;
T:kobolds, devlings, and all other intelligent races.;

T:From the creator's hand then emerged a beam of light that struck the;
T:females and mothers of the races. And from the other hand, a beam;
T:of darkness struck them. Ever since that day, when a child is born,;
T:his soul is made of light and darkness. Brighter souls will become;
T:forces of good, while the darker ones will become servants of evil.;
T:The very few children who did not receive the darkness became the;
T:holy beings known as Celestials, while the few children who received;
T:only the darkness became the Demons.;

I:Priest of the Creator;
T:The Creator decided that in order to maintain balance, the Celestials;
T:and the Demons had to be isolated from the other races, so he then;
T:created two dimmensional planes: Heaven and Hell, and banished both; 
T:the Celestials and the Demons to their respective planes. With the;
T:two races gone, life could go on with a balance of good and evil.;
T:We followers of the Creator strongly believe that the balance;
T:between good and evil must be maintained. As such, we help peoples;
T:in need, but we are also capable warriors and wizards when we must.;

I:Priest of the Creator;
T:Ever since that day, the races have lived and evolved. The Creator;
T:has been watching the balance ever since, and gave us his blessing;
T:ever since a threat to the balance of the world appeared.;
T:Of course, there is much more I could tell you, but perhaps it;
T:would be better if you look for the various books and tomes about;
T:the Creator. I do not have one with me, but if you look for them,;
T:you will be able to learn a lot more about our religion.;
A:But if I understand correctly, you're not really a religion of good?:0:0:0:1:8:0:0:0:0

I:Priest of the Creator;
T:An interesting point you're bringing up here. The Temple of the Creator;
T:IS a good organization, in that our goal is to protect the good;
T:and righteous part of the balance. However, there are also dark cults;
T:and demon worshippers who also claims to serve the Creator. These cults;
T:maintain the evil and dark side of the balance. So as long as both the;
T:good and evil worshippers of the Creator exists, the balance shall be;
T:maintained. We fight the evil ones, and they fight us. A fight that;
T:has raged for centuries, and will probably never end...;

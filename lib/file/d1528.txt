T:You enter a large room with a large dark pit. In the middle of the pit,;
T:standing on a floating platform, is Loroth Varos. From the dark pit, you;
T:can see several ghostly shapes coming out. Loroth seems to be gathering;
T:them, while chanting some sort of dark prayer.;

T:Greetings, <NAME>. Welcome to my summoning ritual! I am in the process;
T:of summoning the one who will reshape Ivhala!;

T:The problem, you see, is that the ritual is already ongoing! There is;
T:no way for you to stop it. If only the Shan worshippers had sent you;
T:straight to me, without having you waste your time slaying a small cult;
T:just to prove yourself worthy of an amulet... Oh, but the protocol;
T:had to be followed to the letter! Mwhahahaha!;

I:Loroth;
T:Let me guess. It's that fool Korthrax who sent you to me, correct?;
T:I do not regret betraying Shan. Shan herself isn't the problem though.;
T:It's her followers! A bunch of goody-two-shoes-wannabe, who don't;
T:seem to realize that Shan is an Archfiend, NOT a Goddess! Ryoon followers,;
T:on the other hand, knows perfectly who the Ghostfather is, and what;
T:it means to worship him.;

I:Loroth;
T:It means to sacrifice our body of flesh, and embrace a higher level of;
T:existance! Why live in flesh and endure pain and hunger? I have ascended;
T:to the realm of the phantoms, where I feel no pain, no hunger! And I get;
T:more power than I ever dreamed of! So why? Why are you wasting your time;
T:protecting the living, when you would do them much more good by letting;
T:them be turned into ghosts and wights? Tell me!;
A:I am a protector of the living. And you are insane!:0:0:0:1:6:0:0:0:0

T:lies about Shan being a being of good! She's an Archfiend! What part of it;

T:But in any cases, that chaos order's philosophy is similar to ours.;
T:To alter reality, to make it better. To revive the fallen races, and;
T:rewrite history. That's why they brought back the orcs into existance.;
T:That's also why we associated with them. We have a similar vision.;

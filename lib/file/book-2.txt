ALCHEMICAL HEALING
------------------

Written by an unknown author...

Alchemy is a powerful science! Mixing potions, creating some
great drinks... And what's more beautiful than healing
potions? Here are my discoveries:

POTION OF CURE LIGHT WOUNDS
Components type: Alchemy
Skill required: 1
How to create: Potion of Water + Medical Herbs

Your basic healing potion. Can cure some small wounds, but
don't expect miracles. You should try to transform it into
something better.

POTION OF CURE MEDIUM WOUNDS
Components type: Alchemy
Skill required: 10
How to create: Potion of Cure Light Wounds + Medical Herbs

More powerful than the one above. Seems like it's just a matter
of combining medical herbs with potions.

POTION OF CURE SERIOUS WOUNDS
Components type: Alchemy
Skill required: 15
How to create: Potion of Cure Medium Wounds + Medical Herbs

Even better, and still the same process of adding more herbs.
These herbs sure are potent.

POTION OF CURE CRITICAL WOUNDS
Components type: Alchemy
Skill required: 20
How to create: Potion of Cure Serious Wounds + Medical Herbs

Who would have guessed? Adding more herbs makes an even better
potion! And it's easy to make too! Unfortunately, this is as far as
it gets. These herbs do have their limits, and it's impossible to
add more to the mix. Still, I think this potion is quite powerful
as it is. Who would have thought it was so easy to heal wounds?
Doesn't revive the dead though... so don't get too confident just
because you create this.

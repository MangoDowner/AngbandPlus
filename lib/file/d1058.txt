T:Lord Zekis, Kur-Yun of Gems, also known as the Prince of Greed, or the;
T:Diamond of the Netherworld! A being that feeds on mortals greed and passion;
T:for material goods and gold! And this Mr. Harrigton is greedy enough;

T:One night, I sent one of my imps to spy the mansions. By chance, that;
T:imp found this old, secret basement! Must have been a secret treasure;
T:cave built by one of Harrington's ancestors or something. In any cases,;

T:me power, wealth, and revenge against those who hurted me. So I accepted.;
T:The criminals who were owning me are now dead, so I am now free. I have;

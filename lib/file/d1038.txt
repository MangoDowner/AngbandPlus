T:Haven't you heard of us? If not, then you must not live here in the;
T:northeast slums. Anyway, we're a guild of mercenaries and we basically;
T:accept any contracts. We always get the job done. We're all devlings,;
T:so we're fast, stealthy, agile and of course, the masters of polearms!;
T:In fact, in the guild, we especially value spear fighters. Hence our;
T:name, the Dragon Lancers. Because we have the might of the dragons!;
A:And you're popular in Jindar?:0:0:0:1:3:0:0:0:0

T:Well, we are here, in the northeast slums. But not in the southwest.;
T:The kobolds rule over that territory with their amateur guild, the;
T:Stealthy Vipers. A major annoyance, though not a serious threat.;
T:They are in our way though, so we'll beat them sooner or later. But;
T:overall, we don't fear them all that much. All they have is some;
T:poison. We have agility. And polearm mastery. And speed. And more;
T:support from other races too!;
A:Sounds interesting. Can I join the Lancers?:0:0:0:1:4:0:0:0:0

T:Devlings are always welcome in our guild! You want to find our recruitment;
T:office, and speak with Delzo, our leader's representative. He handles;
T:the recruitment of new members. Go speak with him, and I'm sure we'll;
T:have a place for you.;
A:I'll seek him out then.:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

T:Well... I don't know. You're not a devling, and this is supposed to be;
T:a devling guild. But maybe they would allow some exceptions. You should;
T:enter, and speak with Delzo. He will tell you whether or not you can join.;

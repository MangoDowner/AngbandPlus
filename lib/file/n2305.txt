Thunderglow Shots(Active)

Effect: Shoot an Electricity shot, followed by a Light shot.
Damages: Base shot damages.
Radius: Misfortune / 50
Maximum shots: 1
Extra points: +((25% of Misfortune) + 5)% to damages.
              +1 maximum shots every 5 points.

This ability fires a shot of Electricity, followed by a shot of Light. So you
basically get two shots for every extra shots you have. If you increase your
Misfortune, you will get more damages and may also gain radius.

Note that if you have 2 or more maximum shots, all electric shots will be
fired before the light shots. Aborting the electric shots will not prevent
you from firing the light shots.

ABOUT NIGHTMARE ABILITIES:

These abilities are a separate set of abilities that you can learn by defeating
Nightmare Horrors, and using their licialhyds. They do not require ability
points to learn, although they do count toward the total abilities limit.
Each Nightmare Horror has a different ability. You may learn a new ability, or
improve a learned one, once every 3 levels. Both normal races and monsters
may learn these abilities.

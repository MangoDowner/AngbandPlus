T:Heh heh... welcome to the black market, <NAME>! You are surprised;
T:I know you name, huh? You see, as a high-ranked agent of the;
T:Black Market, I have many spies and servants working for me. I know;
T:everything that happens around here. For example, I know you are the;
T:sole survivor of Udor's tragedy. My spies are already working on;
T:finding out who could be behind that... But so far, we haven't found;
T:anything I'm afraid... In any cases, my name is Jordan Shade,;
T:high-ranked agent of the Black Market...;

T:Well well, a new visitor. Welcome to the Black Market, <CLASS>. I'm;
T:Jordan Shade, high ranked agent of the Black Market. We offers the;
T:best quality of goods in Portralis. The prices are heavy, but it's;
T:worth it, I can assure you. Now, if you could tell me your name,;
T:perhaps then, we can discuss... various things...;

T:The Black Market, my friend, is the most misunderstood organization;
T:in Portralis. Peoples thinks we're only a bunch of thieves and assassins...;
T:they think we're an evil organization of criminals! That is a lie, my;
T:friend. We're an organization dedicated to the good of the peoples!;
T:We give peoples what the governement doesn't want them to get. We give;
T:give peoples the information that the governement doesn't want to;
T:reveal...;

T:lies? Shouldn't we all be able to get what we want?;

T:Well, obviously, our agents do not work for free. Also, they must cover;
T:some material costs... and that is all you really need to know.;

T:That gnome's sword? Well, yes, of course. One of my agents;
T:took the sword from him. As you probably noticed, this gnome's an;
T:idiot. However, he somehow managed to get his hands on a very nice,;
T:very sharp short sword of superior quality. This gnome's unworthy;
T:of wielding such a nice blade!;

T:If I understand, he wants his sword back... yet, he doesn't have the;
T:guts to look for it by himself, so he sent you instead. Well... Such;
T:a nice sword is priceless if you ask me... But if you really want;
T:it, I can always sell it back to you... for, let's say, 5000 golds?;
T:I think it's a good price for such a valuable sword. So, are you going;
T:to buy it?;
A:Yes, I'll buy it. [Pay 5000 golds.]:0:0:0:8:5000:9:10:0:0

T:really going to give it back to that gnome, right? I mean, it's such a nice;
T:blade, it would be a waste to let this gnome be the wielder of such;
T:a fine piece of weaponry. Whatever reward he promised you must not be;
T:worth the sword. If I were you, I would just keep it...;

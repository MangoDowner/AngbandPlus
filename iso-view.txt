Iso-UnAngband is work in progress. This release is just a demo
to display the current state of development. There are a whole
lot of images missing and/or not properly assigned. Missing images
will be replaced by colored ASCII letters, wrong assigned images
will shop us as whatever they accidentally were assigned to,
including invisible tiles in the worst case.

Focus of WIP 1 was to have the display code integrated with
UnAngband 0.6.4a, and as much of the terrain done so that one
can walk around hobbtion, the east road, bree and a bit of the
first level of bree sewers.

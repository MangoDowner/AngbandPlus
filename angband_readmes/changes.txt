Angband 3.3.0-wip
=================

We, the Angband development team, are proud to present the latest 
iteration of the game, in the form of Angband 3.3.0-wip. Although this 
version is the conclusion of a lot of work in the 3.2.x series, Angband 
continues to evolve and many further changes are planned (and some are 
in progress). This version is not entirely bug-free but hopefully 
contains no showstoppers. Doubtless there will be another release in a 
few weeks time fixing the bugs found herein, but in the meantime, play.

This release was brought to you by (in alphabetical order of IRC 
nickname): Aerdan, Antony Sidwell, Erik Osheim, Elly, Aaron Bader, 
Lebannen, Chris Carr, William Moore, Robert Au, Peter Denison and 
Andi Sidwell. With special thanks to Eddie Grove for challenging us to 
do better and helping us get there. Please see the file thanks.txt for 
a full list of contributors.

This changelog is complete as of 19 May 2011 (git commit 6d8c346). 
For later changes, see the bug tracker at trac.rephial.org or the 
git logs.

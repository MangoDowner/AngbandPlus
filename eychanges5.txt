## Non-gameplay changes ##

- Optimized monster name routine. (Thanks Kusunose Turo)

## Bug Fixes ##

- Non-uniques with very high life values would be sometimes generated with very
  low hp.

  from unstacks first. (Thanks Kusunose Turo)

- The boots of Thror are no longer cheaper than boots of speed +3 (note that
  in general, artifact/ego item prices still need major rework).

Changes from 0.4.6 to 0.5.0:

## Documentation ##

- Complete updating and expansion of all in-game documentation.

## Non-gameplay changes ##

- Various coding improvements from Angband CVS.

- General code cleanup.

## Gameplay Changes ##

- Character names can now be up to 31 letters long.

- Changed the character display to show the current damage dice; also, the 
  weight carried line shows maximum weight before slow down.

- Limited the maximum size of floor stacks to 23, so that get_item() can
  always display a list containing all objects. (Angband CVS)

- Uniques won't show up as quest monsters before 250'.

- The option to show either traps or objects when both are in the same
  square removed. Instead, there is now an object to show either traps, or 
  a special symbol ('&') which should make these squares easier to notice.

- Many new vault types (mostly from Angband 3.0.1) added.

- If the "display_recharge_msg" option is on, you will also get a message when
  your racial ability (if any) is recharged.

# Birth #

- You now can see your race and class before setting up the autoroller (both
  types). This makes it feasible to use the autorollers with random class
  or race choice.

- Weapons are no longer fixed per class; instead, you get the best weapon 
  possible out of a small list, depending on your stats. Warriors, paladins
  and spellswords get more choices; mystics still begin weaponless.
   
- Minor improvements to quick character generation - the prompt now accepts
  upper-case responses, and if you reject the quick-generated character,
  you are brought into the new character generation screen instead of being
  asked again if you want a quick character.

- You can no longer specify starting ego-items.

# Races #

- Some racial powers slightly modified.

- Racial price adjustments in shops modified a bit.

# Classes #

- Two new class flags: BETTER_BLOWS, WORSE_BLOWS, which affect the amount of
  blows a character gets with his weapon. BETTER_BLOWS is given to warriors,
  WORSE_BLOWS to mages and mystics. All other classes get neither.

- Priest spell selection modified slightly.

- Some bard spells cost a little less mana.

# Magic #

- When learning spells, priests and paladins will no longer recieve spells that
  cost more than their maximum mana.

- New mage spell (in Kelek's) - Hypercharge. It reduces the recharge speed
  for rods and talismans (permanently). You can only hypercharge single items,
  not stacks.

- Many spells toned down to reflect the lowered monster HPs.

- Blight made more powerful.

- Chant/Prayer now each last longer.

- The priest spell "remove fear" replaced by "boldness", which now grants a
  short-term protection from fear (in addition to removing fear).

# Resistances #

- Confusion is no longer a percentile resistance; the NO_CONF flag remains.

# Combat #

- Changed the chance to hit calculation. Now, a to-hit bonus on a weapon
  is a lot more effective. 

- Damage from unarmed combat now depends on your strength (number of blows 
  depends on dexterity).

- Brands/slays effect on damage are now rounded up. This makes them effective 
  even on weapons with small damage dice.

- The penalty for wiedling too-heavy weapons now increased - you also do 
  less damage.

- Plus to damage no longer exists. This involves major repurcussions in items,
  and has major effects as to game balance.

- Bow range is now a factor; arrows may modify the range avaiable. The ranges
  for bows are much shorter than they used to be.

- Bows can now have slays/brands, which are additively cumulative with arrow
  slays/brands.

- Confusion is no longer a damage type - it's only a status affecting attack.

# Items #

- Added new item flag - THROWING. Objects that have this flag do their 
  full damage (as determined in the P: line) when thrown, as before. Objects
  without this flag will do a small amount of damage based on their weight
  when thrown. This is designed to prevent characters from throwing weapons
  with huge damage dice, that they are not strong enough to wield, at monsters.

- Bow tval is now 20; digger tval is now 25; and arrow tval is now 15.

- Increased artifact saving throws to being smashes/blasted.

- "Hafted" weapons are now referred to as "blunt" weapons, a more accurate
  description, given that many polearms are also hafted.

- Rings of resist disease and resist poison now provide immunity to the 
  related effects as well as resistance to the appropriate damage.

- Rings of resist confusion renamed rings of clarity; they no provide NO_CONF,
  rather than (the now obsolete) confusion resistance.

- Potions of neutralize potion and cure disease are now found in both 
  the alchemist's shop and the temple.

- Prefixes work differently. Now, they give a percentile modifier to average 
  damage, and the game tries to give you as similar a weapon to the old one
  that gives the new damage. This means that prefixes remain balanced and
  meaningful for all weapon types. Also, prefixed items may now be of a 
  different material than the base item (affects possible damage from
  monster attacks), and they can affect item depth.

- Prefixes can now alter the color of the prefixed items. Since this can 
  cause some otherwise different items to have similar coloring (for 
  instance, a sapphire hatchet will have the same symbol and color as a 
  drum), it can be turned off by an option (allow_prefix_colors).

- Crossbows, Slings, bolts and shots no longer exist.

- Ego items can also modify damage dice by a percentile value.

- Ego items can now be restricted to base items of a certain material, or 
  weight range.

- Many ego item types changed and added; some removed.

- Many artifact weapons/shooters are now a different base type that they
  used to be.

- Many artifact/item activations powered down to reflect new monster HP 
  levels.

- If a weapon has slays/brands from multiple source (say, prefix and ego-type),
  they are cumulative in an additive way - for example, a hunter's dagger 
  gives x1.2 against animals, a weapon of slay animal gives x1.7 against 
  animals, so a hunter's dagger of slay animal gives x1.9 against animals.

- Talismans of rapid bolts slightly slowed up (from 2 turns to 3 turns).

- If you are wielding an identified bow, 'I'nsepcting arrows will give you
  information about their capabilites.

- The format for displaying + to hit changed. Now, for weapons it appears in 
  the same parantheses as the damage dice - (+1, 1d4). For bows, the display is 
  (+0, x2, 8), where the last number is the bow's range in squares. Arrows are 
  displayed as (+0, 1d4, +0), where the last plus is a range modifier.

- Due to the above change, the SHOW_MODS flag was eliminated.

- Rods/Talismans will *only* recharge when in your inventory. If left on the
  ground, in your home, or sold to a shop, they will remain in their "charging"
  state until you buy/pick them up again.

- Elemental rings no longer give any AC bonus.

- Add new mushroom types: amnesia, cure light wounds, stone skin.

- Mushrooms of weakness/sickliness replaced my mushrooms of stupidity/naivity.

- Cubragol, Sunstrike and Hellwind (both now bows) no longer allow branding of
  arrows; instead, they offer the brands themselves.

- Potions of boldness now grant a short-term protection from fear (in addition to
  removing fear).

# Monsters #

- Monster letters re-organized.
  - 'c'entipedes merged into 'I'nsects.
  - 'f'elines are now 'c'ats.
  - 'F'aeries now split into high level 'F'aeries and low level 'f'aeries.
  - 'H'ags merged into the 'F'aeries. 'H'arpies remain.
  - 'W'raiths/'W'ights mostly renamed into other undead types.
  - 'l'ycanthropes are now 'W'erebeasts.
  - 'p'eople reorganized; there are now 'l'ow level people, medium-level 
    'p'eople, and high-level 'P'eople.

- Many new monsters added, many monsters removed, and many monsters changed. 
  Don't assume anything about monsters just because you know them in another 
  variant (or an older version).

- Since monster HPs have been reduced, increased that amount of damage caused
  by most monster breaths relative to HP so that they still have approximately
  the old damage levels. The caps remain unchanged.

- Changed the way monster hit-points are derived. They no longer have hit dice.
  Instead, they have a life-value, which is the average HP they get, and their
  actual HP are generated within a normal distribution with the life as a mean.
  Uniques always have the exact amount specified by their life rating. As a 
  result, the FORCE_MAXHP flag has been eliminated (yes, this means that all
  non-uniques with more than 1 life have variable HP).

- Monsters in pits, and monster spawned while you're on the level, can now
  be generated asleep.

- Removed the FORCE_SLEEP flag - all monsters now follow this behavior. It was 
  pointless because all monsters for whom it would have made a difference had
  it.

- SMART monsters are less likely to fall asleep after losing sight of you. 
  STUPID monsters are more likely to do so. 

- Since the STUPID and SMART flags affect several things besides spellcasting,
  the monster memory has been changed to reflect this (it now tells you the 
  monster is intelligent, rather than that it casts spells intelligently).

- Rust and rot attacks made more dangerous.

## Bug fixes ##

- Fixed bugs which made uniques on the same base monster be generated in
  order; also, fixed wizard command that summoned named unique (which 
  would generate the wrong unique in the case of multiple ones on the 
  same base). This fix also means that you can now get these uniques as 
  quest monsters.

- Some weirdness could occur when resizing the screen on small levels.

- Monsters that KILL_WALL can no longer destroy quest chests.

- Morgoth and Sauron cannot appear as the quest monster in guild quests.

- Corrected which monsters are "destroyed".

- Fixed bug with monsters being affected by more than one condition at once.

- Fixed bug in squelch menus once you know more than 60 objects of the same 
  type.

- Trapdoors can no longer appear on fixed quest levels.

- Display of charges for stacks of wands used different convention than 
  staves.

- Some deep pit types had incorrect descriptions.

- Various bugfixes from Angband CVS.

- Weapon damage calculations now correctly calculate blows for weapons with
  extra blows.

- Weapon damage calculations now appear in object recall term windows.

- The damage calculation now appears for diggers.

- Poison resistance didn't work correctly in some cases.

- The message verifying leaving quest levels won't appear on special quests.

- The weapon damage calculations no longer spoil un-ID'd items.

- Some strangeness that could arise when selling/destroying rods/talismans
  fixed.

- Fixed display glitch if you get enough EXP to raise you more than one level
  at once.

- Fixed several minor bugs and typos.

HANDS

Prevent a player wielding a weapon, shield, light source and missile
weapon at the same time. Only allow 2 out of 4 of these slots to be
filled at anyone time.

Also allow a 2nd weapon to be wielded in the shield slot provided:
i.	The player gets multiple blows.
ii.	The second weapon is equal to or lighter than the 1st weapon.
Every 2nd blow is taken by the second weapon. They are swapped as per
rings.

If a character is not carrying anything in their hands (no weapon,
shield, missile weapon or light source), they may swim or climb, 
allowing them to ignore water damage or falling into terrain. This
requires a skill test as well for swim or climbing skill as
appropriate, and is heavily penalised by armour.

LIGHTING

Allow monsters, objects, feature to light their location and adjacent
locations.

Have a routine unlit_grid(x,y) that iterates from x-2,y-2 to x+2,y+2,
determining if there is an object, monster or terrain adjacent that can
light the locations ajacent to x,y. Complications due to multiple
objects in a stack, in particular, how do we determine which object,
monster or feature we are removing (Maybe seperate routine for each)
so that it does not get included in the unlit_grid routine. Or do we
remove the item first.

If we drop a torch or lantern from when we are wielding it, we consider
it lit. Should we consider permalit artifacts to always be lit, or only
be lit when we wield them?

Monsters that are GLOWS are always lit. Monsters that are HAVE_LIT have
a radius 1 light. To prevent problems "dragging" light into a room

FOG OF WAR

Make detection spells work on a less than 100% basis. eg 80%-90%. This
way, there can be no way of being exactly sure of whether or not a
secret door is found or trap etc. These can still be detected safely by
using indirect methods, such as a monster opening the door or hitting
the trap.

Maybe do the same for telepathy. Have anti-detection rooms and anti-
telepathy rooms. Also perma-dark rooms, anti-magic rooms etc.

NEW SPELL BOOKS/SPELLS

Defined spells with s_info file including area of effect/range/damage
progression.

In particular, we need generate create an object spells, generate
create a feature spells, generate bolt/beam/ball/wall (Line running
perpendicular to direction chosen)/shield (All adjacent locations)/
flood (Square area) spells. We should also have temporary object spells
which create a wielded object, that may not be unwielded/sold and which
is destroyed when the time out field drops to zero. This allows various
temporary blade spells, Continual Light/Mage Light, Psychic Crown
(Telepathy) and other effects to be generated.

Note all summoned/charmed creatures are set to Betray the caster at the
earliest moment.

Note sleep/slow/confuse/scare spells should be improved in
effectiveness against uniques and other monsters.


MONSTER REVISIONS

Template for each monster genus/kind/race.
Monster races associated with a particular genus/kind (ie Bats, red
dragons) to allow "proper" pits/summon_same, using rg_idx/rk_idx.
Have centralised maintenance for rg_idx/rk_idx list if needed.
Monster r_list editor with attribute inherietence.
Valid flags listed at start of r_info file to confirm parsing.
Unimplemented flags ignored.
Template for monster variables specified at start of r_info file.
Unimplemented variables ignored.

Allow monsters to attack with objects they carry if they hit, and use
objects they carry if they cast spells. 
Allow monsters to have all spells from s_info file.
Allow monsters to target ball spells next to you/not shoot friends with
bolts.
Monsters have IS_LITE, HAS_LITE_1, HAS_LITE_2 flags and NEED_LITE flags,
but this is only used if the option Monsters carry lights is selected.

ROOM DESCRIPTIONS

Specify a d_info file with room descriptions, but not layout. 
Such rooms more commonly generate objects/monsters of a particular flavour.
Some such rooms contain more traps/monsters/objects.
Lots of room descriptions: can be for vaults/unusual shaped rooms as well.
Allow unusually shaped rooms with larger interiors/pillars. 
Allow other shapes of maze rooms (Spiral/maze generators/tessilated). 
Allow larger rooms subdivided into smaller areas. 
Allow wider corridors (2 or 3 width) deep in dungeon, sometimes with pillars 
or lit.

Have rings/wands/staves/wands/potions defined by a base type, with various
flavours for enchanted objects. Magical objects have an activation value
associated with them for magical effects, and are defined just like ego
items for magical weapons/armour. The base type defines the basic value of
the non-magical item, and the activations modify the values, just like ego
weapons.

ie	gold ring	ornate gold ring
			runed gold ring
			plain gold ring


47 gold rings is a treasure, and is useful for its innate value. 1 ornate
gold ring is a magical item.

The activations are define for all possible magical items. Each particular
type defines how the activation is used (ie quaff a potion/read a scroll
etc.). The flavours are seeded differently for each item so that for
instance an ornate gold ring has a different ego value from an ornate
silver ring. However, all ornate gold rings have the same ego type (See
ego flavours below).

Stacking is possible, per ego ammunition.

TREASURE:

All money is defined as an object, rather than abstracted. Copper, silver,
gold, platinum, mithril coins etc. are all denominations used. In addition
there are uncut gems of various types (all mined), nuggets of various
types (All mined), cut gems, jewelry (toe rings, earrings, anklets, ankhs,
amulets, braclets, crowns, etc.), ingots, etc.

The coins of the realm (copper half-pennies and pennies, silver shillings,
gold half-crowns and crowns, pound sterling and pound aurum notes) are
worth more than unknown coins and have a set (old) gold piece value.

			Weight (1/100ths of pound)
half-penny	1 gp		1
penny		2 gp		2
farthing	6 gp		2
shilling	12 gp		4
half-crown	144 gp		3
crown		288 gp		5
pound sterling	300 gp		1
pound aurum	5760 gp		1

The character has a purse, which can contain coins/notes of the realm only
ie it has 8 slots, reserved for each type of coin/note. The purse is accessed
with the $ key while in inventory/equipment or the 'p' key (Old prayer key)
while not in inventory/equipment. The AU value represents the total (set)
value of the purse. It is possible in this system to carry 576,000 gp in one
pound of pound aurum notes (Redeemable for a pound of gold crowns).

Therefore store owners will only trade objects for other objects. If an
object a store owner receives is not sold in their store, they will not
display it as wares, and value it less.  Treasure of various types (eg gold
coins, gold nuggets, diamonds, etc.) will never be sold in a store.

Store owners will offer change in addition to objects, in coins of the realm.

Under this system, haggling is the process of offering additional objects to
reach the agreed value.

FRIENDLY MONSTERS/UNIQUES:

Monsters fight other monsters under the following conditions:

* hostile fights you.
* friendly fight hostile --> hostile fights friendly.
* anybody fights multipy if not the same race and if there are too many
multiply creatures --> if there are too many multiply creatures,
multiply creatures fight those not of the same race
* mindless fight anything not of the same race
* kill_body fights anything that is not the same race --> anybody flees
kill_body if not of the same race or fight if cornered, unless friendly
when they always fight
* good fights evil --> evil fights good
* betrayal monsters fight weak hostile monsters --> weak hostile
monsters fight betrayal monsters

And possibly:
* demons fight animals --> animals flee demons or fight if cornered,
unless friendly when they always fight
* undead fight living if not summon undead --> living, if not summon
undead, flee undead or fight if cornered, unless friendly, when they
always fight

Good monsters are neutral towards you unless marked friendly. Evil
monsters are always hostile, unless marked betrayal. Demonic monsters
are almost always betrayal unless summoned by hostiles. Neither good
nor evil monsters are suspicious. Monsters that surrender because they
cannot flee, become betrayal monsters, as are those marked BETRAYAL.
Summoned monsters are always hostile if summoned by hostile, or BETRAYAL
if summoned by you (Except familiars, which are friendly).

You forget the id of items that a neutral, suspicious or hostile
monster is carrying. However they use the id flag to mark if they know
what the item they are carrying is. This enables them to use/value
items if they are selling them to you.

Friendly uniques (Not pets):

Pippin, Samwise, Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins, Mary, Gandalf, Aragorn,
Gimlee, Legolas etc.

Friendly monsters will give you useful objects that they carry.
Friendly monsters will tell you information about unfriendly monsters
that you encounter. ('Gandalf says "The pseudodragon can breath
light."') Friendly monsters can tell you about monsters that are common
on this level or occur deeper in the dungeon ('Gandalf tells you about
the Dracolich. He says "It can breath nether.") Friendly monsters will
warn you about out of depth monsters that are present on the level.
('Gandalf warns you about the Ancient Multi-Hued Dragon on this level.
He says "It can breath poison."') Monsters that are not smart will warn
you about out of depth monsters, but not be able to tell you what the
monster is, just a general description of it. ('The goblin warns you
about a dangerous monster on this level. He says "It is undead and can
breath nether."').

Friendly monsters tell you about items that you have ('Gandalf says
"The Phial of Gladriel activates to call light.") or out of depth items
or artifacts that occur on this level that you have not found ('Gandalf
tells you about the Power dragon scale mail on this level. He says "It
can resist nether.").

Friendly monsters have useful spells at their disposal ('Gandalf
identifies the silver rod. He says "It is a rod of teleportation."',
'Gandalf heals you', 'Gandalf is surrounded in bright light.' 'Gandalf
casts a spell of monster detection. You sense the presence of
monsters.'). Friendly monsters are never invisible unless you have
betrayed them.

Friendly monsters fight hostile monsters and help other friendly
monsters. When you leave a level, friendly monsters perform one last
action and then depart. Friendly uniques are marked with "You have
encountered..." rather than "You have killed..." when they depart. This
requires that you have seen them on the level first. Friendly uniques
that have become hostile will attempt to leave rather than fight you,
such as by teleporting away, climbing up or down stairs or fleeing.

If you attack a friendly monster or hit it with spells, it becomes
suspicious. It will become hostile if you continue to do so.

Neutral monsters will talk to you to determine your intentions. Neutral
monsters do their own thing. ('The novice mage identifies the silver
rod.'). They may offer to sell you items that they are carrying or
offer you services in return for items or money. If you give them
stuff, they may temporarily help you, but as a rule become suspicious
of you after a while. Neutral monsters fight other monsters if necessary.

Suspicious monsters that are marked friendly may forgive you after a
while. Suspicious monsters try to avoid you by staying out of melee
range (> adjacent).  If you attack, corner or hit neutral / suspicious
monster with spells, it becomes hostile.

Betrayal monsters appear as friendly but they never give you useful
information, help you with magic or give you items, except trivially
('Smeagol tells you about the white worm mass. He says "It crawlsss to
poison".') They will try to rip you off selling you stuff and so on.
Bill Ferny, Wormtongue, Smeagol etc. are typical betrayal monsters.
Typically betrayal monsters use a shortened name (up to the comma) until
they betray you, at which point they use their long name. eg Wormtongue
only becomes the Agent of Saruman after he betrays you.

Betrayal monsters will fight weak monsters, but will betray you once
they have determined your weaknesses or in the presence of tougher
monsters. If attacked, they immediately become hostile.

Guardian monsters act neutral, but become hostile if you try to 
get or open anything in their line of sight.

Stalking monsters flee in line of sight and 

MONSTER SPEECH

Hostile monsters communicate information about you amongst themselves
('The mage says "The human warrior can resist fire.'), and wake others
up, if afraid or attacking you ('The mage yells out in fear.' 'The mage
screams in anger.' 'The mage yells out a warning.') Creatures say, cry
out, yell or scream depending on how much of a threat you are. Some
creatures whisper (undead), moan (undead), howl (dogs), wail (undead),
gibber and so forth.

h,p,t,y,o,etc.	UNDEAD		B		C		F
says		whispers	chirps		growls		purrs
yells out	gibbers		whistles	barks		miaows
cries out	moans		caws		bays		hisses
screams		wails		screeches	howls		catawauls

J,R	R (frogs)	a,I
hisses	croaks		chitters


If you don't understand the language (eg animals/undead) the string is
replaced by 'something' and you are warned you don't understand it.
('The master lich whispers something. You don't understand it.')

Monsters may have particular speech strings. Creatures do not have to
speak to be able to use special strings eg.
V:Miaow!
V:Purrr...
becomes:
The scruffy cat says "Miaow!".

V:Gol-lummm.
V:Where's my preciousss?
V:It hurtsss me!

SAVE FILE INDEPENDENCE
Multiple streams within save files.
Additional options supported/ignored if unimplemented.
Additional entries within each stream supported/ignored if unimplemented.
Vanilla/varient import/export filters.
Multiple levels in save file.
Monsters/items/ego items etc indexed by name/global type rather than order.
Support loading multiple e_info/k_info/r_info files from multiple directories or
selecting different info files at birth.
Security preventing *_info files being modified after birth. 

NEW CLASSES

Use cr_info.txt and cc_info.txt to implement multiple races/classes. This should include
H: lines for history, skill/hit point advancement, shots/blows, attribute modifiers, and 
special attributes gained (eg RES_FEAR) at various levels.
	
Supporting many more special attributes in cr_info that allow more monster races
to be translated to cr_info.txt (eg HURT_LITE, HURT_FIRE, RES_NEXUS etc.)

New classes must be introduced to Angband to expand variety of styles of
play, not unnecessarily. 

THIEF
Thieves should be effective fighters and archers, with the best stealth. They are an
alternate non-spell casting class to the warrior. They are the only class to improve in
stealth and perception and have an excellent pseudo id.

An increased chance of critical hits against sleeping/fleeing monsters should
also not be too imbalancing for thieves (Backstab attack).

A lot of varients attempt to incorporate these changes into rogues. I have them as a seperate
class to test for play balance. To differentiate them, rogues should have improved magic item use.

ARCHER

I have a lot of support for the Archer class, if simply because giving
multiple shots to a Ranger is a big hack. There should be a multiple shots
routine set up just as there is a multiple blows routine, but only up to
4 shots maximum, or things start to get out of hand (Especially with extra
shot artifacts. That and seeker bolts of slay evil=1600+ dam).
Archers should be first on this list, then Warriors and Rangers,
then Mages and Rogues, then Priests (Crossbows were to the medieval clergy
on par with what edged weapons have been traditionally perceived to be).

Archers then become the limited resource attack from a distance style of
play that many people want mages to be.  (ie Shoot multiple times, then
teleport away). They as bad HtH fighters as priests to give
this incentive. Besides which, they can always use their bows rather
than fight in melee. Again, they have a hard early game (Care to run out
of shots, again), although their starting items might benefit (Short bow,
arrows). However they would have the strongest end game except for the GOI.

WARRIOR MAGES

I believe WARRIOR MAGES may be looked at as an effective MAGE equivelent to the PALADIN,
with spell casting from the first level. They are not nearly as good in other skills as
rangers however.

LIGHTING

Allow monsters, objects, feature to light their location and adjacent locations.

Have a routine unlit_grid(x,y) that iterates from x-2,y-2 to x+2,y+2, determining if there is an object, monster or terrain adjacent that can light the locations ajacent to x,y. Complications due to multiple objects in a stack, in particular, how do we determine which object, monster or feature we are removing (Maybe seperate routine for each)
so that it does not get included in the unlit_grid routine. Or do we
remove the item first.

If we drop a torch or lantern from when we are wielding it, we consider it lit. Should we consider permalit artifacts to always be lit, or only be lit when we wield them?

Monsters that are GLOWS are always lit. Monsters that are HAVE_LIT have a radius 1 light. To prevent problems "dragging" light into a room

FOG OF WAR

Make detection spells work on a less than 100% basis. eg 80%-90%. This way, there can be no way of being exactly sure of whether or not a secret door is found or trap etc. These can still be detected safely by using indirect methods, such as a monster opening the door or hitting the trap.


Maybe do the same for telepathy. Have anti-detection rooms and anti-telepathy rooms. Also perma-dark rooms, anti-magic rooms etc.







NEW SPELL BOOKS/SPELLS

Defined spells with s_info file including area of effect/range/damage progression.
Generic routine for determining blow/spell attacks rather than seperate blows and 
spells.

In particular, we need generate create an object spells, generate create a feature spells,
generate bolt/beam/ball/wall (Line running perpendicular to direction chosen)/shield (All
adjacent locations)/flood (Square area) spells. We should also have temporary object
spells which create a wielded object, that may not be unwielded/sold and which is destroyed when
the time out field drops to zero. This allows various temporary blade spells, Continual Light/Mage Light,
Psychic Crown (Telepathy) and other effects to be generated.

Note all summoned/charmed creatures are set to Betray the caster at the earliest
moment.

Note sleep/slow/confuse/scare spells should be improved in effectiveness against uniques and
other monsters.

Reorganise those goddamn spell books. There are lots of good spell ideas
screaming to get in, (Wizard Lock etc.), too many ego books, and not
enough classes able to take advantage of them, so it becomes yet another
cash money item on the dungeon floor when we have enough.

I'd like to see more spells that a character can ever study, if only for some
varied tactics in the mid to end game. This is more organic than the idea
of schools of magic that some varients employ. Either we reduce the number of half-spells
that high level characters can know or provide more books than can be learnt from.
I suggest the latter, with a maximum of 9 books per character to prevent too much diversification. Even this
may be an artificial limit, because books limit the inventory space and somone with too many books can't carry
much else.

Spell books are generated on a theme, such as Magic Book of Fire Spells, or Prayer Book
of Battle Hymns. Books can be generated as (Fireproof) or (Waterproof) or (Theftproof)
which gives the book immunity to damage/loss from that particular sort or (*Special*) which gives immunity to all of the above.

ROOM DESCRIPTIONS

Specify a d_info file with room descriptions, but not layout. 
Such rooms more commonly generate objects/monsters of a particular flavour.
Some such rooms contain more traps/monsters/objects.
Lots of room descriptions: can be for vaults/unusual shaped rooms as well.
Allow unusually shaped rooms with larger interiors/pillars. 
Allow other shapes of maze rooms (Spiral/maze generators/tessilated). 
Allow larger rooms subdivided into smaller areas. 
Allow wider corridors (2 or 3 width) deep in dungeon, sometimes with pillars 
or lit.

OBJECT MEMORY:

Spot if attacked that you have fire/cold/confusion resistance etc. and make best
"guess" as to object providing this ability. eg Ring of Resist Fire? 
Spot if attacking that you have SLAY_ORC/BRAND_FIRE ability if you know enough about monster. 
Spot if you have permalight.
Support multiple types of object per flavour and guess the object based on whether
object flavour has been found eg Potion of Cure Blindness? rather than always known. 
Guess at object flavour if you gain partial benefit rather than never know. eg
Potion of Cure Light Wounds? if no more than light wounds healed.

Object memory should allow the following:

1. You have wielded 6 items and lose strength from an normally resistable attack. This clearly means none of these items sustain strength.

2. You have wielded 6 items and notice that you sustain strength. You take off each item in turn, testing that you still possess this ability, until you notice that you lose this ability after removing an item. This item clearly provides this ability.

3. You have wielded 3 new items over the course of a period of adventuring. You then notice that you sustain strength, which you previously did not do. Then clearly, one or more items may sustain strength (In fact, at least 1 of these three must do).

4. This should also apply to attacks which deliver known elemental damage, which either exceeded 1/3 of maximum damage (no resistance) or deliver less than 1/3 of minimum damage (resistance).

5. This should also apply to feather fall, regeneration (after a number of turns of damage), free action, see invisible etc.

For 6 & 7, we assume we can determine the damage done by the weapon. Either because we are assumed 'good' enough, or because we have killed enough creatures, or because we have killed enough creatures and the monster health bar is affected appropriately. If we make the third assumption, then in order for 7 to apply, we have to kill a creature in less than the minimum number of blows normally required. This is hard to track. I prefer option 2 because it allows for fast detects while fighting with the weapon against known creatures.

6. For attacks, if we deliver low damage (less than 3x minimum damage) we know that the weapon does NOT_ have slays for the type of creature, and NOT_ brands for anything that creature is hurt by. This requires we know the weapon is not cursed, and so don't include bonus damage in the expected minimum damage, or that we have identified the weapon and can include bonuses. If we are wearing cursed items, we don't know minimums (as our stats may be reduced) and so can't perform this step.

7. When you deliver very high (exceeds maximum) damage and attempt to guess from what you know of the creature you are fighting, what the source of the high damage might be. This means an item MAY_ slay a particular race (depending on what races an creature belongs to) and MAY_ brand a particular element (depending on what resistances/hurts a creature has). We can limit this to Execute Dragon and the brands for which we know a creature is hurt by if we deliver greater than 3 times damage. We include the highest allowed strength in our maximum damage calculation, because we don't know our real strength, and require that the weapon is at least identified (Otherwise we don't know its damage bonus), along with our rings and gauntlets. If all items we wear are identified and HAS_ strength bonus, or NOT_ strength bonus, then we can use our real strength in this calculation.
If we restrict the possible brands by a creature being IMMUNE to all the brands except for those the weapon does NOT possess, and restrict the slays so that there is only one the creature belongs to except for those that the weapon does NOT possess, then clearly the weapon HAS that slay.
Similiarly, if the weapon does NOT slay the races to which the creature belongs, and the creature is IMMUNE to all brands except for one other than those the weapon does NOT possess, then clearly the weapon the weapon HAS the excepted brand.
Similiarly, if the creature is a dragon and > 3x max damage is delivered, and the creature is IMMUNE to all the brands except those that the weapon does NOT have, then the weapon is EXECUTE dragon.
Similiarly, if the creature is not a dragon and > 3x max damage is delivered, and the creature is IMMUNE to all brands except one and those that the weapon does NOT have, then the weapon HAS that one brand.

8. Trivially permanent light, extra blows/attacks, cursed should be noticed and memorised.


The following rules are useful:
When wielded, object is marked with NOT_CURSED, NOT_HEAVY_CURSED etc. unless cursed. Then, mark with HAS_CURSED. If {average} or identified non-ego/non-artifact item, memorise KIDX with NOT_ if not cursed, unless MAY or HAS in which case memorise with MAY_. Similarly for cursed items, identified ego items and identified artifacts.

When notices does not have ability, all objects wielded are marked with NOT_ flag and this is memorised for K_IDX (or flavour if flavoured and unidentified) and identified ARTIFACT items. Identified EGO items are memorised with NOT_ unless they are already memorised with HAS_ or MAY_ in which case this is replaced by MAY_.

When notices has ability, all objects wielded marked with MAY_ flag, unless an {average} or identified non-ego/non-artifact KIDX (or flavour if flavoured and unidentified) marked with NOT_ flag, or identified artifact marked with NOT_ flag. If this leaves only one item, then item is marked with HAS_ flag instead, which marks an identified artifact with HAS_ if the KIDX (or flavour if flavoured and unidentified) is marked with NOT_, or marks an identified non-ego/non-artifact or {average} KIDX (or flavour if flavoured and unidentified) marked with HAS_ flag, or marks an identified ego item or artifact with HAS_ if the KIDX (or flavour if flavoured and unidentified) is marked with NOT_, unless the identified ego item is NOT_ or MAY_ in which case it is rememorised with MAY_ and marked with HAS_.

When identified, if non-ego/non-artifact, KIDX is memorised with HAS_ if object (or flavour) is marked with HAS_. If artifact and marked with HAS_, and KIDX is memorised with NOT_, then memorise artifact with HAS_. If ego item and marked with HAS_, and KIDX is memorised with NOT_ then memorise ego item with HAS_ unless ego item is memorised with NOT_ or MAY_. In this case, memorise as MAY_.

Memorise what MAY_ flags have been learned until an object is wielded or taken off. If an object is wielded, forget learned or put aside MAY_ flags, except MAY_ flags where object is identified or {average} has matching KIDX NOT_ flags, or object is identified artifact with matching KIDX NOT_ flags and artifact NOT_ flags. If object is taken off, put aside MAY flags_ that are learned and mark object as put-aside. If a second object is taken off, get rid of this put aside information. However, if put-aside MAY_ flags exist, and it is noticed that the ability is no longer present, mark the put-aside object with a HAS_ flag instead.
If a wielded or put aside item is identified and learned or put-aside flags exist, remove those objects from contention on the learned or put aside list, if it then becomes known that the object does NOT_ have the property, via KIDX and/or artifact as appropriate. Then if there exists only 1 remaining object that can contend (either the put aside object or a wielded object) for a flag on the list, then mark that object as HAS_ that ability.

When marked with HAS_ flag or MAY_, attempts to match an object to an EGO item or ARTIFACT in memory, guessing as to which item matches most closely for flags, and ending guess with '?' (or '??' with MAY_), and marking flavour_guess with the item if the item is flavoured.

Flavours are unmemorised at death. All KIDX, ego and artifacts memory is persistant.

With wands, potions, scrolls, rods, staves, attempt to guess item if not determined by effects applied from partial effects applied. ie if 8 damage healed, will guess Cure Light Wounds? unless Cure Light Wounds flavour already known in which case guess Cure Serious Wounds? etc. If effect not determined, guess ('??') from those items that have unknown effects based on the result ie aimed at wall, not monster, and no obvious result, guess Wand of Slow Monster?? unless Slow Monster flavour already known etc. Guess {empty/charging} if all Wand/Rod/Staff KIDX are known this game. Must have KIDX in memory, and effects result from successful usage also in memory. Because of Wands of Wonder, any effect that potentially could be a Wand of Wonder is also guessed. ie Wand of Transmute Rock to Mud?

Also get {good}/{cursed} feelings about scrolls, wands, potions, staves, rods if mage, priest, rogue.

Once object memory is working, we may modify *IDENTIFY*'s powers somewhat, may be to provide an additional *LEGEND LORE* item, with the old identify's powers, and let *IDENTIFY* only pick 1 ability, or make Identify itself a lot less available.

ALGORITHMIC MONSTER LEVEL:

We determine the resistances/powers held from objects available at a particular depth. 
This allows us to compute MAX_DAMAGE, which is maximum damage applied in a single player action (ie highest of MAX_MELEE DAMAGE * SPEED and MAX_SPELL_DAMAGE * SPEED / CHANCE and MAX_SPELL_DAMAGE), AVG_DAMAGE, which is the average damage applied per round (ie ((MAX_MELEE DAMAGE * SPEED * CHANCE-1)  + MAX_SPELL DAMAGE * SPEED) / CHANCE).

Therefore what is important is two things: MAX_DAMAGE which is determines the minimum player hit points required to encounter the monster, and AVG_DAMAGE * TKK which is the player hit points required to kill the monster.

In addition, special abilities have a minimum level assigned to them, based on the level at which objects appear providing resistance to the effect in question.

We then give a rough estimate of player hit points, damage, speed, tactics, and monster friends. This allows us to determine how quickly a player may kill a monster (ie speed -10 + tactics + no friends + low level == very easily) which times its AVG_DAMAGE gives the minimum player hit points required at the level to allow that monster. Note that we assume healing capacity as well (ie Cure Light Wounds etc.) which adds to player hit points when available, and Teleportation, which doubles player hit points when available.

We also use MAX_DAMAGE as a threat assessment. If a player can be dropped below 50% hit points by MAX_DAMAGE the monster needs to be made deeper, or 80% with friends.


FRIENDLY MONSTERS/UNIQUES:

Monsters fight other monsters under the following conditions:

* hostile fights you.
* friendly fight hostile --> hostile fights friendly.
* anybody fights multipy if not the same race and if there are too many multiply creatures --> if there are too many multiply creatures, multiply creatures fight those not of the same race
* mindless fight anything not of the same race
* kill_body fights anything that is not the same race --> anybody flees kill_body if not of the same race or fight if cornered, unless friendly when they always fight
* undead fight living if not summon undead --> living if not summon undead flee undead or fight if cornered, unless friendly, when they always fight
* good fights evil --> evil fights good
* betrayal monsters fight weak hostile monsters --> weak hostile monsters fight betrayal monsters
* demons fight animals --> animals flee demons or fight if cornered, unless friendly when they always fight

Good monsters are neutral towards you unless marked friendly. Evil monsters are always hostile, unless marked betrayal. Demonic monsters are almost always betrayal unless summoned. Neither good nor evil monsters are suspicious. Monsters that surrender because they cannot flee, become betrayal monsters, as are those marked BETRAYAL. Summoned monsters are always hostile if summoned by hostile, or BETRAYAL if summoned by you (Except familiars, which are friendly).

You forget the id of items that a neutral, suspicious or hostile monster is carrying. However they use the id flag to mark if they know what the item they are carrying is. This enables them to use/value items if they are selling them to you.

Friendly uniques (Not pets):

Pippin, Samwise, Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins, Mary, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimlee, Legolas etc.

Friendly monsters will give you useful objects that they carry. Friendly monsters will tell you information about unfriendly monsters that you encounter. ('Gandalf says "The pseudodragon can breath light."') Friendly monsters can tell you about monsters that are common on this level or occur deeper in the dungeon ('Gandalf tells you about the Dracolich. He says "It can breath nether.") Friendly monsters will warn you about out of depth monsters that are present on the level. ('Gandalf warns you about the Ancient Multi-Hued Dragon on this level. He says "It can breath poison."') Monsters that are not smart will warn you about out of depth monsters, but not be able to tell you what the monster is, just a general description of it. ('The goblin warns you about a dangerous monster on this level. He says "It is undead and can breath nether."').

Friendly monsters tell you about items that you have ('Gandalf says "The Phial of Gladriel activates to call light.") or out of depth items or artifacts that occur on this level that you have not found ('Gandalf tells you about the Power dragon scale mail on this level. He says "It can resist nether.").

Friendly monsters have useful spells at their disposal ('Gandalf identifies the silver rod. He says "It is a rod of teleportation."', 'Gandalf heals you', 'Gandalf is surrounded in bright light.' 'Gandalf casts a spell of monster detection. You sense the presence of monsters.'). Friendly monsters are never invisible unless you have betrayed them.

Friendly monsters fight hostile monsters and help other friendly monsters. When you leave a level, friendly monsters perform one last action and then depart. Friendly uniques are marked with "You have encountered..." rather than "You have killed..." when they depart. This requires that you have seen them on the level first. Friendly uniques that have become hostile will attempt to leave rather than fight you, such as by teleporting away, climbing up or down stairs or fleeing.

If you attack a friendly monster or hit it with spells, it becomes suspicious.

Neutral monsters will talk to you to determine your intentions. Neutral monsters do their own thing. ('The novice mage identifies the silver rod.'). They may offer to sell you items that they are carrying or offer you services in return for items or money. If you give them stuff, they may temporarily help you, but as a rule become suspicious of you after a while. Neutral monsters fight other monsters if necessary.

Suspicious monsters that are marked friendly may forgive you after a while. Suspicious monsters try to avoid you by staying out of melee range (> adjacent).  If you attack, corner or hit neutral / suspicious monster with spells, it becomes hostile.

Betrayal monsters appear as friendly but they never give you useful information, help you with magic or give you items, except trivially ('Smeagol tells you about the white worm mass. He says "It crawlsss to poison".') They will try to rip you off selling you stuff and so on.
Bill Ferny, Wormtongue, Smeagol etc. are typical betrayal monsters. Typically betrayal monsters use a shortened name (up to the comma) until they betray you, at which point they use their long name. eg Wormtongue only becomes the Agent of Saruman after he betrays you.

Betrayal monsters will fight weak monsters, but will betray you once they have determined your weaknesses or in the presence of tougher monsters. If attacked, they immediately become hostile.

MONSTER SPEECH

Hostile monsters communicate information about you amongst themselves ('The mage says "The human warrior can resist fire.'), and wake others up, if afraid or attacking you ('The mage yells out in fear.' 'The mage screams in anger.' 'The mage yells out a warning.') Creatures say, cry out, yell or scream depending on how much of a threat you are. Some creatures whisper (undead), moan (undead), howl (dogs), wail (undead), gibber and so forth.

h,p,t,y,o,etc.	UNDEAD		B		C		F		J,R
says		whispers	chirps		growls		purrs		hisses
yells out	gibbers		whistles	barks		miaows		hisses
cries out	moans		caws		bays		hisses		hisses
screams		wails		screeches	howls		catawauls	hisses

If you don't understand the language (eg animals/undead) the string is replaced by 'something' and you are warned you don't understand it. ('The master lich whispers something. You don't understand it.')

L: is language transformation. Strings of form 'before' are transformed to ->'after' when spoken by the creature. A space after may also be punctuation.
V: Gives special strings said by the creature, such as part of an attack or at random. These are already transformed.

eg Smeagol.
L:"s "->"sss "
V:Where'sss my preciousss?
V:It hurtsss me.

eg sibillance
L:"str"->"thw":"st"->"thw":"s"->"th"
V:The human warrior can thuthwain thwength.
V:Thay it aint tho.
V:Thuppothedly, he thaid that Thammy thingth thwell.

eg bad European accent.
L:" wha"->" vo":" wh"->" v":" w"->" v":"ve "->"ff ":"ing "->"ink ":" s"->" z":" zt"->" st"
V:Vot are you doink?
V:Ve haff vays of makink you talk.
V:Hogan!!!!!
V:Do you haff the strength to do this?

Creatures do not have to speak to be able to use special strings eg.
V:Miaow!
V:Purrr...
becomes:
The scruffy cat says "Miaow!".

none known at the moment leading to crashes or hanging sessions.

There have been reports of the game not running smoothly over the lib/
directory of an older version ('nothing' objects appearing, junk with
random plusses and bonusses in shops, crashes on saving). Please empty
the lib/ directory and re-extract the lib/ directory from the archive
if you think this is happening to you!

other bugs are known as starting-points for improvements in the logical
behaviour :-)

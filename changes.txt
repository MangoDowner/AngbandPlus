SAngband 0.9.4g (changes by Gumby [17-Feb-2002]):
1) All items and spells that should detect stairs as well as doors now do
so.
2) Detect Doors now shows all doors, even those that are locked or jammed.
3) Added option to show the damage dealt by the player in melee and missile
combat. [taken from Gumband]
4) Current XP is now displayed on the skills screen.
5) Altered the colour scheme of dungeon features to match that of Gumband.
6) Chunks of ore are now the same colour as coins/armour of the appropriate
type (the exception being Crystal, which I decided to make white).
7) Weapons, armours, light sources, rings and amulets can now stack if they
pseudo-ID as {average}. [taken from Gumband, based on an idea and code by
Antimatter of #angband on IRC]
8) Altered the fenneling lack-of-skill messages for wands and staves to
tell the player more explicitly which skill needs to be improved.
9) Set the maximum pval for fenneled items to 10 in all cases, the exception
being extra blows (capped at +5). [stats can still be gross, however :]
10) Replaced do_cmd_spike() with the appropriate functions from SAngband
0.9.5, mainly to fix the Reinforce Door item-trashing bug.
11) Scrolls of *Identify* can now be found in the Alchemy Shop.
12) Changed the Bow-making prompt to show you '(Q)uarrels' (bolts) instead
of '(S)hots', which was misleading.
13) When forging a bow, weapon, or piece of armour, it will be created
Identified.  A randint(250) <= Int check is then made.  If the check passes,
then the new item will be *Identified*.
14) Evened out the costs and levels of spellbooks so that no realm has an
advantage in that area over the others, and recolored them so that they
match the Gumband color scheme. [Sorcery is light blue/blue, Priestly is
'light' white (slightly darker than scrolls), Druidic/Nature is light
green/green, and Necromancy is 'light' dark/violet]
15) The detect_general() function in spells2.c wasn't working properly [eg,
showing undead creatures when you only want non-undead], so I replaced it
with the more traditional detect_evil() [Gumband version] and cloned that
function for detect_undead(), detect_life() and detect_animals(). [first
tried importing the SAng095 version of those functions, but they also didn't
work properly]
16) Added messages to the various Remove Curse spells to tell you if the
spell actually did anything.  Added one to Scrolls of *Remove Curse* as
well.
17) I *think* the fenneling bug that sometimes destroys the wrong item is
fixed, thanks to pointers from Julian.  At least I haven't been able to
cause an explosion yet.  Testing will continue.
18) Altered the Necromantic spell 'Curse Weapon' slightly so that the
message telling you the weapon has been cursed successfully comes *before*
the (+2,+2) enchantment has a chance to break the curse.
19) Added code (provided for Gumband by Riivo Magi) to filter out already
identified or *identified* items when prompted to select an item to ID or
*ID*.
20) Pink Elephants are now actually pink and are 'q'uadropeds.
21) BUG: I *would* have enabled the generation of spoilers from within the
game [" at the debug command prompt], but for some reason I haven't been
able to track down, the attributes based on object flags (slays and such) of
artifacts are not generated along with their names, visible stats, weight,
cost, etc...
22) You can now <b>rowse a spellbook (in your inventory) while in a shop
instead of getting a "You cannot see!" message.
23) *Destruction* and Earthquake no longer cause you to forget the grids in
the affected area (from Gumband).
24) When forging items, items created with bonuses to your stats, stealth,
infravision, searching, tunneling, speed, or blows will no longer be made
with +0 pval.
25) Added a "No query to destroy known worthless items" option. [defaults to
FALSE.]
26) Nature and Necromancy books will now burn like Magic and Prayer books
do, and since scrolls and staves are destroyed by acid, so are spellbooks.
Components will also melt due to fire (except for Adamant, Mithril and
Crystal, which now have IGNORE_FIRE).
27) Moved the display of Gold on the character sheet up to below Social
Class. Added the display of both your current depth and your maximum depth
to the character sheet.
28) Necromancy's and Sorcery's 'Regain Mana' spells and Nature's 'Regain
Harmony' spell now will always restore the amount of mana spent on the spell
(meaning you really only pay, if the spell doesn't fail, by using up a
possible move/attack) plus a random amount, instead of just a random amount.
[note that since your mana is reduced from casting a spell *after* the spell
takes effect, casting this when you have full or near full mana is rather
pointless]
29) Rods and other objects now show how many turns they have until they are
recharged.
30) Corrected a spelling error: 'Sustinence' is now the proper 'Sustenance'.
31) Modified ./lib/user/pref.prf (remove the ` macro if compiling for Linux)
to conform to my normal preferences, and added necro.prf, wizard.prf,
priest.prf and druid.prf, which contain spell macros that will be loaded
automatically when you restore a character with the appropriate realm of
magic.
32) The Wizardry 'Mana Bolt' and 'Magic Storm' spells now do reasonable
amounts of damage, as does 'Lightning Ball'. Necromancy's 'Disrupt Life' and
'Drain Life' have also increased their damages slightly.

SAngband 0.9.4:
1) Hellfire now updates the fear indicator correctly.
2) Dispel * effects now only work on the appropriate type of critter,
as does Slow Undead.
3) The player no longer move at double speed. (Fix by Greg Wooledge.)
4) The 'C' screen should no longer crash the game. (Fix by Greg
Wooledge.)
5) The player no longer forgets spells they've recently learned.
6) *Identify*, Self Knowledge, and monster memory now know about
all the new flags.
7) Artifacts now appear with proper rarity.
8) Skullcleaver now has an activation.
9) Poisonous weapons work correctly.
10) Resistance to weapon types works correctly.
11) Ego items get their random abilities.
12) Objects stacking on floor works.
13) Combat damage has been reorganized, and the potential for absurd
amounts of damage has been scaled back significantly.
14) Making wands, staves, potions, and scrolls can now produce useful
objects.
15) A number of bugs involving scrolls of questing have been fixed.
16) Holy Defender weapons no longer have strange penalties.
17) The Dual Wield skill should now work. (Loosly based on a patch
by Brian Pope <brpope@terra.geology.indiana.edu>.)
18) For game balance reasons, weapons providing extra attacks give no
more than two.
19) The documentation has been brought a bit more up to date.
20) The spell info has been cleaned up.
21) The shapechanging code has been re-written.
22) Iron will has been toned down.
23) Fenneling has been partially re-written and (hopefully)
made more balanced.
24) The 'C' screen now knows about Giant and Dark Elf intrinsics.
(fix by Jens Gislev.)
25) Teleportation no longer has the potential to lock up the game.
(fix by Jens Gislev.)
26) What abilities are available on which forged objects has been
slightly reorganized.
27) A few things in the various info.txt files have been changed.
28) Predict weather works a lot better now, and the weather code
has been modified slightly.
29) A potential crash involving objects with very long names has been
dealt with.
30) A number of cosmetic problems have been cleaned up.

SAngband 0.9.3 (04/04/97):
1) "Mystic" weapons should now work.
2) Priest spells are matched correctly.  Also, the "elemental brand" prayer
will properly brand weapons.
3) Luck cannot be minimized with the autoroller and is not displayed until
the player casts self-knowledge.  Players no longer become extremely lucky
by going back to a previous character.
4) Weapons with "venom" now work correctly.
5) Self-knowledge has been fixed to display all flags.
6) The player's "spell level" is calculated differently so that it cannot be
higher than 50.  The "teleport" prayer should not lock up the game.
7) Serpentine weapons are no longer vorpal (I had them erroneously defined
as being the same :).)  Weapons that were vorpal in v0.8.9 are once again
vorpal.
8) No more cursed "holy avenger" boots (oops...)
9) The screen should always withdraw from the talent screen.
10) Angband 2.8.0 -> 2.8.1 changes apply.
11) There is now a maximum speed of +70.  (A player reported getting his
speed higher than this and losing the ability to move, so I have put in a
max.)
12) No more "Bootses" or "Gauntletses" when forged boots or gloves stack.

SAngband 0.9.2 (01/25/97):
1) The "spiritual hammer" prayer now works correctly.
2) To-dam modifiers of weapons now work.
3) A number of cosmetic things have been fixed (the spell info is correct
for all few more spells, the word "Invisible" is now taken off the screen
when the player is no longer invisible, etc.)
4) All races, except humans, dunedain, and high-elves get much less "life
experience" when starting out.
5) Fixed a bug which would cause the player to start out with a large amount
of negative exp if the total of his stat mods were negative.

SAngband 0.9.1 (01/11/97):
1) The cursor is now moved properly when choosing stat modifiers.
2) Weaponsmithing, armor forging, bowmaking, and fennling all work
correctly.  Bowmaking will never create a seeker arrow when a bow is
requested.  Forged/fennled items no longer lose their properties when the
game is saved.
3) The necro "Infuse Weapon" and "Curse Weapon" spells no longer work on
artifacts.  "Curse Weapon" now works correctly.
4) Fixed a bug which caused some spells not to take a turn if they had no
effect on the player (eg, casting Curse Weapon on a weapon that was already
cursed).
5) Fixed the bug which caused Morgoth not to exist (so you can actually win
the game...)
6) V0.9.0 would erroneously flag all priest, druid, and necro spells as
being untried.  Fixed.
7) "Nothing" items no longer appear in the temple.  (I'm not exactly sure
why they were appearing, actually, but they will no longer appear.)
8) "Recall()" is now called "recall_player()" to avoid conflicting with the
recall variables in some term packages (Acorn, Amiga, X11, Xaw).  Thanks to
Greg Wooledge (wooledge@kellnet.com) for pointing this out.
9) Special druid and necro books are now considered "good" (treated as
special magic and prayer books are).
10) The spell info (which is displayed when browsing books, etc) is now
correct.
11) The amount of weight that the player is carrying is now updated properly
when altering the number of objects in a stack with wizard mode.
12) See invisible now works.
13) Hellfire does less damage now.  Monsters that appear in groups no longer
cast it.  ALso, this attack is now described as a spell rather than a
breath.

11/26/05 - 
Changes in Animeband 0.6.0
- Switch to Cygwin/GCC instead of VC++.  Source changed somewhat so that it compiles in Cygwin GCC.
- Chuukei patch added.  Now you can have people watch you play, or watch other people play.  
  Currently there are no servers for non-Japanese players, however, if someone is willing to host 
  one, download this: http://gridbug.dyndns.org/broadcastd.tar.gz and e-mail me. (Habu, iks, Shun, PhaethonH)
- Movie playback and record feature available.  Saves in the lib/user directory as an amv 
  file.  Records about 10 minutes per meg.  Thanks to iks for this wonderful feature.
- Fixed version number
- Fixed dash and pyrotechnics crash
- Fixed Sand glitch.  Sand was only doing 1/6th damage instead of 2/3rds. (Deliverything)
- Fixed Wizard mode damage display glitch; was displaying wrong numbers (Deliverything)
- Replacement Technique will now only work 25% of the time for the player.
- Armor of Sand only blocks attacks 25% of the time.
- Moon the Cat no longer sits there like an idiot (Henkma)
- Last boss changed from Neo to Raoh (Hokuto no Ken)
- Lupin now has replacement technique.  Color changed to red.
- Fixed Umbrella of Eagle and other artifact oddities
- A few monster name oddities fixed (natsukemono).
- Taunt and Pose glitch crash glitch fixed (??)  Also, taunt and pose speed glitch fixed.  Possibly the same?
- Fixed rather silly Sanjiyan Sand glitch.
- Replacement Technique for monsters forces monsters to wake up.
- Testing: XAngband Style status bar and level feeling (MarRabbit, iks)
- Testing: Naive solution to the so-called "Too Much Junk" problem.  Gold is dropped most of the time; 
  presumption that whatever player needs is in Black Market.  Black Market just hands you the item now.
  The too_much_junk option changes the distribution to normal if shut off.  Default is off.
- Number of creatures with ONLY_ITEM flag severely reduced.  
- Testing: Hastily modified char dump to output resistances and sustains
- Fixed odd spellbook bug (Henkma)
- Fixed Rasengan bug (sorta).  At least it doesn't crash. (p_ouji)
- Made Randart exceptions to Triumph and Perseverence.
- Testing: Tsukuyomi now does stuff.
- Fixed mimicing glitch. (p_ouji)
- Fixed negative mana glitch, I think (p_ouji)
- Fixed odd Sharingan/Byakugan glitch where it doesn't dissipate despite zero mana.
- Testing: XAngband targeting system (iks).
- Fixed negative meter gain Sand Glitch (p_ouji)


Need to do (priority wise):
- AI system - The HENKMA/P_OUJI KILLER
- Takkaria stacking patch
- Change Randart names - use the JHengband method
- Genjutsu
- Mecha shop
- Hyakuretsu ken
- Hokuto/Nanto attack

10/14/05 - 11/26/05 
Changes in Animeband 0.5.9.1
- Timing changed to remove movement clumping based on a modification of Kornelis' solution, 
  only this should cover all cases.  Thanks to Vaevictus for doing an algorithm analysis 
  on my variation to ensure that it works :).
- Fixed "Umbrella of Axl-Low" glitch and other amusing artifact oddities
- Fixed mecha weight glitch for sentai. Also made the mecha summoned have a minimum of 
  2500 HP.
- Sentai can no longer taunt/pose level one creatures.
- New artifacts and monsters.
- Drain mana removed from mimicing for now (it didn't do anything anyways).

To do: Kiosk instead of Delivery boy (Calamarain), placed within 10 DLs above max depth.

  Someone may want to suggest better letters here.

  monster.
- Super Punch from Chi Warrior now sends them flying 13 spaces on average instead of 5.
  Induced Stun reduced by half.  Renamed to Shinkansen (because you hit like a train ^_^).
- Warriors given STUN_HANDS flag.  Warrior hits will now induce stun on good or better hits.  Warriors 
  start with Katanas instead of Broadswords.

  just like a tactical nuke would.

	- +1 STR, +2 INT, -3 WIS, +4 DEX, +2 CON, -2 CHR

	- Extra shot flag given

	- Use Costumes to mimic creatures.  Costumes are created by using the 'U' key.  
	  Costs 100 meter to alter new Costume (default is set to "Odd Clothes")
	- Costumes are sellable (General, Armory)
	- Costumes appear in the General Store.
	- While wearing a costume, you mimic the creature of that costume.  Mimic requires
	  no upkeep (FREE_MIMIC)  Mimic powers cost meter, however.

	- Cosplayers have MECHA_SENSE (reduced damage while riding a Mecha, including zero 
          damage from 1 damage attacks)
	- Weak Psuedo-ID
	- Analyze works just like probing: tells you all of the monster's resistances, melee attacks 
	  and other stuff.

- Priest prayers sometimes cost no mana (player level dependent random event, done by INTERVENTION flag)
- Warning message now given if you're close to being drunk, and also when you're close to being sober.
- You can now request items from the black market.  Only one type of item 
  (though you can request multiple items), and it'll be delivered to you.  Will cost 100% extra of black market price.
  You can only have one delivery at a time, and you cannot request another item until delivery succeeds 
  or fails. Max 20 of an item per request (to avoid stupid overflow errors).  Incidentally, this code is so 
  ugly that sometimes I wake up and cry at night thinking about it...
- Broadsword of Perseverance and Quarterstaff of Triumph weight restored to 050 weights + 75 pounds to make it very difficult 
  to abuse.  Upped the unwanted summoning chance from 5% to 20%.  Induces Teleportation randomly.
- New artifacts replacing all of the stupid ones.

  they're very useful.

Changes in Animeband 0.5.5:
- A VERY bad Magic Knight glitch fixed (if you hit level 50, weapon turns 
  into an umbrella.  Woo-hoo.  This won't happen anymore :))
- Magic Knights nerfed a bit.  I felt that they were too strong.
- Some people may have gotten an old changes.txt file.  In that case ignore
  the part about the Magic Knights.  The dice/sides DO evolve.
- Chi Warrior Powers finally correctly implemented.  I also nerfed them 
  a lot because they seem severely unbalanced.  They can't cook well
  either or wield shields.  Oh well, only time will tell.
- Mimics nerfed slightly.
- Some monsters can "blade catch" you.  MWAHAHAHAHA!
- Reduced required quests from 4 to just 2.  You must solve two quests
  and kill Lina for the stairs to appear to DL 100, if you're in quest
  mode.  Currently there are only 6 quests available..of course, this
  will change eventually.
- On the plus side, there's a new scroll called "Life Insurance".  Maybe 
  this will make the game a lot easier.
- Some new, most evil monsters :)
- Some new vaults

Todo:
- Use flags more often instead of ghetto code :)
- Implement a most evil AI....hopefully it'll be nastier than 4GAI.

  Had some odd trouble with this.

  just level up to the next 10n, and it'll be fixed from there.
- Sanjiyan new limit break: Raging Demon
- Bullets do a lot more damage (from people who shoot guns)
- Some new monsters
- Fixed a metal/mecha glitch
- Wrote a wilderness maker that combines the graph-like properties
  of Un with the customizability of ToME.  I had fun with this one ^_^

  left of the town.  It costs 300 AU to board the train.
- Mechas no longer lose life for firing guns
- Mecha HP replaces player HP on the screen when you wield a mecha.
- New classes, Mimic and Chi Warrior.  Mimics can mimic whatever 
  monster is adjacent to them with the 'O' key.  Chi Warriors are 
  not allowed to use weapons, but get a punch bonus, and learn powers
  from parchments.  Once a power is learned, it can be swapped into 
  your knowledge queue for use at any time.
- Limit Break command changed to 'p'

- New command: Press CTRL-B to give an item to someone.
- New command: Press CTRL-H to cook items.

  Quest mode for people who like quests.  If you use an old version 
  savefile, it will default to Classical.
- Mecha repair scrolls are available.  However, they weigh 500 pounds.
  :)

Todo:
- Make some of the mimic powers less retarded
- Monster mana....anyone?
- Sort out the terrains and object list (get rid of that stupid "pit"
  glitch)
- Remap the controls so they're more intuitive (need to look at 
  the roguelike keyset)

- Fixed *really* abusable Student glitch, so now Student transform is no longer instant.

  dependent.
- Magic Knights toned down just slightly (probably not noticeable)
- Sky Dragon Student and Magic Knight glitch fixed.  The exp needed to level up is now 
  correct.
- Black Market may sell some strange food stuffs.  That is fine.  It will be part of an

  (or "super", whatever you want to call it).  Such supers are dependent on what race you are
  and usually have good effects.  When you have maximum meter, press 'Z' to super.
- A new fighting style system is implemented.  The groove system affects how you gain meter along with
  some other things (critical hits, dodges, parrys, etc.)
- You can get drunk in this game :))  Though, the effects aren't exactly good.
- Some uniques never die.
- Some monsters will hit you, regardless of what armor you're wearing.  There are monsters out
  there which I suggest you run from...

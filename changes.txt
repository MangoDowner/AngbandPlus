T.o.M.E. 1.0.0 changes

Interface changes:
- Incorporated the hopefully improved running code from the CVS version.
  It uses CAN_RUN and DONT_NOTICE_RUNNING flags for non-conditional
  checks (i.e. not controlled by the disturbance flags or requiring
  immunity), so that most running problem can be fixed by editing
  f_info.txt -- pelpel
- Inven/equip/item choice in subwindows now clears to the bottom of screen,
  to avoid glitches and in accordance with the way it worked -- pelpel
- Identify and *Identify* don't list known/fully known items in
  object selection -- pelpel

Monster changes:
- Added a command to dismiss companions in the pet menu. Code adopted
  from T.o.M.E. 2.0.0 CVS -- Kusunose

Object changes:
- Combining rod and rod tip now considers rod's cheapness flag.
  -- Kusunose

Player changes:
- Give Ents scrolls of satisfy hunger instead of some food.  -- Kusunose

Misc changes:
- Shimmering terrain features no longer shimmer while running/resting,
  to make them more bearable on slower machines and slow I/O systems
  like GCU -- pelpel
- The tunnel code (ordinary one) now performs double check for
  feat_wall_outer and CAVE_ROOM, so it is safe to use any terrain
  features for outer wall, including those identical to fill_type.
  Note: These two changes have very significant effect on the Sacred
  Land of Mountains. I'm not 100% sure if this is what DG intended,
  but I believe so reading flags given to it in d_info.txt -- pelpel
- Depth/field name area is now 13 character long, so that names like
  "shallow water" will fit, and "Lothlorien" is not truncated in GCU.
  Also added short dungeon name prefix to the depth-in-feet mode -- pelpel
- Moved auto-squelch code from process_player() to process_world() -- pelpel
- CAVE_TRDT wasn't cleared when a trap is disarmed, which had some
  subtle effects and forced coders to double check c_ptr->info and
  c_ptr->t_idx in various places -- pelpel
- Changed repeated message code to V-CVS one -- pelpel
- Added another graphics mode variable called graphics_mode :),
  somewhat like use_graphics in ZAngband, but it doesn't
  require any changes to main-xxx.c. It's set within reset_visuals()
  and used by map_info(), so that it doesn't have to do streq()
  each time it is called -- pelpel
- Renamed 422colors.prf to 422color.prf, to make it fit with the 8.3 naming
  convention -- pelpel
- Add support for multiline comments in lua: --[[ ... ]]
- Improved lua interface for defining new 'm' keys, magic powers, quests, ...

Dungeon changes:
- There should be less not-at-all secret "secret" doors.
  This does *not* mean that ancient prob, but those mountains enbedded in
  plain wall in Barrow-Downs, for example -- pelpel
- The inn in Bree is now The Prancing Pony.  -- Kusunose

Bug fixes:
- Normal (non-vampire) races didn't get mana regenerated at Inn -- pelpel
- The Mathom house acted like a normal shop when selling.  -- Kusunose
- '-s' crashed the game. Thanks kobayashi for the fix -- pelpel
- Beastmaster Shanty overpayed a bounty if monster's corpses are stacked.
  -- Kusunose
- The random text code left files open in many error cases -- pelpel
- WeaponMasters were not restricted with their weapons.  -- Kusunose
- Info text of 'disrupt mind' was described as 'dam'.  -- Kusunose
- Fixed the "automatic ego filter" bug in the squeltch filter -- pelpel
- The polymorph random effect could crash the game. Thanks Kevin W.
  Thomas for the detailed analysis of the problem -- pelpel
- Stat draining effect of Black breath could crash the game. Thanks
  Kevin W. Thomas again for the patch -- pelpel
- With easy_disarm set, players were totally safe from detected traps,
  whatever messages might say -- pelpel
- Ego graphics code is now only active when and only when 16x16 tiles
  are selected -- pelpel
- Quest entrances/exits now require players to type '>'/'<' commands
  to move in/out -- pelpel
- Many room walls didn't have the CAVE_ROOM flag set -- pelpel
- Dungeon town generation could crash the game. Thanks Mogami
  for the analysis of the problem -- pelpel
- Supplied missing suid code in 1) savefile removal action in the startup
  screen, 2) time table lookup, 3) dungeon savefile removal, and
  4) bone file removal.  Thanks kobayasi for the patch -- pelpel
- Less platform-dependent savefile processing code for the game start
  menu, thanks again for kobayasi. It now uses files.c utility routines
or building appropriate savefile names -- pelpel
- Magical branding of weapon/ammo, when successful, now sets enchanted
  item's discount rate to 100%, so that one can no longer make vast
  profit or easily gain his/her deity's favour.  Code adopted from
  T.o.M.E. 2.0.0 CVS -- pelpel
- '/' in item selection didn't update screen correctly -- pelpel
- Level generation could cause infinite loop in the Sacred Land of
  Mountains -- pelpel
- Player ghosts were disabled in a way causing special feeling on
  every level -- pelpel
- Took 64-bit safe RNG from Vanilla -- pelpel
- Gave SPECIAL_GENE flags to the k_info.txt entries of SPECIAL_GENE
  special artefacts -- pelpel
- Player is now guaranteed to have initialive after entering a level.
  Thanks Joseph William Dixon for the patch -- pelpel
- Fixed a bug that caused gods start casting nasty effects when player's
  grace becomes negative. It should have been -60000.  -- Kusunose

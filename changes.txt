Changes in Animeband 0.5.2:

- Idiotic Paladin Glitch fixed
- Fixed *really* abusable Student glitch, so now Student transform is no longer instant.
  In exchange, student mana costs for the last two spells are lower.
- It is now pointless to enchant Magic Swords, as the to hit and to dam will be level
  deopendent.
- Magic Knights toned down just slightly (probably not noticeable)
- Sky Dragon Student and Magic Knight glitch fixed.  The exp needed to level up is now 
  correct.
- Black Market may sell some strange food stuffs.  That is fine.  It will be part of an
  upcoming "Cooking" feature.
- Some new monsters added -> I am running out of ideas.  Suggestions welcome.
- Kamitori no longer spawn.

6/02/2002 - 5/23/2003
Changes in Animeband 0.5.0 (from Angband 2.9.3):

- New Sound FX
- Added new monsters and new and interesting artifacts.
- New Races with new resistances and stat bonuses/penalties
- New and hopefully interesting spells for mages (priest prayers remain untouched)
- Has its own version number and name ^_^
- A new meter system is implemented.  When you get max meter, you are allowed to "limit break"
  (or "super", whatever you want to call it).  Such supers are dependent on what race you are
  and usually have good effects.  When you have maximum meter, press 'Z' to super.
- A new fighting style system is implemented.  The groove system affects how you gain meter along with
  some other things (critical hits, dodges, parrys, etc.)
- You can get drunk in this game :))  Though, the effects aren't exactly good.
- Some uniques never die.
- Some monsters will hit you, regardless of what armor you're wearing.  There are monsters out
  there which I suggest you run from...

Changes to the original Angband 2.8.3 source-code :

- Added player icon remapping, correct potion, ring, and spell colors.
- Greg Wooledge's random artifact generation code version 0.6.2.
- Easy Patch 1.1 by Tim Baker.
- Added the improved Monster AI by Keldon Jones.
- Added Keldon Jones' improved version of the Ben-Borg (an automatic Angband
  player) and modified it to coexist nicely with the other patches.
  The Borg will switch off graphics mode automatically.
  Press Ctrl-Z to enter the Borg Mode.  Press "z" again on the Borg Command-
  prompt to run the Borg.  For more information about the Borg, look at the
  Angband Borg Home Page - http://www.phial.com/angborg/
- Can use Adam Bolt's new Angband graphics as well as the old tiles.
  I've also implemented transparency and lighting effects
  (supported by DOS and Windows version).

All changes are optional and can be switched off.

DOS-specific changes:
- Graphics, sounds, and music options !!!
  You can switch the graphics/music/sound options from the user menu
  (press ! to get there).  The volume of the sound and the music can be
  adjusted from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  All changes to the screen-resolution
  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.
- Sound Events
  DOS-Angband will play samples from the "lib/xtra/sound" folder to the
  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm'). 

Windows-specific changes:
- Support for Adam Bolt's new tiles, with transparency and lighting effects.
- You can select between the "old" tiles, the new tiles, or ASCII mode
  (disable both graphic modes for ASCII).
- The Windows version no longer requires changes to angband.ini when
  installing.

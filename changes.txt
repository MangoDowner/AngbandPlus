- Add the possibility to engrave the floor with some magic words found in some
  parchements. The words are in Adunaic(Numeronean), Quenya, Sindarin or any
  other tongues of Middle Earth. But the parchement also give useless words
  with the usefull ones, so you have to try different combinaisons.
- No more "human" sex when randomly choosed

16/03/1999
- Mathilde will say the right sentences now
- Fixed a bug in melee2.c which could produce an x and an y out of the limits

  you, like summoning pets, curing wounds, killing ennemies...

19/03/1999
- There is now a minimun level needed to enter some dungeons, it's to prevent
  gaining great objects easily
- Fixed the OLD bug of the pink horrors, now only 2 blue horrors wil be summoned
- Fixed a bug with the tiles for the non uniques DragonRiders

21/03/1999
- The Dragon realm users recieve some experience for the kills of their pets
- The Palantir of Minas Tirith now can teleport you next to the quest monster
  but it'll take more time to recharge
- Fixed the possessor's number of blows bug. Also the town uniques corpse(
  Maggot, Martti, Mathilde) can't be used to attack because their attack is
  moan with no damage
- Added a faq(see pern_faq.txt)
- Added a new monster ally, the Dolphiner. They came from the planet Pern
  and can summon dragonriders, their friends. They are men riding dolphins

******************** Attempts to rebalance the game **************************
- Changed the xp modifers of the new races in an attempt to make them more
  balanced. Thanks to Shawn Cheng <mfighter@hotmail.com>
- Invulnerability, Wraith Form and Life Multiplier now consume a *lot* of food
- RohanKnight's gain less speed at each levels
- Sound attacks of the harpers are less likely to stun...
- IMPORTANT NOTE: At the character birth if you choose a forbidden class for
  your race, you'll be considered as a cheater and the game won't be scored.
  It's mainly to prevent the too powerfull combinaison of Deathmold Mimic or
  Deathmold Possessor. The characters made before the next release won't be
  affected by that
- Some more attempts that I don't remember :)
- Changed the Mana and life multipliers, now mage staff of mana(100%) will
  ADD 100% of mana to your max mana and not multiply it by 100 :)
******************************************************************************

23/03/1999
- Replaced Menegroth by the new Lothlorien skillfully made by Akhronath
  (zzhou22876@aol.com), with 2 new quests + The Battle of the Five Armies +
  (only for DragonRiders) The Fight against a Threadfall
  Thanks again Akhronath !
- Deathmolds can now enter wilderness
- Radicaly changed the score calculation, in the future it'll serve to choose
  which characters must be turned into monsters. Note that the old score files
  are compatibles but the old scores mean nothing with the new system

26/03/1999
- Changed some aspect of the python implementation to make it more portable
- The usleep python function may react strangely
- When you pick up the same type of ammo that you wield in your quiver it
  automatically combine with it
- The specials levels are now restricted to a certain depth AND a certain
  dungeon type
- The number of collected bounties now count for the final score
- Add a new option to not pick up monster's corpses. It's yes by default.
  I've made it to avoid losing good characters by auto picking up a great
  wyrm of power corpse and getting -500 speed !

28/03/1999
- Reimplemanted the player ghosts, but in a different way. First the bone files
  are a lot more complex to include more aspect of the dead character. Second
  only the best characters are allowed to become ghosts when they die, or commit
  sucide, it's based on their final score. In the bone directory there is a new
  file which held the name of the bone files that the player want ot be used.
  To add a bone file, put it in the bone directory, add it to the bones.txt file
  and increment the number of bone file in the same file.
  When a game is loaded it looks for this file, try to find some unallocated
  ghosts and modify r_info with the new info from the ghost. When this is done
  the bone file is not used anymore because all the infos are saved in the
  player savefile. The race/class characteristics are not fully handled now.
- Now even with a Mage Staff the Sorcerors have a penality of -10 to hit/dam
- A Vampire can now wield the Phial of Undeath without being scorched, while
  all the other light artifacts scorche them

30/03/1999
- The Arcane Zap spell now works correctly
- Updated the FAQ with the help of Leon Marrick
- Updated magic.txt with the help of Leon Marrick
- WOH ! Impressive ! Great work indeed ! Well, Andreas Koch has made a
  powerfull graphic editor for PernAngband !!!! And is has also drew some new
  tiles! The editor is realy impressive, you load the graphic file, the prf
  file and you can assign a tile to every monsters/objects/... you want, just
  with a click ! It can even scan the *_info.txt to search for new things that
  are not in the current prf file and to add them !
  You just need a big screen resolution(1152x864x16bits works for me)
  Thanks for the great work Andreas(akoch@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de) !
- The Archer class as suggested by Mike Hommel <jamul@hamumu.com>. They gain
  some extra shot and might with levels and can also create ammo with rubble
  and junks.

05/04/1999
- Fixed a bug in the Weyr of Arda at Lothlorien
- Add the artifact's descriptions made by ... well I don't have his/her name.
  Anyway, great work.
- The rings of teleportation can now be actived but they'll be destroyed in
  the process. It's like a last chance option :)

08/04/1999
- The uniques used in the specials levels are no more showed as killed in the
  list and can only be created in the special level.
  Note : This will only affect the new characters.
- Fixed : When a Power Mage spell fails it is not cast anyway.
- Wall creation works for Power Mage
- Divia wrote some missing artifact descriptions

12/04/1999
- Reimplemented the engraving feature. There is some parchements in the
  dungeon which contain Adunaic/Quenya/Sindarin/... words you can use to
  engrave the floor with 'x'(']' in the roguelike keyset). You must read them
  before engraving even if you know the words from your last game. Also the
  inscription is magical and so needs some mana to work. So there is a new
  and unique feature : each grid in the dungeon have some mana on it's own.
  You can sense the mana of one grid by pressing 'X'('[' in the roguelike
  keyset), but this is not very precise nor easy, it's based on the magical
  abitlity. When an inscription is used it decrease the grid's mana and when
  there is not enough mana the inscription don't work anymore. The maximum
  mana of each grid is 255. i.e: when you engrave the protection inscription
  which use 8 mana on a grid with 80 mana, a monster won't be able to walk on
  it for 80/8=10 turns, but well, this can save your life !
  Note : There is not a lot of inscriptions, if you have some ideas, don't
  hesitate, email me !

14/04/1999
- Changes in the r_info for the HAS_EGG flag as suggested by Akhronath
- Bloodletters of Khorne only have a 20% chance of dropping Blade of Chaos

  Shallow & Deep water(w, W) in the special levels
- Add a new dungeon type: The lost city of Numenor which is mainly constitued
  of water and which can be found at the west of Bree
********************* IMPORTANT *************************
- The savefile fom the old versions of PernAngband are no longer compatibles
  with the new one. It's mainly due to the new magic system but also some other
  changes. I'm sorry but this would be hard to write a convertisser since all
  the realm change(they have more spells) and so the books too and also the
  way to remenber which spells are known, forgotten, tried...
*********************************************************

22/04/1999
- Some new graphics from Andreas Koch
- Fixed the wilderness generation bug which sometimes hung the computer when
  trying to go on a wilderness border
- The features(in f_info.txt) have some flags now. This allows me to create 2

- The Sorcerors can now use the Wizard's and Prior's books
- The new magic system is ready. I'm just waiting for Akhronath and Shawn
  Cheng. And now additing a new realm or an old fashioned magic system is
  performed the same way and easily
- Add the Illusionists from Kangband. Someone has asked for them so... :)

28/04/1999
- Finished the Valarin Realm
- Between gates are now allowed in the vaults. To place them place 2 times a
  number from 0 to 7. I.e(from weisiger <jmartin@inreach.com>):
  D:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  D:#,,,,,X&...@X..**&X....9X
  D:#...&1X.,,,2X..**&X3...9X
  D:#...&.X1,,,.X2.**3X....9X
  D:#,,,,,X&...@X..**&X....9X
  D:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  But BEWARE ! You MUST put the 2 occurences of the number, no check are done
  so it'll surely crash or bug if not ! You've been warmed.

  They also begin the game with some gloves
- Add a Potion of Learning which allow you to learn one more spell than you
  normaly can do. No need to say that they are very rare
- The more you learn spells in a realm the more efficient with that realm
  you are

02/05/1999
- Implemented the Nether Realm

09/05/1999
- Magical stair at the bottom of each dungeon
- Reworked the imprinted pet system, now it will work lot better

- Add the speaking patch from Matt Graham. Just edit the monspeak.txt file
  to add new entries. And don't hesitate to send me what you've added !

11/06/1999
- There is less god and each god has one or two prefered races and if one of
  this race pray to him they gain better benefits. Also the praying effects
  are more differencied(based on the different gods)
- Add the 'only once' quest type
- It's harder to please your deity
- The Nazguls are MUCH more powerfull(ideas from Akhronath):
  ******** Quote from Akhronath mail ********
  All weapons which are not ego-items cannot harm them, and will be destroyed if
  the character hits a Nazgul with it. Ego-items which have slay evil or slay
  undead can harm them, but each hit has a 25% chance of destroying the weapon.
  Other ego-items can't damage them, and have the same 25% chance of
  destruction. An artifact weapon will be able to hit them only if the weapon
  has slay evil or undead, but the weapon will be hit with disenchantment every
  time it connects (but this is negated with disenchantment resistance on the
  character). And even these artifacts can be destroyed, although there's only a
  5% chance. Other artifacts, of course, can't damage the Nazgul, and still have
  the 5% destruction chance.

  When a character does any damage to a Nazgul or is damaged by a Nazgul, he has
  a 25% chance of being afflicted by the Black Breath. Thenceforth the character
  will slowly be drained of experience and sanity. The character can stay alive
  by using restoring and curing potions, but to cure the Black Breath he must
  either drink a Potion of Life or eat (a new item) Athelas Leaf. (Athelas isn't
  really eaten, of course, but I can't think of another simple way to implement
  it.)

  This will really make the player think twice before going up to a Nazgul, and
  makes it very useful to carry spare weapons.
  *******************************************
  So if you encounter a Nazgul .... FLEE AWAY !
- Sensing the grid's mana is now done by pressing 'x' key to engrave the floor
  The X key is free for some new function(maybe for the new riding system)

17/06/1999
- When browsing the spells while being a Power Mage there is no more bugs if
  pressing escape
- Removed the anti forbiden race/class combinaison feature. But it's alway
  possible to recompile PernAngband with it with the FORBID_BAD_COMBINAISON
  define(in config.h)
- New god : The RNG

19/06/1999
- The priest/prior/paladin's god is now choosen dependently of their race
- I have enough of hunting those damn ghost bug which makes them unable to
  move. So it's now a feature ! They don't move because they are GREAT
  adventurers who now just want to stand there to find peace :)
  Hey, fixing bugs is easy this way :))

22/06/1999
- When 'A'ctivating the first screen showed is the equipment and no more the
  inventory
- Some new gfx drew by Andreas Koch

06/07/1999
- You can place object kind in the special levels instead of artifacts by
  using 1000+k_idx as the number instead of just the artifact index

17/07/1999
- Add the Yeek race, but not as in Zangband. It's the one from Drangband.
  I was thinking of a race who advance even quicker than the humans in levels
  since a long time and I've found it !
  So they suffer lots of disadvantages but need realy less exp than the other
  races, i.e: When a DragonRider comes to level 2 a Yeek can already be at
  level 7 !!
- Added the FLY attribute, it allows you to fly over trees and mountains
  because it's no longer possible with the levitation one. It's also a lot
  rarer since it's POWERFULL in Galgals and Mirkwood. DragonRiders have it
  by default. There is also a changment in the features flags, CAN_LEVITATE
  means that you can just avoid them by floating over it(like a pit,
  water, ...) and CAN_FLY means that you must have the FLY flag to cross it.

19/07/1999
- The monster's drop are now created at the same time as the monster is
  created. First it disallow the scumming of monster's drops. And the most
  important thing is that it will allow me to add the new ability of stealing
  objects from monsters(everyone will be able to do it, but only Rogue will
  be excelent at that). For the point of view of the player there is no change.
  It may produce some strange object disappearence in the late game since
  all the objects are generated with the dungeon. And thus it may need to
  increament the maximum size of o_list in misc.txt. If such problems shows
  up, email me.
- Press 'Z'('[' in roguelike mode) to STEAL an item from a monster. The
  succes rate is based on your dexterity, the fact that you are or aren't
  a Rogue(being one make it easier), the weight of the object to steal and
  the base level of the monster. A Rogue will also gain some experience
  if he/she succed. This made them more Rogue and less Warriors.

22/07/199
- Add more graphics from Andreas Koch along with a new version of the editor

26/07/1999
- The resurection effect of the gods is now harder to get and decrease a lot
  more your grace. It was ... well ... too powerfull for the cost of some
  crappy artifacts
- Finished the Magery realm created by Chris Weisiger (jmartin@inreach.com)

03/08/1999
- I've finnaly fixed it ! You know, this ugly bug that unallow the darkening
  of the grass & mud tiles when they have been lited.

18/08/1999
- Yeah ! It's done the new magic system is finished(I will add Spirit Realm
  latter). The final form if 4 Major Realms : Valarin, Nether, Magery, Shadow
  and 4 Minor Realms : Crusade, Tribal, Sigaldry, Illusion.
  The only problem is be that it could be unbalanced, specialy the Shadow realm
  since I've created it :)
  Anyway it should be great. There is still a lot of old spells but some new
  coloured funny spells for you to discover, as Control the Ring, Infuse Amulet,
  Scribe Scroll, Doppleganger, Volcano Flow, Tidal Wave, and a lot of other !
  The max number of spells a character can learn depends on his class. But
  generaly the player can learn less spells than the total number of spells he
  has in all the books he can read.
  I want to thanks Akhronath(who has the first idea and who write some realms),
  Shawn Cheng, Chris Weisiger and DSCreamer<DSCreamer@aol.com> for their great
  help.
- Moldoux can not appear at an other level than level 1

21/08/1999
- A new version of the Tile Editor plus a full set of graphs(expect the books)!
- Moved the dungeon types definitions from tables.c to a new info file in the
  lib directory: d_info.txt
  It allows you to add new dungeon types easily.
  There is also a brand new feature: You can specify which monster flags that
  are NEEDED for a monster to be generated in the dungeon.
  There is also an addition of dungeon flags. Here is the structure:
  N:<index>:<name>
  D:<long name>
  W:<min depth>:<min depth>:<min player level>:<next dungeon>:<flags mode>:<min alloc>:<max alloc chance>
  L:<floor1>:<%1>:<floor2>:<%2>:<floor3>:<%3>
  A:<wall1>:<%1>:<wall2>:<%2>:<wall3>:<%3>:<outer wall>:<inner wall>
  F:<flags>
  M:<monster flags>
  S:<monster spells>
- The quest rewards are always good
- I've finnaly found and fixed the Mirkwood Spiders Quest

24/08/1999
- Add the MAZE flag to the dungeon type flag list, which instead of a normal
  dungeon generate a full big maze ! And it's EVIL ! Note that there will be
  no rooms and no vaults generated, just a plein evil maze
  The algorithm is from <Pierre.Bru@spotimage.fr> on rec.games.roguelike.development
- Note about the dungeons : A dungeon can't have more than 40 levels
- You can use SMALLEST, SMALL and BIG as dungeon flags to specify the level's
  size
- 6 new dungeon types: a Graveyard, an Illusory Castle, an Orc cave, a Maze
  a Dragon's Lair and A Forest with specific gfxs and monsters restrictions
- Some new gfx form Andreas Koch nostly to add more flavor to the towns

29/08/1999
- You can add a guardian and a guardian artifact to each dungeons types with
  the following flags: FINAL_ARTIFACT_artifact_number and
  FINAL_GUARDIAN_guardian_number

  Mithrandir at the bottom
- You can't gain a fate before being level 10
- Some cosmetic changes suggested by Akhronath
- A new Artifact by Akhronath, The Long Sword of Murazor 4d5, so ... the next
  time you see a long sword 4d5, beware ...

05/09/1999
- Add a feature flag to allow running
- Fixed the Chaos Warriors bug(they were unable to use magic !)
- Fixed the Chaos Realm descriptions
- You can't rest on a between gate
- You can now stole from stores. But beware of the consequences if you fail...
- Fixed a bug in that when recalling to the town the player was sometimes
  placed in the upper left corner

08/09/1999
- Fixed a bug that unallowed the creation of entrance to some vaults

14/09/1999
- Fixed the Dragon Tower bug
- Add minimun player level to the random dungeons
- Add shafts, you can use them do go up/down for up to 4 levels(but you can't
  ignore quest levels). Original patch from Static Chaos. Idea from GSN
- Add a dungeon falgs to forbig generation of doors

27/09/1999
- Some tweaks to the possessor code as written by Static Chaos i.e:
  You lust possess a monster that is able to open to door to do so. The
  same applies to bashing. Your sex is modified by your body. Lots of tweaks
  to the spells that can be used...
- The racial power of the Dwarves is now the same as The Pick of Erebor
  activation: they can find hidden passage in the walls
- There is 1 chance in 10 that the level is an magical level, which means that
  each grid will contain more mana than a normal level.
- Add some new sentences to the monsters sentences

04/10/1999
- Began to add the Druid class. But it's TOTALY different from the other
  variant's Druids. They make intense use of the mana flow from within the
  earth and the elements, thus their spells can regenerate the mana they have
  used by pumping it from the floor, like the Tunnel spell which will blink
  the player and will try to absorb enough mana form the grid he/she lands on.
  They can also(and they are the only to be able to do that) regenerate the
  mana flow of the earth. They also can use enhanced attack types called
  Druidist Bolt/Beam/Ball that can follow a mana flow laid by the player.
- The Druids can sense precisely the amount of mana of a grid

08/10/1999
- Added some revised graphics by Andreas Koch
- Added the code provided by Alexey Guzeev(aga@russia.crosswinds.net) to
  compile PernAngband under OS/2 with EMX
- It's finnaly fixed ! the damn bug that was crashing the game when leaving
  a town on certain system(Mac and Windows) ! this will never happen again !

27/10/1999
- Finished the Druid class. They have 40 spells(8 * 5 books). The spells that
  activate Mana Runes is not active for now, but it will in a near future.
- Add a slightly modified Tom Morton fake artifact patch(it won't print {} at
  the end)

30/10/1999
- You can inscribe an object with !! to notify the player when it's recharged
- Lots of bug fixes thanks to Lothar Lange <100644.2004@compuserve.com>
- Lots of new ideas thanks to Lothar Lange <100644.2004@compuserve.com>

30/10/1999 - PernAngband 4.0.1
- "Foolish mortal! Thou hast not pleased me! I'll doom your game with the new
  horrible DG curse !"
  Yes I've done it, the DG curse is even worse than the TY one. One of it's
  most perverse feature is that it can replicate itself to contamine sane
  objects that can't be cured. Also if you remove the curse of a DG cursed
  object, it will recurse itself automaticaly !
  Beware of the horrible Long Sword of Murazor because it carries the ancient
  morgothian curse !
  Oh, there is also some monsters that give the DG Curse when dying ... but
  I'll let you find whose they are by yourself :-<|>  (Dark God makes an evil
  smile). I can just say one thing : you should *REALY* *NOT* kill Mathilde...
  But do not worry she's got much more HP, so you can't kill her anymore :)

01/11/1999
- Add the Rod of Home Summoning, which acts like the old dragon spells
  "Call Home"

08/11/1999
- Drastically reduced the recharging time of the Dragon Scale mails in order
  to render them usefull.
- Added a new weapon ego-item: of Spining, which will make you spin around
  in order to hit every monsters around you. Note that you'll only get one
  blow for each monsters whatever is your normal number of blow.
- Added(ok stolen) the question in the GSNband FAQ about wrists hurting(it can
  be usefull, so everyone should know)
- Rogues and monks have more and more stealth as they gain levels(SBF)
- Added some sentences for the Dwarves(in monspeak.txt)
- Added the support of two-handed weapons(from GSN). Thus there is weapons
  that can be handled with two or one hand(but with one hand it halfs the
  damage). A 2 handed weapon can't be wielded with a shield.
- Added the random character name generation from Cthangband
- Added rivers(water & lava) from the Steven Fuerst fractal patch. Note that
  you have to add WATER_RIVER, LAVA_RIVER, WATER_RIVERS or LVA_RIVERS to a
  dungeon to have some rivers generated(actually in Mordor(lava), Dragon lair
  (Lava) and Forest(Multiple Water))
- Updated generate.c to the Steven Fuerst fractal patch room generator(using
  room_alloc), in order to implement the remaining part of the patch easier.
  But I'm still having problem to adapt it to my extended dungeon generator.
- Ahah ! I've resolved the problem !! there is now fractal rooms(15%, can be
  always enabled by specifying the CAVE flag), now the orc caves looks great

10/11/1999
- Added the Caverns(enabled via the CAVERN flag)
- Hell has been moved down, it now begins at level 666(!:)

12/11/1999

  dungeon(which has the PERSISTENT flag) on the disk and reload it instead of
  regenerating a new level.
- Add the Outer World dungeon type(this is an entrance to a place of an
  incredible stability). It use the PERSISTENT flag and thus will be saved.
  Only level 50 characters can go there to prevent abuse(like have an old
  ultra powerfull character and a new one and going into the Outer World to
  exchange some stuff). And yes the saved dungeons are the same for EVERY
  characters. But to add ... err ... variety,  I've put it from level 300 to
  305, I've put it to have at least 30 monsters from the begining AND to have
  an higher monster generation rate(1/60 instead of 1/160 !), thus you'll
  NEVER get bored there :)
- Implemented the much more complex trap system from Angband/64 thanks to the
  patch made by Static Chaos. There is 169 traps(see tr_info.txt).
  Beware that in the average the traps are deadlier...
- It comes along with a new feature for stat system: temporary stat drain,
  it's cool

14/11/1999

  The Small Water Cave, The Sacred Land Of Mountains(if you don't fly ...
  do not even plan on going there),
  The Wild Land Of Kurukar(It sure looks great)

04/12/1999
- New dungeons flags: HOT and COLD that affect object decay
- Add YA*IF(Yet Another *_info File): wt_info.txt
  It defines wilderness features *, allowing a better wilderness map. Since
  it now defines nearly everything a wilderness need to have, the map itself
  only have to be an array of feature and seed, thus allowing a much bigger
  wilderness. I also plan to have a Omega wilderness mode where you can have
  an overview of the wilderness to travel quicker(but time will pass much more
  quicker too:)
  The structure of w_info is also changed, it's uglier but well .... :)
  The wilderness size must be EXACTLY the same as the size defined in misc.txt.

06/12/1999
- Scrolls of Reset Recall are now WORKING !!!!!
- The new wilderness mode is done ! WHen you reach the border of a wilderness
  screen you go to the small scale wilderness map, where you can see all
  the wilderness map with the towns/dungeons/... A lot of commands are
  disabled there and moving takes MUCH more time, so beware of the food !
  You can enter the big scale mode by pressing >(this allow you to enter towns)
  NOTE: The Death Molds CAN'T reach the small scale mode because of their
  erratic movements that are impossible to handle in such a scale.
  BEWARE: Your imprinted pets WON'T follow you in the wilderness !!!

11/12/1999
- Add wilderness encounters
- Add Oangband rod/wand stacking

- Add the tool slot. It's actualy only used to wield a shovel/pick but I've
  some plans for it
- You can only dig walls if you use a shovel/pick in yout tool slot

24/12/1999
- Removed the player ghosts, well in fact made them a compile-time option(see
  config.h)

26/12/1999
- Added the Necromancer class. But again not quite the same as you've seen
  before. They can't be killed as easily as the other class. In fact when
  their HP comes to 0 they don't die but become undead for a while. While
  being undead their HP is replaced by DP(Death Points) that have a max
  inferior to the max HP and that are slowly decreasing(1 DP less each turn).
  They can use all the healing spells/potions/... but this won't stop them
  from being reduced again. The only way for them to come back in the world
  of the living is to kill 2 * player_level monsters.

01/01/2000
- Happy New Year !

02/01/2000
- Add a new curse(as suggested by LucFrench@aol.com). When a weapon has this
  curse and that the wielder attacks a monster with it, it can clone it !

  wyrms :)

10/01/2000

  improved.
  Now to switch the wilderness mode, just press < or >.
  Everything should now works properly

16/02/2000
- Each Nazgul will now drop his Ring of Power. They are randomly generated
  and thus they don't appear in a_info.txt. They always give invisibility,
  life draining and are heavy cursed.

21/02/2000
- Changed the format of w_info.txt again, it's much more readable now.
  I also added a additionnal parameter to the W lines of wf_info to define
  which letter will be used in w_info.txt
- 60x20, this is the scale of the new wilderness, it tries to looks like
  the 3rd age middle earth map. Thus some dungeons leaved the towns they
  were used to be to join their "real" place on the map. Only the Upper
  Reaches of Galgals are still reachable from Bree.

- Began to add the Body parts system to allow more rings, weapons,
  everything, depending of your current corpse(dragons will have more rings,
  mariliths 2 weapons, ...)

  let see a Sorceror using Ringil AND Gandalf ! :) well first he have to find
  the rare scroll to change body and then to find the corpse that allow 2
  weapons

  not the dungeons. one file for each level named dun$dungeon$.$level$
  In it you can have some declarations, like B:dungeontype which will
  create a stairway to an other dungeon, thus allowing to have "branchs"
  in the dungeons.
  L:dungeontype and L:level specify which is the "father" dungeon and at which
  level the stair appear.
  S:ext means to save the level(and thus to reload it) in the player.ext file
  so allowing the use of persistents levels(the persistent dungeons option
  is gone)

  have the worst magic device skill of all the classes, they continuously
  generate an anti-summoning field around them disabling monsters from
  summoning. The radius of the field increase with levels. After level 20

  power(rods of nothing) with a certain quality(wooden, iron, ...) on which
  depends the amount of mana they contain. You can also find rod tips which
  contain the real spells but can not be actived alone. You must attach(with
  the 'z' command) a rod tip to a base rod before using it. The spells of the
  different rod tips need different amouts of mana(so illumination is less
  mana hungry than healing :). You can also have base rods ego-items(artifacts
  soon) that can decrease the mana cost of the spell, increase the capacity
  of the rod, decrease the time needed to zap the rod, ...
  Oh BTW, you should be eager to get an Adamantite Rod of Healing of the
  Istari :)
  Now rods will hopefully be usefull.
  Note that you have to identify the base rod to get the mana indicator
- Note files are now playername.nte instead of playername.txt
  So if you want your note file to be carrie to the next verison you'd better
  rename it :)

  Caves

  wilderness map using the WILD_ix_iy__ox_oy flag in d_info.txt.
  ix, iy are the coordinates on the wilderness map of the entrance.
  ox, oy are the coordinates of the exit.
  Note that each of them(entrance and exit) must have a physical entrance
  on the wilderness map(that is a line in w_info.txt).
  When you use the entrance to enter you get to the first level but when you
  use the exit to enter you get to the last level.
  So now you can have dungeons that create shortcuts in the map.
  Or even allow to go in previously unreachable places(like now the dungeon
  of Moria allows you to reach  a secret valey in the Mountains of the Moria
  which allow getting to some other dungeons)

- Found why under certain circumstances forbidden objects could still be
  generated(and thats also fixed now :)
- Dungeons & Monsters can now have object themes(yeah I know, I stole that
  from Zangband, thought the dungeon theme was in my head for long, but
  when I steal I do amit it ...)
  For exemple The Sandworm lair is really full of magical items, while the
  Orc Caves are more on the side of the weapons & armors. And the Dragon Lair
  is filled with ... oh well everything :) and so on.
  So it's now really worth to get out of the 4 basic dungeons and see the
  wild world!
  All dungeons are done with the themes, it could take a bit longer for
  the (1031) monsters... :)
  NOTE: Dragon Scale Mails are considered TREASURES

- Ego Monsters, yes like Ego items but for monsters. New file re_info.txt
  define all possible ego monsters types(skeletons, zombie, ...). It can
  modify, the flags, spells, level, speed, ac, ... of the monster that is
  turned into an ego monster.
  This will increase the randomness of the game, increase the number of
  monsters from 1031 to .. a lot... :)
  There are not much ego monsters right now, so feel free to submit them

  work. The stats are permanently reduced upon faillure(as it always meant to

  minus the enchantment(a +5+5 one will only do 40%) on a 5 distance(also

  a 50% chance of stopping a spell

  wilderness timescale
- Fixed a quets bug that allowed the player to regenerate the quest many times
- The Contol the Three shadow spell is now much much more effective, since
  it removes black breath and DG_CURSE. The only little annoying thing is that

  no hope for them) or The Scroll of Deincarnation

  fated to die on he gets teleported to a special level in a special dungeon.
  the level is empty, small and full of really ut of depth monsters. Recall,

        3) Cast it from a carved runestone(uses 75% mana and does NOT need the
           runes to be present in the inventory, but canibalyse the runes at
           creation and must carry it around)
- Mormegil is now a Darksword and is quite nice
- Lesser & Greater Krakens now drop corpse

24/04/2001

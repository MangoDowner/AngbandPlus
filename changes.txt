  spell power x5, after all Sauron has put the most part of his power in it.
  I also plane to change the activation.
- Add 2 wands artifacts, The Wand of Stone to Mud of Thrain and the Wand of

  flooded levels(if choosen in the options).
  The ability to levitate is now a GREAT advantage in the Mirkwood forest !

  flame can consume them!

28/02/1999

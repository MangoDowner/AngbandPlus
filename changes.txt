  version.

Windows specific changes:
- You can select between the "old" tiles, the new tiles, and ASCII mode.
- The Windows version no longer requires changes to angband.ini when
  installing.  The angband.ini file will be created when you first start
  the program, so it doesn't need to be present in the binary archive.
  That also allows easy updates to newer versions, since the settings
  in the angband.ini are not overwritten when installing a new version
  over an old one.
- The windows can be resized and the (graphical) tiles will adjust
  automatically to the new size.
- Added the "Show scores" command to the menu.
- Fixed a bug that created all files as "read-only" (causing the game to
  fail when saving the game).
- Fixed a bug that caused all numbers to be registered twice by the game,
  leading to "double-steps".
- Fixed a bug that didn't free the used bitmaps correctly when closing
  the game.

DOS-specific changes:
- Graphics, sounds, and music options
  You can switch the graphics/music/sound options from the user menu
  (press ! to get there).  The volume of the sound and the music can be
  adjusted from 0 (min) to 255 (max).  All changes to the screen-resolution
  and the selection between the old and the new graphical tiles will be
  active after you restart Angband.
- Terminal windows
  The windows can be activated from the "Angband options screen"
  (press the '=' key to get there) in the "Window flags" menu.
  Just toggle the display you want for "Term-1" and "Term-2".
- Added a stone-background to the terminals.
- Midi jukebox
  DOS-Angband automatically plays midi-files from the "lib/xtra/music"
  folder in your Angband-directory.
- Sound Events
  DOS-Angband will play samples from the "lib/xtra/sound" folder to the
  corresponding Angband-event. You can configure the available samples in
  the "lib/xtra/sound/sound.cfg" file.  Multiple sounds per event are
  supported.
- "Classic mode": If you want the old display, just start Angband with the
  '-mibm' option ('Angband.exe -mibm').

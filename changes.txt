Chocolate Angband changes from Vanilla 2.8.2

Chocolate 2.8.2
- Added NT-style food
- Added NT-style morale
- Added NT-style roguelike messages
- Removed preserve mode.  Note, however, that a level is 'Special' if
  and *only* if it contains an artifact.  Hopefully, this will make
  non-preserve a bit less nasty.
- Removed autoscum.  If you want better items and nastier monsters,
  dive faster.  If you just want vaults, too bad.
- Item destruction caused by elemental attacks and spells is affected by
  damage done, so resists help in protecting your inventory.
- Added the telnet #define to config.h which redraws the screen at 
  various points that tend to leave screen droppings on telnet connections

Chocolate 2.8.3
- Added NT-style free market economy.  Buying things increases their prices.
  Selling things decreases their prices.  Expensive things are more likely
  to be sold in the shops.

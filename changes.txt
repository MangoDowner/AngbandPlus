2.9.1 BETA
- Updated the source code base to Angband 2.9.1 which involves numerous
  minor changes (see change lists for standard Angband for details).
- Females no longer get more gold at character birth.
- Removed the pseudo-graphics in inventory, equipment and store
  listings (may be restored later).
- Pet fear handling removed (pet handling in general will get a major
  overhaul in the next version).

2.8.3j patch-level 1

- Random character/attribute options added to birth.
- Fixed faulty vault layout (Greg Wooledge).
- Now prints home details after death instead of black market stock.

  multiple gifts (eg. Sting).

  arguments, etc.

2.9.1.1
- Applied all the bug-fix patches to the 2.9.1 source available on
  Thangorodrim.
- Updated the makefiles using gcc to use the '-fno-strength-reduce'
  switch.
- Assigning the "LEVITATION" flag as an intrinsic racial ability via
  p_info.txt should now have the appropriate effect.
- Fixed a bug with the timed levitation spell (which necessitated an
  increment to the version number).
- Fixed a bug that allowed cast spells to bypass the adult_ironman
  option and scrolls/rods of recall to bypass the time/space anchor.
- Fixed a bug with the adult_no_stores option that let you enter the
  special buildings when it was set.
- You may no longer cross the "Chasm" terrain when levitating. This is
  in preparation for adding chasm streamers deep in the dungeon.
- Crossing lava is now allowed without fire resitance or levitation.
  However, you will take varying amounts of damage without these. Only
  fire immunity provides complete protection. Taken from Zangband.
- Crossing deep water when overburdened is now allowed. However, you
  will take damage from doing so unless you are levitating. Taken
  from Zangband.
- If the Illusion spell 'Shadow Form' expires while the player is
  moving through rock, the player will now take damage from being
  crushed. Adapted from Zangband.
- Fixed a problem with the 'Unknown Building' quest in the 'Haunting
  of Telamoor' plot which resulted in a 'nothing' object being
  created.
- Added various missing entries to font-ibm.prf, font-xxx.prf and
  font-new.prf (but have not checked for completeness). In most cases,
  this was done by assigning tiles used by Zangband for similar (in
  some sense) things. Note that 16x16 tiles are unavailable in some
  cases (denoted below by '*'). The non-trivial mappings are as
  follows:

  Kangband			Zangband

2.9.1 BETA
- Updated the source code base to Angband 2.9.1 which involves numerous
  minor changes (see change lists for standard Angband for details).
- Females no longer get more gold at character birth.
- Removed the pseudo-graphics in inventory, equipment and store
  listings (may be restored later).
- Pet fear handling removed (pet handling in general will get a major
  overhaul in the next version).

- Fixed faulty vault layout (Greg Wooledge).
- Now prints home details after death instead of black market stock.

  died. If you have a save-file where a quest cannot be completed

  multiple gifts (eg. Sting).

  the same owners).

  arguments, etc.

Portralis 0.4 build 002.

CHANGES
---------


Gameplay:

- Some changes were done to further improve the Rogue class:
        * Stealhy Fighter now provides a bonus to damages based on Stealth.
	* Thievery has been improved. (see the changes to Thievery and Divine Items below)
	* Deadly Stalker no longer requires you to be "invisible through a special ability".
          It was also bugged and has been fixed(see bugs fixed below).
- Enemy counters have been nerfed. Now, your general skills and specialized skills will be
  added to your rolls for counter bypassing. So if you attack with a sword, in addition to
  your strength and dexterity, your Swords skill will also be added. Also, defensive skills
  will now lower enemy rolls. Defense+Agility for melee and ranged, and Magic Defense for
  magic. Finally, melee blocking from monsters have been greatly lowered, it used to be
  strength+dexterity, which resulted in very, very high rolls. Now, it will use the average
  of both stats, making the melee block rolls more on par with ranged and magic counters.
- Thievery and Divine Items were pretty much identical. They have been changed, so that Thievery
  has an emphasis on base damages and base AC, while Divine Items provides more general bonus,
  which are more helpful to a caster. Both have received a general boost.
- Teleporting monsters will no longer teleport when struck by brands or similar powers.
- Hide's duration is now 10 + 10% of Stealth skill.
- Hunters of Zekis are now a bit rarer, and can now drop magic items. It's the first "pack"
  enemy that has magic items drops, but it's only fair, since they can be very, very painful
  to fight.

Content:

- Not much of a content patch, but I did add a few artifacts ideas that Gando sent me a while
  ago. That, and an artifact reward for beating the sealed stairway quest in Avemorsh.

Bugs fixed:

- Implemented Adelie's changes to the code to allow compilation under Linux and 64 bits OS.
- Divine Items and Thievery should now properly work on instruments and thrown weapons.
- Stealthy Fighter was checking if the player was NOT invisible to a monster! Meaning that
  the higher your Stealth was, the more unlikely the ability was to occur!
- Many of the Kensai's abilities were using calculations that would cause them to overflow
  in damages, and thus cause no damages because the numbers becomes negative. This should now be fixed.

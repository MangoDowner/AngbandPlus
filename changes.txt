SAngband 0.9.3 (04/04/97):
1) "Mystic" weapons should now work.
2) Priest spells are matched correctly.  Also, the "elemental brand" prayer
will properly brand weapons.
3) Luck cannot be minimized with the autoroller and is not displayed until
the player casts self-knowledge.  Players no longer become extremely lucky by
going back to a previous character.
4) Weapons with "venom" now work correctly.
5) Self-knowledge has been fixed to display all flags.
6) The player's "spell level" is calculated differently so that it cannot be
higher than 50.  The "teleport" prayer should not lock up the game.
7) Serpentine weapons are no longer vorpal (I had them erroneously defined as
being the same :).)  Weapons that were vorpal in v0.8.9 are once again
vorpal.
8) No more cursed "holy avenger" boots (oops...)
9) The screen should always withdraw from the talent screen.
10) Angband 2.8.0 -> 2.8.1 changes apply.
11) There is now a maximum speed of +70.  (A player reported getting his
speed higher than this and losing the ability to move, so I have put in a
max.)
12) No more "Bootses" or "Gauntletses" when forged boots or gloves stack.

SAngband 0.9.2 (01/25/97):
1) The "spiritual hammer" prayer now works correctly.
2) To-dam modifiers of weapons now work.
3) A number of cosmetic things have been fixed (the spell info is correct for
all few more spells, the word "Invisible" is now taken off the screen when
the player is no longer invisible, etc.)
4) All races, except humans, dunedain, and high-elves get much less "life
experience" when starting out.
5) Fixed a bug which would cause the player to start out with a large amount
of negative exp if the total of his stat mods were negative.

SAngband 0.9.1 (01/11/97):
1) The cursor is now moved properly when choosing stat modifiers.
2) Weaponsmithing, armor forging, bowmaking, and fennling all work correctly.
Bowmaking will never create a seeker arrow when a bow is requested.
Forged/fennled items no longer lose their properties when the game is saved.
3) The necro "Infuse Weapon" and "Curse Weapon" spells no longer work on
artifacts.  "Curse Weapon" now works correctly.
4) Fixed a bug which caused some spells not to take a turn if they had no
effect on the player (eg, casting Curse Weapon on a weapon that was already
cursed).
5) Fixed the bug which caused Morgoth not to exist (so you can actually win
the game...)
6) V0.9.0 would erroneously flag all priest, druid, and necro spells as being
untried.  Fixed.
7) "Nothing" items no longer appear in the temple.  (I'm not exactly sure why
they were appearing, actually, but they will no longer appear.)
8) "Recall()" is now called "recall_player()" to avoid conflicting with the
recall variables in some term packages (Acorn, Amiga, X11, Xaw).  Thanks to
Greg Wooledge (wooledge@kellnet.com) for pointing this out.
9) Special druid and necro books are now considered "good" (treated as
special magic and prayer books are).
10) The spell info (which is displayed when browsing books, etc) is now
correct.
11) The amount of weight that the player is carrying is now updated properly
when altering the number of objects in a stack with wizard mode.
12) See invisible now works.
13) Hellfire does less damage now.  Monsters that appear in groups no longer
cast it.  ALso, this attack is now described as a spell rather than a breath.

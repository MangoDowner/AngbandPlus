\Changes for SillyBand v0.1.0 from Angband v2.8.3
------------------------------------------------
* 'fake' version numbers setup.. now everything
         shows up as SillyBand v0.1.0
* Changed following things:
	* Poison resistance rings now appear at lvl 40 instead of 60,
	  since this is really when you need them (as drolems soon
	  appear).. But, to balance this out a bit, they are no longer
	  worth 16,000au... Now, only 7,000... sawwwy =)
	* Rings of speed no longer appear at lvl 80, but at lvl 65..
	  And are only worth 55,000au, not 100,000.. This value may
	  change later. 
* Rangers now start with a short sword instead of a broad sword.
* mages now start with a scroll of teleport instead of a dagger
* a new level feeling:
"you have a not so fresh feeling about this level"
* HUGE radical changes to stat gain:
	* int & wis potions start appearing at lvl 20, get very common at
lvl 25.
	* str & dex potions may appear at lvl 25, and get very common at
lvl 30.
	* chr potions appear at same d
	* CON potions start appearing at lvl 43.. but con rings appear at
	lvl 33 and deeper, with a possible pval of +to-con 3d3.
* amulets of intelligence -> amulets of brilliance: affect both INT and
WIS
* amulets of wisdom -> amulets of resistance.. give 4 elemental
  resistances.
* gnomes get an extra +1 to INT.. this balances them with high-elves,
	and gives players a choice of starting with free action or
	see invis.
* flasks of oil are now fire-branded =)
* Phial of Galadriel can now be activated every 5 turns, and
  has Zangband's +1-to-searching change.
* Upped wand damage greatly. Now hopefully they'll be found to be 
	a bit more useful :)
* Made Draebor the Imp DROP_GREAT =)
* Made Cantoras the Skeleton Lord's color be Light Blue instead of
 White. People on R.G.R.A had complained about it recently, and its
 true. Colors for monsters need to be picked more carefully.. There
 are, after all, 16 colors to pick from yet people decide to pick
 WHITE for a tough skeleton unique, as opposed to white being the
 same color for skeleton kobolds.
* added two new types of breath attacks: water, and crap.
	* the water type of attack was already defined in some places,
	I believe for water bolt spells and such that monsters use,
	but anyway it made debugging a bit annoying at certain places;
	presumably since I have been coding now for 5 1/2 hours in a row..
	and my brain feels funnnnyy.
* finished adding crap hounds :-) unlike any *OTHER* breathers in the
game, they don't breathe for 1/6 of their hp. They breathe for TWICE
their HP. Awwww. And crap also reduces Charisma.
* added two new artifacts! The Dagger 'Immuno' and the Whip of the
	Balrog...
* Added the Executioner's Sword 'Slayer' from Zangband.
	NOTE: Only thing it doesn't have is the Vampiric flag.
* Frost Bolt renamed to Frost Shard under mage spell listings. 
* clay oil lamps! hold 1/2 the oil of brass, radius of a torch,
  but cheaper than a brass lantern at its current price. does 3d4
  damage when thrown. brass lanterns now cost 200 gp.. I was very
  proud of myself after I hacked in that incredibly complex code
  I wrote in to the lamp refueling procedure.. to not only refuel
  brass lanterns but clay lamps... Be warned. If *ANYONE* takes
  a look at this procedure and goes to modify it, for whatever
  reason; be careful. cmd3.c alone gets about 4 warnings now
  from my modifications..
* rods of augmentation (thangorodrim) and rods of pesticide [Z]
* changed mage's Sleep II spell to See Invisible. renamed Sleep III
	to Sleep II.
* Patched Tom Morton's 'fake artifact' patch in. Inscribe an item
with #of some name! and it will become, say, a Dagger of some name! (1d4)
(+0,+0) {}
	* Future plans: Hack -TM-'s fake artifact patch so you can either
		inscribe a name at the beginning of an item, or after.
		So for example, if you want to inscribe it at the
beginning of an item;

		a dagger of burning inscribed with of death

		becomes a dagger of death of burning instead of a dagger
		of burning of death..

		i can't think of a purpose to do this, but i don't feel
		like adding in monsters right now. so i think i want to
		add this.... i'd like to change it, so i could have say
		instead of a dagger, a small mage's dagger or something
		like that.
* added Tim Baker's easy patch.
* combined rings of resist fire and cold into rings of resist fire
and cold.. put rings of sustain stat together to make:
	rings of sustain str & dex
	sustain int & wis
	sustain con & chr

	this freed up some ring slots, one of which was used to make:
	a ring of acid and elec resistance
	....
* added scrolls of taxes.. very late at night. i playtested them,
  as i usually do with *EVERY* new feature after i code it... and
  discovered it was buggy. oh well, i'll either fix it in the morning,
  or release it with the bug in it. but scrolls of taxes don't disappear
  either... weird.
* Fixed the bug in scrolls of taxes (turned out to be in all scrolls).
  now scrolls get destroyed when read! (yay!)
* Updated startup screen.
* Changed "breeds explosively" to "breeds explosively holding a porno
and a napkin", in monster1.c and wizard1.c
* Changed Acid Bolt in Raal's to a Mana Bolt.. Unresistable damage :-)
* Added a small feature where if you hit the '[' key it toggles how
to display your depth, and redraws the screen. IE: Say your on level 1
of the dungeon and it says 50 ft, and you want it to say Lev 1; well
just hit [ and it will automatically change it for you! Neato eh?
* Went thru the whole r_info.txt, and made many monsters have fewer
immunities and only a few monsters have ALL immunities... (note:
sauron doesn't even has all immunities)
* Added a cool damage formula for Mana Bolt! >:-)
* Finished adding new ego-item: Weapons of Quickness!
* Merged 'p' and 'm' commands into one command!
	* Now you use m for all magic-casting and prayer-praying..
	  The code even worked on the first try! :-)
	* Note, I did not MERGE do_cmd_cast and do_cmd_pray... I did
	  this so I could use the 'p' key for any command I might
	  wish to add in the future. 
* Forgot something when implementing clay lamps... Forgot to have
  them show up in the General Store! This took a moment to fix 
  in init2.c





changes to make:
* make right damage appear for mana bolt.

* Huge documentation update, after much more changes have been made.
* Changed some of the spell names, and spell tables, and spell
  listings for mage... Mage damages must be upped as well.

* real wands of wonder:
	* money creation, monster summoning, various mage/priest spells
	* various attack spells, etc.
* change wands of wonder to STAVES of wonder....

* new demon! The Nasty Pop Tart, and new demon unique: The Strawberry
Purple Pop Tart.
* new person unique: Toaster Strudel, Opposer of Pop Tarts

* new mage spell:
	Word of Stability: lvl 25, resist nexus for 20+1d50 turns

* high elves need to require less xp to go up levels, as they only
	start with see invis!

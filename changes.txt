
Bugs
* Quests should no longer repeat, at least it should be really unlikely now, this time for sure.
* Some effects of doomspells will no longer be activated with wands of spark!
* Wielding a 2-hander while wielding two weapons no longer deletes the weapon on the arm.
* Items which cure stunning no longer automatically identified (a fix in set_stun)
* Throwing now displays the ability to take the Oath of Iron properly
* Plasma Hounds gain IM_FIRE, as they're plasma breathers
* Turns now displayed in character screen
* Stores should now order items properly
* Fixed error in Oath of Iron martial art damage

Additional code cleanup by Christer Nyfält

Known Bugs
* Town graphics bug
* Game crash bug
* Jeweled mimics don't show up in recall properly until you kill them

Hopefully the first two of these are local to the SDL port, and therefore releasing a Windows port without SDL will clear these up for the time being.

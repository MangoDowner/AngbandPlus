4/02/04 - 4/20/04
Changes in Animeband 0.5.5:
- A VERY bad Magic Knight glitch fixed (if you hit level 50, weapon turns 
  into an umbrella.  Woo-hoo.  This won't happen anymore :))
- Magic Knights nerfed a bit.  I felt that they were too strong.
- Some people may have gotten an old changes.txt file.  In that case ignore
  the part about the Magic Knights.  The dice/sides DO evolve.
- Chi Warrior Powers finally correctly implemented.  I also nerfed them 
  a lot because they seem severely unbalanced.  They can't cook well
  either or wield shields.  Oh well, only time will tell.
- Mimics nerfed slightly.
- Some monsters can "blade catch" you.  MWAHAHAHAHA!
- Reduced required quests from 4 to just 2.  You must solve two quests
  and kill Lina for the stairs to appear to DL 100, if you're in quest
  mode.  Currently there are only 6 quests available..of course, this
  will change eventually.
- On the plus side, there's a new scroll called "Life Insurance".  Maybe 
  this will make the game a lot easier.
- Some new, most evil monsters :)
- Some new vaults

Todo:
- Use flags more often instead of ghetto code :)
- Implement a most evil AI....hopefully it'll be nastier than 4GAI.


9/08/03 - 4/02/04
Changes in Animeband 0.5.4:
- QUESTS!!
- Vending Machines and Ramen stands...oh my :)
- More tiles
- Decided to cancel the idea of respawning uniques for now.
  Had some odd trouble with this.
- Finally got rid of the useless load1.c 
- Magic Knight glitch fixed.  If you're loading an earlier version,
  just level up to the next 10n, and it'll be fixed from there.
- Sanjiyan new limit break: Raging Demon
- Bullets do a lot more damage (from people who shoot guns)
- Some new monsters
- Fixed a metal/mecha glitch
- Wrote a wilderness maker that combines the graph-like properties
  of Un with the customizability of ToME.  I had fun with this one ^_^
- "Wildernesses" are accessible by a Train Station, located at the top
  left of the town.  It costs 300 AU to board the train.
- Mechas no longer lose life for firing guns
- Mecha HP replaces player HP on the screen when you wield a mecha.
- New classes, Mimic and Chi Warrior.  Mimics can mimic whatever 
  monster is adjacent to them with the 'O' key.  Chi Warriors are 
  not allowed to use weapons, but get a punch bonus, and learn powers
  from parchments.  Once a power is learned, it can be swapped into 
  your knowledge queue for use at any time.
- Limit Break command changed to 'p'
- New command: Press CTRL-T to talk to people.
- New command: Press CTRL-B to give an item to someone.
- New command: Press CTRL-H to cook items.
- Student and Mimic transform state extended a bit longer.
- Updated docs to a degree
- Two types of games are available: Classical for the V lovers, and 
  Quest mode for people who like quests.  If you use an old version 
  savefile, it will default to Classical.
- Mecha repair scrolls are available.  However, they weigh 500 pounds.
  :)

Todo:
- Make some of the mimic powers less retarded
- Monster mana....anyone?
- Sort out the terrains and object list (get rid of that stupid "pit"
  glitch)
- Remap the controls so they're more intuitive (need to look at 
  the roguelike keyset)
- More tiles/monsters
- More quests, I guess.
- Implement AI....after Monster mana.

Changes in Animeband 0.5.2:

- Idiotic Paladin Glitch fixed
- Fixed *really* abusable Student glitch, so now Student transform is no longer instant.
  In exchange, student mana costs for the last two spells are lower.
- It is now pointless to enchant Magic Swords, as the to hit and to dam will be level
  dependent.
- Magic Knights toned down just slightly (probably not noticeable)
- Sky Dragon Student and Magic Knight glitch fixed.  The exp needed to level up is now 
  correct.
- Black Market may sell some strange food stuffs.  That is fine.  It will be part of an
  upcoming "Cooking" feature.
- Some new monsters added -> I am running out of ideas.  Suggestions welcome.
- Kamitori no longer spawn.

6/02/2002 - 5/23/2003
Changes in Animeband 0.5.0 (from Angband 2.9.3):

- New Sound FX
- Added new monsters and new and interesting artifacts.
- New Races with new resistances and stat bonuses/penalties
- New and hopefully interesting spells for mages (priest prayers remain untouched)
- Has its own version number and name ^_^
- A new meter system is implemented.  When you get max meter, you are allowed to "limit break"
  (or "super", whatever you want to call it).  Such supers are dependent on what race you are
  and usually have good effects.  When you have maximum meter, press 'Z' to super.
- A new fighting style system is implemented.  The groove system affects how you gain meter along with
  some other things (critical hits, dodges, parrys, etc.)
- You can get drunk in this game :))  Though, the effects aren't exactly good.
- Some uniques never die.
- Some monsters will hit you, regardless of what armor you're wearing.  There are monsters out
  there which I suggest you run from...

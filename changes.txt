DrAngband Changes:
------------------

DrAngband 2.9.1 (29/10/99)
--------------------------

* TM_CURSE upgraded to every 50 turns and nastified in other ways...

* Dragons get extra +hit and +dam bonuses.

* Invulnerability now halves damage. Name changed.

* No 100% safety from theft.

* Yeek racial power 'flee in terror' (Haste 5+d5, terror 5+d10).
  Pixie racial power 'throw pixie dust' (confuse monster).

* Other racial powers fail rate lowered.

* The One Ring Activation more powerful. Given invisibility, too.

* New artifact crown for dragons. It is TM_CURSED when used by non-dragons.

* Dragon's teeth and claws correctly shown in character dumps.

* Staves, wands and rods more powerful.

* Mages are useless with bows. Wands should be their bows.

* Rings of Confusion resistance (mostly for dragons).

* Invisibility shown as '*' in see_invis field.

* Mage spells 'Mana Bolt' and 'Resist Electricity'.

* [Some] Orcs can fire arrows. (Monster) Archery attacks marginally boosted.

* Resist light & dark on shadow cloaks.

* Bonus to digging for dragons.

* 'Amulet s' bug fixed.

* Default options saving feature.

* Keymap dump bug fixed.

* Chests usually drop good items.

* Detect doors now detects locked and jammed doors.

* Multi-hued Dragons: 4 basic resists, single, double, treble and quadruple
  resisted at levels 0, 25, 35 and 45 respectively.

* Race name now no longer overflows onto dungeon map with big names.

* Dragon attack message order corrected (Bite, Claw, Bite, Claw, ...)

* New main-gcu.c. (Whose?)

* Weapon skills: Stabbing, fencing, hafted and polearms. Implementation
  is transparent. Compare hobbit rogues using daggers with using maces
  or axes for a good example of the effects of this. Also priests with
  edged weapons or polearms.

* Priest -2 to hit,dam when using edged or polearms removed because the
  new weapon skills penalize *far* more realistically.

* Ring of Speed rarity and depth changed to prevent mid-game boredom.

* Fixed curse armour scrolls so they trash dragon's cloaks and not their
  first ring.

* Actual object quality boost to next level when offering stuff to the RNG!
  This can result in objects up to 40 levels out of depth when making
  particularly generous offerings.

* Fixed a 'bug' in the fake artifact names patch caused by over-running
  the normal 80 buffer.

* Faster ranger psuedo-id.

DrAngband 2.9.0c (28/10/99)
---------------------------

* 'O' is now 'Use racial power' on the rogulike keyset. Still 'U' on the normal
  one.

* ^O (Ctrl-O) is now 'Offer item to the RNG' on the roguelike. Still 'O' on the
  normal one.

DrAngband 2.9.0b (27/10/99)
---------------------------

* Fixed major bug in staff and wand stacking.


Angband 2.8.3 -> DrAngband 2.9.0 (Started 24/10/99)
---------------------------------------------------

* Player invisibility. INVIS (equipment) and SEE_INVIS (monster) flags added.
  (TR3_INVIS, RF2_SEE_INVIS).

* Artifact Arrows. 'Bard' and 'Hellblazer'.

* 25% breakage of arrows (from 50%).

* Immunities shown as *, temp resists shown as #.

* Amulets of the Magi now give intelligence instead of searching and a random
  high resistance.

* 1 Extra shot at level 30 for Warriors with any ranged weapons.

* Extra shots at levels 20 and 40 for Rogues with slings.

* Rings of poison resistance to depth 2000', rarity 3, value 12000 (from depth
  3000', rarity 2, value 16000).

* 'Elemental' rings activate for double resistance. Ring of Acid changed to
  Ring of Lightning.

* Globe of Invulnerability now only reduces damage (that reaches take_hit())
  to 1/3. Eg mana storm = 550hps / 3 = 183hps with the new globe.

* New TM_CURSE. Based on the TY_CURSE. It has a  1/TM_CURSE_CHANCE (100) chance
  of activation each turn. Effects range from draining experience and stats
  to summoning multiple ancient dragons, high undead, demons and uniques.
 
* Iron Helm of Gorlim, Two Handed Sword 'Mormegil' and weapons of morgul have
  gained the TM_CURSE.

* Leon Marrick's Oangband Rod stacking. Rod recharge times moved to pval field
  of k_info.txt.

* [Monster] Dragon melee damage massively increased.

* get_rnd_line() borrowed from Zangband.

* 'O' command offers items to the Random Number God (RNG). Note -- Artifacts can
   be offered and will disappear permenently if offered.
   Rng.txt, rng0-5.txt have the RNG responses.

* 4th spell book 'Genocide' spell changed to 'Plasma Storm', a 5 * plev damage
  radius 3 plasma ball. Level 37, cost 23 mana.

* Raal's Tomes spells considerably powered up.

* 'Fake' Artifact names can be created by inscribing items with #<artifact name>.
  Eg Longsword (2d5) (+9,+9) inscribed with @w0#'Ringil' will appear as
  a Longsword 'Ringil' (2d5) (+9,+9) {@w0}. This is a nice feature so you can
  name your non-artifacts (although it does work on artifacts. eg "The Glaive
  of Pain 'Tomthanc'".)

* OPT_testing_stack, OPT_testing_carry and OPT_alert_hitpoint options now on
  be default.

* Resist chaos no longer gives hidden resistance to confusion. All artifacts that
  previously gave resistance to chaos now give proper resistance to confusion also.

* Resistances accumulate. 

* All the old DrAngband races.

* Rings of sustaining and resistance.

* Dragon racial powers activated with 'U'. Code borrowed from Zangband.

* Priest spell 'Detect Traps' changed to 'Spiritual Hammer' and 'Detect Doors/Stairs'
  changed to 'Detect Doors/Traps' (although it also detects stairs.)

* Nice new powers give to *slay* ego items.

* Monsters from Drangband 2.0 (from zangband).

* Slays applied to total melee damage. Slays smaller for melee than from
  ranged attacks.

* "Show player by race" option to show dragons as Ds. Best used with "hilite
  player with the cursor" so you always know which D is you!



Changes from Angband 2.7.8b2 to old Drangband versions
------------------------------------------------------

Added new character races: 

Pixies (- str,con + dex,int +10speed, confusion attack)
Yeeks  (-5 to everything, but advance quickly)
Crystal Dragons (res shards, free action, shard bolt, extra +25 AC)
Copper Dragons (res dis, freeact, regen, dis ray)
Bronze Dragons (res conf, regen, conf bolt)
Brass Dragons (res sound, regen, stun bolt, BAD stealth!!!)
Psuedo Dragons (res light,dark,blind, regen, light ray)

All dragons also get resist fear and featherfall, a bonus to AC, can dig 
and fight without weapons, and instead of normal equipment carry an amulet, 
six rings, a light, a cloak, and a crown. They also (in general) have bad
stealth and horrible CHA, and (non-dragon) shopkeepers hate them.

Breath weapons and Pixilate use 'P'.

Deleted the mage spell of cure poison, and the priest spells of detect doors
and detect traps. Added mage spells cone of cold, lightning bolt (old lb
renamed to spark), wall of fire, ray of force, and resist lightning. Changed
spell damages. Added priest spells detect doors/traps and spiritual hammer.

Added about 40 new monsters.

Added rings of resistance and rings of sustaining.

Added a few empty mineral veins

Fixed a nasty artifact bug. I think.

------
Changes from Drangband 2.0

Changed hp/spells/mana per level to use tenth points rather than half points.

Added my favorite little Golden Retrievers. :)

Added resist poison to the list of higher resists, and feather fall to lower.

Added random higher resists to amulets of the magi. Added resist poison to 
Defenders. Added fire immunity to Slay Demon. Added possible stat bonuses to 
the other crappy ego-weapons.

Changed the roguelike key for breath weapons to 'O' (so it can actually be 
used).

Extended the blows table to give 7 or 8 attacks for VERY high str/dex.

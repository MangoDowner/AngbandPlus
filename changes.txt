    - Protected zones have no vaults or destroyed levels

    - Level 26 has Satan, do not bother him, or in other words do no let him kill you
    - Levels after 26 have no creatures of before level 26

code changes : for testing purposes, since there is no more flagging code for wizards,
there can be either only all wizards or no wizards, right now every player is a wizard 
unless this game is released. So to all that want to wizard around, check file birth.c
and set 	debug_mode = TRUE; and compile. All wizards know how to compile ;)


Bugs
* Quests should no longer repeat, at least it should be really unlikely now, this time for sure.
* Some effects of doomspells will no longer be activated with wands of spark!
* Wielding a 2-hander while wielding two weapons no longer deletes the weapon on the arm.
* Items which cure stunning no longer automatically identified (a fix in set_stun)
* Throwing now displays the ability to take the Oath of Iron properly
* Plasma Hounds gain IM_FIRE, as they're plasma breathers
* Turns now displayed in character screen
* Stores should now order items properly
* Harder quests should now be harder, and getting quest monsters that are deeper than expected will net fewer of them
* Stair creation will only create down staircases for ironman characters
* 'C'haracter screen changed slightly, now correctly displays cancelled flags, and emphasizes immunities.  Temporary resists are also included.
* Burgling an item should now report the correct quantity of items recieved.  This may do funny things to items that change names when they are in your inventory.
* Mushrooms should sometimes break in traps now.
* Metamorphasis will no longer leave you with a very strange number of hitpoints (error introduced in unofficial version).
* Heroism will now always cancel fear.

Gameplay changes
* Martial arts rewritten; now they have flexible numbers of blows, critical like melee weapons, use deadliness (karate uses dexterity) and give different bonuses (wrestling gives str, hp, tunnel; karate gives dex, speed, and stealth).  Damage should be a little higher than it was.
** Now, with extra blows for real
* Cap on melee skills now eliminated from casters -- now instead, it is reduced by a fraction (1/3 for oathed, 1/6 for non).  For priests it is 1/6 for blugeoning, 1/2 for sharp, and for paladins it is no reduction for blugeoning and 1/3 for sharp.
* Device penalty is now 33% for Oath of Iron characters
* Worn (non-artifact) equipment is now easier to activate

* Perception grants infravision to make shadowstalkers more playable (at 10, 30, 50 and 70)
* Oathbound burglars get "Darkness" talent (mapped to "[-")
* Oathbound Burglars pick locks, chests, disarm, and use devices just fine in the dark
* Infravision maps interesting terrain

* Narya, Nenya given more personality
* Rings of Ice, Fire, Electricity, Acid, and Venom now have EASY_KNOW -- this way their resistances will show up on character screen properly, and since they're never cursed, it shouldn't be a big deal.
* Give Tuor invisibility flag, reduce pval to 3; give Luthein invisibility flag
* Mushrooms of Metamorphasis will no longer always change race after first use, though it will happen more often than with first consumption.

* Decrease Oath of Iron requirement to 25, and slingers get it at the same point as everyone else
* Penalty to skills starts at power - 10, rather than (power - 8) * 8 / 10
* Light Sources of Darkness added (useful for shadowstalkers), cursed lanterns less common.
* Allowed for gauntlets to have slays and brands which should apply to martial arts attacks.  Brands now show up on the paur* gauntlets.
* No longer gain XP for casting new spells (it's like learning the entire second book at once)
* Power of a brand increases with skill -- damage bonus ranges from 1/3 to 3/2 the previous value
* Scale mana/HP when changing wielded objects
* Stores show their investment

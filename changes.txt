Portralis 0.5 alpha 2.2.

CHANGES
---------


Gameplay:

- Three classes are back: Priest, Bard and Elemental Lord. They have almost
  been entirely redone, and they play out differently that they did in 0.4.
  So be sure to try them out!
- Music has been tweaked for 0.5. Overall, Charisma cost has been increased,
  but the Bard class has plently of Charisma-enhancing abilities, so everything
  should work out.
- Charisma and stores discounts works differently. In the previous version,
  it was a fixed reduction that could eventually reach 100%, and was applied
  to everything, except high end items, like scrolls of instant leveling.
  (in other words, it didn't apply to what you'd want charisma for...)
  Now, the way it works is that it compares your Charisma to the item's depth
  level to get a reduction. You need more Charisma to get a good discount on
  high level items than you need for low level ones, but it can now work on
  any items. The early game benefits of Charisma should now be much more
  visible and significant. However, to get a significant discount on the
  scroll of instant item leveling, you will need a LOT of Charisma, and you
  probably won't have much choice but to use the Bardic Reputation ability
  to help you out.
- An old relic of 0.4 made Magic Blocking counters of enemies MUCH less
  effective than Melee and Ranged blocking ones, because Magic Defense was
  still lowering the chance of countering. This has been removed, so don't
  be surprised if high level enemies blocks your spells more often!


Bugs fixed:

- Fixed an issue with high level boss monsters that caused an infinite loop
  and crashed the game. Happened frequently at dungeon levels 60+.

Known bugs:

- Unfortunately, the crashes issues for self-projections(potions, effect songs,
  water, lava, etc...) are not completely fixed. I've still encountered a few
  intermitently. Just when I thought I finally had a save with the crash,
  attempts at debugging it have been futile. The crash goes away with irrelevant
  changes to the code, like adding a debug message, and comes back when taken
  out... for a while. Then they all went away. I wonder if it's some kind of
  memory addressing issue, or something with the way the lua files are
  processed... in any cases, this one remains a mystery. Feel free to post save
  files that you have with the bug, and I'll take a look at them.

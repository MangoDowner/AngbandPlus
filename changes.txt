05/04/1999
- Fixed a bug in the Weyr of Arda at Lothlorien
- Add the artifact's descriptions made by ... well I don't have his/her name.
  Anyway, great work.
- The rings of teleportation can now be activated but they'll be destroyed in
  the process. It's like a last chance option :)

08/04/1999
- The uniques used in the special levels are no longer shown as killed in the
  list and can only be created in the special level.
  Note : This will only affect the new characters.
- Fixed : When a Power Mage spell fails it is not cast anyway.
- Wall creation works for Power Mage
- Divia wrote some missing artifact descriptions

12/04/1999
- Reimplemented the engraving feature. There are some parchments in the
  dungeon which contain Adunaic/Quenya/Sindarin/... words you can use to
  engrave the floor with 'x'(']' in the roguelike keyset). You must read them
  before engraving even if you know the words from your last game. Also the
  inscription is magical and so needs some mana to work. So there is a new
  and unique feature : each grid in the dungeon have some mana on it's own.
  You can sense the mana of one grid by pressing 'X'('[' in the roguelike
  keyset), but this is not very precise nor easy, it's based on the magical
  ability. When an inscription is used it decrease the grid's mana and when
  there is not enough mana the inscription don't work anymore. The maximum
  mana of each grid is 255. i.e.: when you engrave the protection inscription
  which use 8 mana on a grid with 80 mana, a monster won't be able to walk on
  it for 80/8=10 turns, but well, this can save your life !
  Note : There are not a lot of inscriptions, if you have some ideas, don't
  hesitate, email me !

14/04/1999
- Changes in the r_info for the HAS_EGG flag as suggested by Akhronath
- Bloodletters of Khorne only have a 20% chance of dropping Blade of Chaos

17/04/1999
- Raal's Tomes of Destruction have a 20% chance of dropping a Raal's Tome of
  Destruction
- Symbiants are more likely to receive the grow molds mutation

20/04/1999
- Quest monsters can not be pets or breeders
- Can now place Trees(T), Mountain(M), Shallow & Deep lava(l, L) and
  Shallow & Deep water(w, W) in the special levels
- Add a new dungeon type: The lost city of Numenor which is mainly composed
  of water and which can be found to the west of Bree
********************* IMPORTANT *************************
- The savefile from the old versions of PernAngband are no longer compatible
  with the new one. It's mainly due to the new magic system but also some other
  changes. I'm sorry but this would be hard to write a converter since all
  the realm change (they have more spells) and so the books too and also the
  way to remember which spells are known, forgotten, tried...
*********************************************************

22/04/1999
- Some new graphics from Andreas Koch
- Fixed the wilderness generation bug which sometimes hung the computer when
  trying to go on a wilderness border
- The features(in f_info.txt) have some flags now. This allows me to create 2
  new types of wall: The Glass walls which you can see through but that you
  can't pass and the Illusion walls that you can pass but not see through
- The screen is now correctly redrawn when leaving/entering a body
- Add the Wands of Wall Creation
- Death Mold powers have moved to the activation command('U')

24/04/1999
- Your are no longer crushed when flying over trees/mountain without being a
  DragonRider
- The Vanilla feelings are back

26/04/1999
- All the spellbooks are now placed on the top of the inventory.
- The Sorcerors can now use the Wizard and Prior books
- The new magic system is ready. I'm just waiting for Akhronath and Shawn
  Cheng. And now adding a new realm or an old fashioned magic system is
  performed the same way and easily
- Add the Illusionists from Kangband. Someone has asked for them so... :)

28/04/1999
- Finished the Valarin Realm
- Between gates are now allowed in the vaults. To place them place 2 times a
  number from 0 to 7. I.e.(from weisiger <jmartin@inreach.com>):
  D:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  D:#,,,,,X&...@X..**&X....9X
  D:#...&1X.,,,2X..**&X3...9X
  D:#...&.X1,,,.X2.**3X....9X
  D:#,,,,,X&...@X..**&X....9X
  D:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  But BEWARE ! You MUST put the 2 occurrences of the number, no check are done
  so it'll surely crash or bug if not ! You've been warmed.
- You can now walk over the water with a Valarin spell

30/04/1999
- A monster on a between gate when the player is using the other is teleported
  to the player location
- Add some Between vaults from weisiger
- Added the Sigaldry realm
- The Rings and Amulets are now allowed to be random artifacts
- You can use the between gates in the special levels via the numbers 4,5,6,7,
  8,9,0
- Alchemists MUST wear gloves (no cesti nor gauntlets) in order to do alchemy.
  They also begin the game with some gloves
- Add a Potion of Learning which allow you to learn one more spell than you
  normally can. No need to say that they are very rare
- The more you learn spells in a realm the more efficient with that realm
  you are

02/05/1999
- Implemented the Nether Realm

09/05/1999
- Magical stair at the bottom of each dungeon
- Reworked the imprinted pet system, now it will work lot better
- Add the scrolls of spell which can cast a spell like a book. They must be
  created by the Sigaldry magic, they can't be randomly generated
- Updated the Sigaldry realm
- Added Staves of Wishing! You can wish for objects, monsters, spells but
  NOT FOR ARTIFACTS nor for staves of wishing
- Flying monsters can now pass over trees and mountains

11/05/1999
- The game will ask you to choose ammo from your inventory if your quiver is
  empty

26/05/1999
- Add the Crusade Realm
- Add some new inscriptions
- It's now possible to add up to 32 realms

03/06/1999
- Wraith form is less powerful since it's not so rare. Now damage is only
  divided by 5 and armor raised by 50

05/06/1999
- Add the speaking patch from Matt Graham. Just edit the monspeak.txt file
  to add new entries. And don't hesitate to send me what you've added !

11/06/1999
- There are fewer gods and each god has one or two preferred races and if one of
  this race pray to him they gain better benefits. Also the praying effects
  are more differentiated (based on the different gods)
- Add the 'only once' quest type
- It's harder to please your deity
- The Nazguls are MUCH more powerful (ideas from Akhronath):
  ******** Quote from Akhronath mail ********
  All weapons which are not ego-items cannot harm them, and will be destroyed if
  the character hits a Nazgul with it. Ego-items which have slay evil or slay
  undead can harm them, but each hit has a 25% chance of destroying the weapon.
  Other ego-items can't damage them, and have the same 25% chance of
  destruction. An artifact weapon will be able to hit them only if the weapon
  has slay evil or undead, but the weapon will be hit with disenchantment every
  time it connects (but this is negated with disenchantment resistance on the
  character). And even these artifacts can be destroyed, although there's only a
  5% chance. Other artifacts, of course, can't damage the Nazgul, and still have
  the 5% destruction chance.

  When a character does any damage to a Nazgul or is damaged by a Nazgul, he has
  a 25% chance of being afflicted by the Black Breath. Thenceforth the character
  will slowly be drained of experience and sanity. The character can stay alive
  by using restoring and curing potions, but to cure the Black Breath he must
  either drink a Potion of Life or eat (a new item) Athelas Leaf. (Athelas isn't
  really eaten, of course, but I can't think of another simple way to implement
  it.)

  This will really make the player think twice before going up to a Nazgul, and
  makes it very useful to carry spare weapons.
  *******************************************
  So if you encounter a Nazgul .... RUN AWAY !
- Sensing the grid's mana is now done by pressing 'x' key to engrave the floor
  The X key is free for some new function (maybe for the new riding system)

17/06/1999
- When browsing the spells while being a Power Mage there are no more bugs
  when pressing escape
- Removed the forbidden race/class combination feature. But it's always
  possible to recompile PernAngband with it with the FORBID_BAD_COMBINAISON
  define(in config.h)
- New god : The RNG

19/06/1999
- The priest/prior/paladin's god is now chosen dependent on their race
- I have enough of hunting those damn ghost bug which makes them unable to
  move. So it's now a feature ! They don't move because they are GREAT
  adventurers who now just want to stand there to find peace :)
  Hey, fixing bugs is easy this way :))

22/06/1999
- When 'A'ctivating the first screen showed is the equipment and no more the
  inventory
- Some new gfx drew by Andreas Koch

06/07/1999
- You can place object kind in the special levels instead of artifacts by
  using 1000+k_idx as the number instead of just the artifact index

17/07/1999
- Add the Yeek race, but not as in Zangband. It's the one from Drangband.
  I was thinking of a race who advance even quicker than the humans in levels
  since a long time and I've found it !
  So they suffer lots of disadvantages but need less exp than the other
races, i.e.: When a DragonRider comes to level 2 a Yeek can already be at
  level 7 !!
- Added the FLY attribute, it allows you to fly over trees and mountains
  because it's no longer possible with the levitation one. It's also a lot
  rarer since it's POWERFUL in Galgals and Mirkwood. DragonRiders have it
  by default. There is also a change in the features flags, CAN_LEVITATE
  means that you can just avoid them by floating over it (like a pit,
  water, ...) and CAN_FLY means that you must have the FLY flag to cross it.

19/07/1999
- The monster's drop are now created at the same time as the monster is
  created. First it disallows scumming of monster drops. And the most
  important thing is that it will allow me to add the new ability of stealing
  objects from monsters (everyone will be able to do it, but only Rogue will
  be excellent at it). For the point of view of the player there is no change.
  It may produce some strange object disappearance in the late game since
  all the objects are generated with the dungeon. And thus it may need to
  increment the maximum size of o_list in misc.txt. If such problems shows
  up, email me.
- Press 'Z'('[' in roguelike mode) to STEAL an item from a monster. The
  success rate is based on your dexterity, the fact that you are or aren't
  a Rogue (being one makes it easier), the weight of the object to steal and
  the base level of the monster. A Rogue will also gain some experience
  if he/she succeeds. This made them more Rogue and less Warriors.

22/07/199
- Add more graphics from Andreas Koch along with a new version of the editor

26/07/1999
- The resurrection effect of the gods is now harder to get and decreases a lot
  more your grace. It was ... well ... too powerful for the cost of some
  crappy artifacts
- Finished the Magery realm created by Chris Weisiger (jmartin@inreach.com)

03/08/1999
- I've finally fixed it ! You know, this ugly bug that disallows the darkening
  of the grass & mud tiles when they have been lit.

18/08/1999
- Yeah ! It's done! The new magic system is finished (I will add Spirit Realm
  later). The final form is 4 Major Realms : Valarin, Nether, Magery, Shadow
  and 4 Minor Realms : Crusade, Tribal, Sigaldry, Illusion.
  The only problem is be that it could be unbalanced, especially the
  Shadow realm since I've created it :)
  Anyway it should be great. There are still a lot of old spells but some new
  coloured funny spells for you to discover, as Control the Ring, Infuse Amulet,
  Scribe Scroll, Doppleganger, Volcano Flow, Tidal Wave, and a lot of others!
  The max number of spells a character can learn depends on his class. But
  generally the player can learn fewer spells than the total number of spells he
  has in all the books he can read.
  I want to thank Akhronath (who has the first idea and who write some realms),
  Shawn Cheng, Chris Weisiger and DSCreamer<DSCreamer@aol.com> for their great
  help.
- Moldoux can not appear at any other level than level 1

21/08/1999
- A new version of the Tile Editor plus a full set of graphs (expect the books)!
- Moved the dungeon types definitions from tables.c to a new info file in the
  lib directory: d_info.txt
  It allows you to add new dungeon types easily.
  There is also a brand new feature: You can specify which monster flags that
  are NEEDED for a monster to be generated in the dungeon.
  There is also an addition of dungeon flags. Here is the structure:
  N:<index>:<name>
  D:<long name>
  W:<min depth>:<min depth>:<min player level>:<next dungeon>:<flags mode>:<min alloc>:<max alloc chance>
  L:<floor1>:<%1>:<floor2>:<%2>:<floor3>:<%3>
  A:<wall1>:<%1>:<wall2>:<%2>:<wall3>:<%3>:<outer wall>:<inner wall>
  F:<flags>
  M:<monster flags>
  S:<monster spells>
- The quest rewards are always good
- I've finally found and fixed the Mirkwood Spiders Quest

24/08/1999
- Add the MAZE flag to the dungeon type flag list, which instead of a normal
  dungeon generate a full big maze ! And it's EVIL ! Note that there will be
  no rooms and no vaults generated, just a plain evil maze
  The algorithm is from <Pierre.Bru@spotimage.fr> on rec.games.roguelike.development
- Note about the dungeons : A dungeon can't have more than 40 levels
- You can use SMALLEST, SMALL and BIG as dungeon flags to specify the level's
  size
- 6 new dungeon types: a Graveyard, an Illusory Castle, an Orc cave, a Maze
  a Dragon's Lair and A Forest with specific gfxs and monsters restrictions
- Some new gfx form Andreas Koch mostly to add more flavor to the towns

29/08/1999
- You can add a guardian and a guardian artifact to each dungeons types with
  the following flags: FINAL_ARTIFACT_artifact_number and
  FINAL_GUARDIAN_guardian_number

29/08/1999 - PernAngband 4.0.0

01/09/1999
- Fixed the max_dlv non allocation error
- Fixed the Tribal realm spell descriptions

01/09/1999 - PernAngband 4.0.0b
- New dungeon type, the Netherworld with Muar and the Wand of Fireball of
  Mithrandir at the bottom
- You can't gain a fate before being level 10
- Some cosmetic changes suggested by Akhronath
- A new Artifact by Akhronath, The Long Sword of Murazor 4d5, so ... the next
  time you see a long sword 4d5, beware ...

05/09/1999
- Add a feature flag to allow running
- Fixed the Chaos Warriors bug (they were unable to use magic !)
- Fixed the Chaos Realm descriptions
- You can't rest on a between gate
- You can now steal from stores. But beware of the consequences if you fail...
- Fixed a bug in that when recalling to the town the player was sometimes
  placed in the upper left corner

08/09/1999
- Fixed a bug that disallowed the creation of entrances to some vaults

14/09/1999
- Fixed the Dragon Tower bug
- Add minimum player level to the random dungeons
- Add shafts, you can use them do go up/down for up to 4 levels(but you can't
  ignore quest levels). Original patch from Static Chaos. Idea from GSN
- Add a dungeon flags to forbid generation of doors

27/09/1999
- Some tweaks to the possessor code as written by Static Chaos i.e:
  You must possess a monster that is able to open to door to do so. The
  same applies to bashing. Your sex is modified by your body. Lots of tweaks
  to the spells that can be used...
- The racial power of the Dwarves is now the same as The Pick of Erebor
  activation: they can find hidden passage in the walls
- There is 1 chance in 10 that the level is an magical level, which means that
  each grid will contain more mana than a normal level.
- Add some new sentences to the monsters sentence lists

04/10/1999
- Began to add the Druid class. But it's TOTALLY different from the other
  variant's Druids. They make intense use of the mana flow from within the
  earth and the elements, thus their spells can regenerate the mana they have
  used by pumping it from the floor, like the Tunnel spell which will blink
  the player and will try to absorb enough mana form the grid he/she lands on.
  They can also (and they are the only to be able to do that) regenerate the
  mana flow of the earth. They also can use enhanced attack types called
  Druidic Bolt/Beam/Ball that can follow a mana flow laid by the player.
- The Druids can sense precisely the amount of mana of a grid

08/10/1999
- Added some revised graphics by Andreas Koch
- Added the code provided by Alexey Guzeev(aga@russia.crosswinds.net) to
  compile PernAngband under OS/2 with EMX
- It's finally fixed ! the damn bug that was crashing the game when leaving
  a town on certain system (Mac and Windows) ! this will never happen again !

27/10/1999
- Finished the Druid class. They have 40 spells (8 * 5 books). The spells that
  activate Mana Runes is not active for now, but it will in a near future.
- Add a slightly modified Tom Morton fake artifact patch (it won't print {} at
  the end)

30/10/1999
- You can inscribe an object with !! to notify the player when it's recharged
- Lots of bug fixes thanks to Lothar Lange <100644.2004@compuserve.com>
- Lots of new ideas thanks to Lothar Lange <100644.2004@compuserve.com>

30/10/1999 - PernAngband 4.0.1
- "Foolish mortal! Thou hast not pleased me! I'll doom your game with the new
  horrible DG curse !"
  Yes I've done it, the DG curse is even worse than the TY one. One of it's
  most perverse feature is that it can replicate itself to contaminate sane
  objects that can't be cured. Also if you remove the curse of a DG cursed
  object, it will recurse itself automatically !
  Beware of the horrible Long Sword of Murazor because it carries the ancient
  morgothian curse !
  Oh, there are also some monsters that give the DG Curse when dying ... but
  I'll let you find whose they are by yourself :-<|>  (Dark God makes an evil
  smile). I can just say one thing : you should *REALLY* *NOT* kill Mathilde...
  But do not worry she's got much more HP, so you can't kill her anymore :)

01/11/1999
- Add the Rod of Home Summoning, which acts like the old dragon spells
  "Call Home"

08/11/1999
- Drastically reduced the recharging time of the Dragon Scale mails in order
  to render them useful.
- Added a new weapon ego-item: of Spinning, which will make you spin around
  in order to hit every monster around you. Note that you'll only get one
  blow for each monsters whatever your normal number of blow is.
- Added (ok stolen) the question in the GSNband FAQ about wrists hurting (it can
  be useful, so everyone should know)
- Rogues and monks gain more and more stealth as they gain levels (SBF)
- Added some sentences for the Dwarves (in monspeak.txt)
- Added the support of two-handed weapons (from GSN). Thus there are weapons
  that can be handled with two or one hand (but with one hand it halves the
  damage). A 2 handed weapon can't be wielded with a shield.
- Added the random character name generation from Cthangband
- Added rivers (water & lava) from the Steven Fuerst fractal patch. Note that
  you have to add WATER_RIVER, LAVA_RIVER, WATER_RIVERS or LVA_RIVERS to a
  dungeon to have some rivers generated (actually in Mordor(lava), Dragon lair
  (Lava) and Forest(Multiple Water))
- Updated generate.c to the Steven Fuerst fractal patch room generator (using
  room_alloc), in order to implement the remaining part of the patch easier.
  But I'm still having problems adapting it to my extended dungeon generator.
- Ahah ! I've resolved the problem !! there are now fractal rooms (15%, can be
  always enabled by specifying the CAVE flag), now the orc caves looks great

10/11/1999
- Added the Caverns(enabled via the CAVERN flag)
- Hell has been moved down, it now begins at level 666! :)

12/11/1999
- Add the Static Chaos persistent dungeon patch that save every level of a
  dungeon (which has the PERSISTENT flag) on disk and reload it instead of
  regenerating a new level.
- Add the Outer World dungeon type (this is an entrance to a place of an
  incredible stability). It use the PERSISTENT flag and thus will be saved.
  Only level 50 characters can go there to prevent abuse(like have an old
  ultra powerful character and a new one and going into the Outer World to
  exchange some stuff). And yes the saved dungeons are the same for EVERY
  characters. But to add ... err ... variety,  I've put it from level 300 to
  305, I've put it to have at least 30 monsters from the beginning AND to have
  an higher monster generation rate(1/60 instead of 1/160 !), thus you'll
  NEVER get bored there :)
- Implemented the much more complex trap system from Angband/64 thanks to the
  patch made by Static Chaos. There is 169 traps (see tr_info.txt).
  Beware that on average the traps are deadlier...
- It comes along with a new feature for stat system: temporary stat drain,
  it's cool

14/11/1999
- Renamed Power Batteries to Essences
- The DG_CURSE can put the NEVER_BLOW flag on a weapon ... sadistic !!!

16/11/1999
- DSMs now have been granted the FLY flag

19/11/1999
- The monster memory now colors some important things about the monster (like
  resists, speed, ...)
- Fixed a wand of wishing bug, that made them sometimes NOT use a charge
- Moved the special level DeathWatch to the Orc Cave
- Moved the special level Treasure Room to the Maze so people are forced
  to play those dungeons if they want the artifacts
- Random quests will only occurs on PRINCIPAL dungeons (the one created by
  splitting the vanilla dungeon into 4 smaller ones, Galgals, Mirkwood,
  Mordor and Angband itself)
- To prevent too many YASD from the DG curse of Mathilde she has now been
  granted 22500 hp, but as usual she can't attack :))
- Fixed a bug that disabled the guardian at the bottom of some dungeons

25/11/1999
- Added main-gcu from Angband/64 to allow larger screens
- Added the new note command that dumps to a file from "Tom Morton"
  <tmorton@yikesstation.freeserve.co.uk>

27/11/1999
- Added funny time message from Z
- Added object experience as suggested by Ceilti <Ceilti@aol.com>
- Fixed a bug when the magestaves were cursed

29/11/1999
- Added the small trees (along with a new feature flag: SUPPORT_LIGHT) to
  replace the walls in the Forest and Mirkwood
- Some new gfx from Andreas, and the town of Bree with the new tiles

02/12/1999
- Add 4 dungeons by variaz@hotmail.com: Vanilla Dungeon(only from Vanilla Town,
  The Small Water Cave, The Sacred Land Of Mountains(if you don't fly ...
  do not even plan on going there),
  The Wild Land Of Kurukar(It sure looks great)

04/12/1999
- New dungeon flags: HOT and COLD that affect object decay
- Add YA*IF (Yet Another *_info File): wt_info.txt
  It defines wilderness features *, allowing a better wilderness map. Since
  it now defines nearly everything a wilderness need to have, the map itself
  only have to be an array of feature and seed, thus allowing a much bigger
  wilderness. I also plan to have a Omega wilderness mode where you can have
  an overview of the wilderness to travel quicker (but time will pass much
  quicker too:)
  The structure of w_info is also changed, it's uglier but well .... :)
  The wilderness size must be EXACTLY the same as the size defined in misc.txt.

06/12/1999
- Scrolls of Reset Recall are now WORKING !!!!!
- The new wilderness mode is done ! When you reach the border of a wilderness
  screen you go to the small scale wilderness map, where you can see all
  the wilderness map with the towns/dungeons/... A lot of commands are
  disabled there and moving takes MUCH more time, so beware of the food !
  You can enter the big scale mode by pressing > (this allow you to enter towns)
  NOTE: The Death Molds CAN'T reach the small scale mode because their
  erratic movements are impossible to handle in such a scale.
  BEWARE: Your imprinted pets WON'T follow you in the wilderness !!!

11/12/1999
- Add wilderness encounters
- Add Oangband rod/wand stacking
- Amulets of the Serpent from Sadi Khan <sadik@christa.unh.edu>:
  Resist Poison, Dexterity, some AC and Poison breathing

12/12/1999 - PernAngband 4.0.5

18/12/1999
- Updated the makefiles and renamed object3.c to traps.c
- Add 5 new essences from Sadi Khan: Force, Darkness, Lightning, Mana and
  Knowledge
- Fixed the bug that was placing the player at the town entrance when
  leaving a building

20/12/1999
- Add the tool slot. It's actually only used to wield a shovel/pick but I've
  some plans for it
- You can only dig walls if you use a shovel/pick in your tool slot

24/12/1999
- Removed the player ghosts, well in fact made them a compile-time option(see
  config.h)

26/12/1999
- Added the Necromancer class. But again not quite the same as you've seen
  before. They can't be killed as easily as the other class. In fact when
  their HP comes to 0 they don't die but become undead for a while. While
  being undead their HP is replaced by DP(Death Points) that have a max
  inferior to the max HP and that are slowly decreasing(1 DP less each turn).
  They can use all the healing spells/potions/... but this won't stop them
  from being reduced again. The only way for them to come back in the world
  of the living is to kill 2 * player_level monsters.

01/01/2000
- Happy New Year !

02/01/2000
- Add a new curse(as suggested by LucFrench@aol.com). When a weapon has this
  curse and that the wielder attacks a monster with it, it can clone it !
  And it's REALLY REALLY annoying, especially when fighting some kinds of
  wyrms :)

10/01/2000
- Finally fixed the flags shown on the character display.
- The quit without save command(CTRL + L) is now a compile time option disabled
  by default
- The Necromancer class now has 5 spells (used the same way as the mindcrafter
  powers)

17/01/2000
- Power gained by levelling artifacts has been reduced
- New unique monster: The Greater Lag Monster... beware :)
- AHAHHAHAH ! I got it ! the wilderness bug that made the game crash when
  entering a town is fixed ! And the wilderness system has been greatly
  improved.
  Now to switch the wilderness mode, just press < or >.
  Everything should now works properly

16/02/2000
- Each Nazgul will now drop his Ring of Power. They are randomly generated
  and thus they don't appear in a_info.txt. They always give invisibility,
  life draining and are heavy cursed.

21/02/2000
- Changed the format of w_info.txt again, it's much more readable now.
  I also added a additional parameter to the W lines of wf_info to define
  which letter will be used in w_info.txt
- 60x20, this is the scale of the new wilderness, it tries to looks like
  the 3rd age middle earth map. Thus some dungeons leaved the towns they
  were used to be to join their "real" place on the map. Only the Upper
  Reaches of Galgals are still reachable from Bree.

24/03/2000
- Added a small hack from Static chaos to allow running faster with the

  not the dungeons. one file for each level named dun$dungeon$.$level$
  In it you can have some declarations, like B:dungeontype which will
  create a stairway to an other dungeon, thus allowing to have "branches"
  in the dungeons.
  L:dungeontype and L:level specify which is the "father" dungeon and at which
  level the stair appear.
  S:ext means to save the level(and thus to reload it) in the player.ext file

- Fixed the mountain bug that hung the game when entering mountain chains

  Static Chaos. That brings the number of monsters to ... 1023 !

  damage and so on
- Greater Hell Beasts now have .. 1 hp :)

11/07/2000
- Add the Unbeliever class, they are anti magicians. Great warriors, they
  have the worst magic device skill of all the classes, they continuously
  generate an anti-summoning field around them disabling monsters from
  summoning. The radius of the field increase with levels. After level 20
  they can also disrupt the magic continuum, thus getting the same effects
  as Anti-Magic, Anti-Tele and The Stone of Lore(nobody on the level can
  teleport)

13/07/2000
- Add an option to auto tunnel walls when bumping into them.
  NOTE that it'll ALWAYS take a turn then, so beware...
- Really fixed the note taking bug (ok stole the fix from Zangband :) )
- Changed the object description so now it's "Smeagol's Corpse" instead of

- Word of Destruction is no longer allowed in quests
- Add a fate spoiler created by Dustin Ragan
- Removed the old new player ghosts implementation
- Added the new old player ghost implementation (stolen from Drangband)
- Rod system have been totally reworked. Now you can find "base" rods without
  power (rods of nothing) with a certain quality (wooden, iron, ...) on which
  depends the amount of mana they contain. You can also find rod tips which
  contain the real spells but cannot be activated alone. You must attach (with
  the 'z' command) a rod tip to a base rod before using it. The spells of the
  different rod tips need different amounts of mana (so illumination is less
  mana-hungry than healing) :). You can also have base rods ego-items (artifacts
  soon) that can decrease the mana cost of the spell, increase the capacity
  of the rod, decrease the time needed to zap the rod, ...
  Oh BTW, you should be eager to get an Adamantite Rod of Healing of the
  Istari :)
  Now rods will hopefully be useful.
  Note that you have to identify the base rod to get the mana indicator
- Note files are now playername.nte instead of playername.txt
So if you want your note file to be carried to the next version you'd better
  rename it :)
- Fixed a bug that prevented Azog from being generated at the bottom of the Orc
  Caves

07/08/2000
****************** IMPORTANT *****************

  weight to the executable (and thus to the archive), was mainly unused,

  and thus ... it's better :)

  and the other 70% it can be cured via restore stats pots. The damage is now
  always 50d50 and is no longer affected by mage staves of spell
- Tribal spell "Meditate" no longer hastes/heals you
  (it still heals your sanity) and the glyphs' radius have been decreased

  Idea from Iain

- Elder Aranea HP reduced
- Small trees are burned by fire
- Randomly activated mutations are no longer activated in the overview
  wilderness
- Ghoulkings are now z instead of p

- Reduced mutation chance of breeders from 7% to 3%

03/09/2000
- New, unified store/building code

08/09/2000
- Add quest plots. Feature 75, 76, 77, 78 are now permanent walls but used
  as quest plot info holders. Before the new building code quest info was
  stored in the building feature but now all stores/buildings use the same
  feature(74) and the "special" value defines them.
- Add semi-random towns. Now if the ' ' (space) character is used in the town
  definition this grid will be replaced by the feature calculated by the
  plasma generator as if it was a normal wilderness screen. So the forest of
  Lothlorien is plasma generated and not fixed. It add variety and consistency
  with the rest of the wilderness

  Legs and arms mimicry will "create" a new body part (or some) for a certain
  duration. Wall mimicry will make the caster able to walk in walls (he becomes
  a wall) but ONLY in walls .. not on floor .. so beware with this one

27/09/2000

- Gods now need more sacrifices

- The Sandworm Queen will now drop the Sandworm armour when killed

03/02/2001
- Now you can separate a dungeon entrance from a dungeon exit on the
  wilderness map using the WILD_ix_iy__ox_oy flag in d_info.txt.
  ix, iy are the coordinates on the wilderness map of the entrance.
  ox, oy are the coordinates of the exit.
  Note that each of them(entrance and exit) must have a physical entrance
  on the wilderness map(that is a line in w_info.txt).
  When you use the entrance to enter you get to the first level but when you
  use the exit to enter you get to the last level.
  So now you can have dungeons that create shortcuts in the map.
  Or even allow to go in previously unreachable places(like now the dungeon
  of Moria allows you to reach a secret valley in the Mountains of the Moria
  which allow getting to some other dungeons)
- Fixed a bug with fountains (yeah, fountains of the Blood of Life were quite
  unbalancing :)
- Priests can't use Tribal magic anymore
- Mages can't use Crusade & Illusion Magic anymore
- Rogues can't use Crusade anymore

05/02/2001
- Found why under certain circumstances forbidden objects could still be
  generated (and that's also fixed now :) )
- Dungeons & Monsters can now have object themes (yeah I know, I stole that
  from Zangband, though the dungeon theme was in my head for long, but
  when I steal I do admit it ...)
  For example The Sandworm lair is really full of magical items, while the
  Orc Caves are more on the side of the weapons & armors. And the Dragon Lair
  is filled with ... oh well everything :) and so on.
  So it's now really worth to get out of the 4 basic dungeons and see the
  wild world!
  All dungeons are done with the themes, it could take a bit longer for
  the (1031) monsters... :)
  NOTE: Dragon Scale Mails are considered TREASURES

07/02/2001
- Ego Monsters, yes like Ego items but for monsters. New file re_info.txt
  defines all possible ego monsters types (skeletons, zombie, ...). It can
  modify, the flags, spells, level, speed, ac, ... of the monster that is
  turned into an ego monster.
  This will increase the randomness of the game, increase the number of
  monsters from 1031 to .. a lot... :)
  There are not much ego monsters right now, so feel free to submit them

09/02/2001
- Sorcerors can't use much armor
- Beastmasters have been give access to the Tribal realm, the Beastmaster's
  powers are now available through the 'U' key
- Player Raise death spells will now really create an undead. For example
  you cast raise death upon a kobold corpse and you can get a Skeleton Kobold,
  or a Zombie or a Spectre one. New Undead types will be added later. And I'm
  open to ideas naturally
- Narya activation is now Healing (500)
- Nenya activation is now Healing (800)

- Ents get nearly no sustenance from eating

15/02/2001
- Center player option
- Alchemist artifact creation now requires player level magic essences to
  work. The stats are permanently reduced upon failure (as it always meant to
  be). You PERMANENTLY lose 100 max hp when trying to create an artifact.
  This should reduce the number of mad alchemists :)
- Dark Swords as a new item type. They generate an antimagic field of 50%
  minus the sum of the enchantment (a +5+5 one will only do 40%) on a
  5 tile radius (also minus the enchantment)
- Unbelievers now generate a (player level)% antimagic field on a distance of
  (player level / 10)
- An antimagic field disables any form of magic on the user, and can prevent
  monsters from casting spells (not breathing). A 50% antimagic field will have
  a 50% chance of stopping a spell

18/02/2001
- Normal Artifacts. Normal Artifacts are artifacts found directly in k_info
  that doesn't require a place in a_info. That allow strange artifacts, like
  wands, rods, staff (those were possible already but ugly), ... and even
  food

23/02/2001
- Fixed a bug that allowed people in quests to use the '<' key to get to the
  wilderness timescale
- Fixed a quest bug that allowed players to regenerate the quest many times
- The Control the Three shadow spell is now much much more effective, since
  it removes black breath and DG_CURSE. The only little annoying thing is that
  it requires that player to wear the *THREE* rings. And that can only be
  accomplished with either the Possessor class (though they CAN'T cast the
  spell -- no hope for them) or The Scroll of Deincarnation

10/03/2001
- Monks can choose which spell to learn
- Fixed a bug with limited ESP description

- Symbiants can't hypnotize monsters that aren't pets anymore

15/04/2001
- Add an old patch from SC which allows dungeons to project an attack every
  few turns. For example a player in the Nether Realm will be hurt by nether
  every 3 turns for a damage of 10d10.
  The syntax is(up to 4 lines):
  E:<dice>d<sides>:<frequency>:<attack type>
- Volcano now does 2d10 damage each 10 turns, beware scrolls on the floor :)
- Lost Ruins of Numenor does 1d1 acid damage each turn (water will RUST you)

  For example you choose to be a human vampire, or a dwarf skeleton, ...
  Then some modifiers apply (stats, skills, extra powers, ...). Note that
  all races can't use all race modifiers
- New race modifier, Barbarian, the old barbarian race is gone
- New race, the Wood Elf from CathAngband, masters of the bow, with 1 extra

  and need to reach town
- Trap doors can't appear at the last level of dungeons or in non dungeons
- The concept of non-dungeon places: some "dungeons" got the FLAT flag
  meaning they are  ... flat, like a forest
- The concept of Towers, going up instead of down
- Updated birth.txt to take in account the race modifiers
- Wood Elves can go through trees
- Ammo similar to the one in your quiver will always be picked up

20/04/2001
- The death fate is way different now. When the player enters level he is
  fated to die on he gets teleported to a special level in a special dungeon.
  the level is empty, small and full of really out of depth monsters. Recall,
  genocide, ... are forbidden. There are no stairs, the only way to leave it is
  to kill every single monster of the level. Then the player is teleported
  back to town. Chance of surviving are *LOW* but not nonexistent :)
- The knowledge rune will now probe monsters
- Runecrafters are now playable (new damage formula) even at low levels !
  Now lets hope they are not TOO powerful :)
- Runecrafters upgraded. They can now:
        1) Cast a spell on the fly (as before)
2) Cast a runespell they memorized before (can memorize up to 100)
        3) Cast it from a carved runestone (uses 75% mana and does NOT need the
           runes to be present in the inventory, but consumes the runes during
           creation and it must be carried around to be used)
- Mormegil is now a Darksword and is quite nice
- Lesser & Greater Krakens now drop corpses

24/04/2001
- Add random towns in the dungeons. There can be up to 4 towns per dungeons.
  Not all dungeons (well should say places) can hold towns. Random town shops
  are took from the possible shops in st_info.txt with the RANDOM flag
- Stores in st_info.txt got flags
- When carving a Runestone the involved runes are destroyed
- Random towns can have different shapes, from vanilla one to hidden one
  (the stores are placed randomly on the level, without any buildings)
- When the player is invisible and does not have see invisible the @ symbol
  disappears
- Cannot locate undetected traps by simply 'l'ooking around
- Mariliths cannot use boots

26/04/2001

  Direct quote from Psiband change file:
  Rogues can set traps for monsters. This requires a "trapping kit" as a trigger
  and something to "load" the trap with.
  All scrolls, potions, wands, staffs and rods can be used (with the appropriate
  trigger) as traps to confuse, poison, teleport, genocide, ... unwary monsters.
  But standing next to a trap with area effects will hurt the player, too.
  There are also traps that shoot ammo: hidden catapults, bows and xbows.
  
  Some monsters can disarm traps, and a monster that has disarmed one of your
  traps will learn how to disarm all of them...
  
  Ammo Traps can have (+hit,+dam) just like bows. They can also be enchanted.
  All traps can have a [+AC] showing how hard it is to disarm it.

  it uses the evolving algorithm :)

  hint -> DG*)  --Mynstral
- Moved the rarity of the Phial of Undeath to the one of Galadriel
- Add Death Orb monster as suggested by Prfnoff a long time ago.
  They only move when in LOS. They multiply (quickly) and can hit to parasite

- Fixed a bug in cmovie that messed up the recording when the user specified
  different char than the normal ones
- Loadsave work is now pretty much complete. Barring the addition of
  transparent compression, which might happen later, there shouldn't be any

  lasts and such.
  Also each class have a specific max on the number of levels they can achieve
  in each spells. This should help the high mage class since they get twice the
  max level of mages. Also illusionists gets more than mages.
  Also note that sometimes one more level wont change anything while 2 or 3
  more WILL change. And lastly some spells are not affected by levels at all
  One last thing, sorcerors cannot learn spells and thus cannot increase their
  spell level which will always be 1

29/08/2001
- Totaly rewrote the random artifact system. It now use an external ra_info
  file to define what power the artifact will get. The format is very similar
  to e_info(expect it doesnt include the 5 flags sets). Each entry define for
  which tval/sval it can be applied. Then when the game wants to create a
  randart it simply defines a number of powers to grab and randomly pick up
  the powers from ra_info(following the restriction, rarity and levels).
  This allow a totaly change of the randarts if needed, an easy addition of
  new powers, ...

  Coire), 3 middle days(Enderi) and one starting(Yestare) and one ending
  (Mettare) day.

- Added "breaking" abilities for stun, slow and confusion
- Dumped the Pern monster list, will return dearly beloved nasties

  separate monster lists for each dungeon

  too common.

  full list, get a copy of Pern.

  some other monsters.
- Returned the Yeeks and Shrieker mushroom patches.  (Yes, let your joy
  explode!)
- Began adding Mycoparasitologist class
  They will be able to determine what kind of parasite hatches from 
  parasite eggs.  They know how to put parasite eggs into empty bottles,
  which prevents them from being infested by their own eggs.  They also
  will be able to summon specific molds or mushroom patches.  They have
  full knowledge of all mushrooms and will be able to summon mushrooms
  (the items) of certain kinds if they exist on a level.  They'll 
  probably be able to do other things, but I can't think of them now.

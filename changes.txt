* Quests should no longer repeat, at least it should be really unlikely now, this time for sure.
* Some effects of doomspells will no longer be activated with wands of spark!
* Wielding a 2-hander while wielding two weapons no longer deletes the weapon on the arm.
* Items which cure stunning no longer automatically identified (a fix in set_stun)
* Throwing now displays the ability to take the Oath of Iron properly
* Plasma Hounds gain IM_FIRE, as they're plasma breathers
* Turns now displayed in character screen
* Stores should now order items properly
* Fixed error in Oath of Iron martial art damage
* Dragon breathing now lets you know if you don't have any essences
* Stair creation will only create down staircases for ironman characters
* 'C'haracter screen changed slightly, now correctly displays cancelled flags, and emphasizes immunities.  Temporary resists are also included.
* Burgling an item should now report the correct quantity of items recieved.  This may do funny things to items that change names when they are in your inventory.

PseudoGraphics
==============

Don't bother reading this if your aren't using the Win32 version.

The Windows version has always allowed you to use simple graphics for
walls and magma/quartz streams. Version 1.8b removed default support
for this so that you can use any font installed on your computer.

If you are using one of the lib\xtra\font files, and not a font installed
on your computer, you can restore the pseudo-graphics by renaming the
lib\user\font-win-pseudo.prf file to font-win.prf.

- Implement all varient changes as options, so I can prove that the majority
  of my implementation work is actually better than core vanilla code, in
  terms of size/algorithm complexity.
- Tidy up order of GF_ types so that we could consider making resistances
  for items/monsters using ordered flags.
- Allow monsters to attack other monsters while confused.
- Allow monsters to breath while confused and end up attacking in wrong
  direction.
- Give features a saving throw in project_f equal to the feature power * 20,
  or 20 if power=0. If a number 1d(save) is rolled higher than the attack
  damage, then the feature resists destruction.
- Make features react to the presence of monsters with the appropriate flags
- Make monsters attack features that they can damage with blows if they are
  blocked by the feature
- Make fleeing monsters push past other monsters/get pushed past by other
  monsters
- Make thieves flee once they steal stuff, and drop stuff if out of sight
- Balance the number of monsters so that we don't get too many monsters deep
  in the dungeon (Easily happen with summoning out of sight and FRIEND flag)
- Add HAS_AURA flag and AURA attack that continously radiates a radius 1
  blow type from a monster
- Adopt smart features from other varients (Don't we all)

To do list of changes from an old lost version of Angband that I coded back in 1994/95:
- Allow monsters to cast spells while out of sight. Not actually that big a
  change, however play balance may be required, as this makes many spell
  casters much more powerful and dangerous. We centre summons on the
  summoning monster and warn the player by telling them they hear chanting
  in the distance of various forms, prevent spells that require line of
  sight, allow spells that require project when a monster is out of line of
  sight, and balls to shoot against regions near a player, if the player is
  in the area of effect. This may cause somewhat of a performance hit. Some
  spells (eg heal) really ought to be allowed while out of sight, with
  minimal modification
- Make teleporters teleport only if out of sight and high hit points, or in
  sight only while low hit points, along with phase door if adjacent and have
  better spell attacks. This should keep blink dogs and phase spiders more
  'together'
- Implement FRIEND flag to allow monster to have friends if found deeper in
  the dungeon and add flag to all sorts of monsters
- Remove duplicate monsters that are not needed once FRIEND flag is added
- Make elementals 10 faster, and have more spells
- Make dragons get more spells, and earlier (Should make them more of a
  threat).
- Add all sorts of cool monsters (I still have this list) including trees
  that (get this) make sense
- Remove BR_NETH from Dracolisk as this is in error. (The original AD&D
  monster never had this ability, I believe it was added when someone
  misread Dracolisk for Dracolich). Monsters to appear in groups only if
  deeper as flag rather than dual entries.

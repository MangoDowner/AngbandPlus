=== PosBand display modules ===

Angband and its variants are very portable games. They run on the wide
variety of systems.  The only platform-dependent part is "display
module" -- Angband front-end.

Windows or Macintosh users may skip this file. They will have a nice GUI
display module for their system. Unix/Linux users should read this.

Display module can be selected with option "-mxxx", where "xxx" is display
module name. If you plan to implement a new display module, look into
file src/main-xxx.c.

Some modules accept sub-options, which need to be prefixed with "--"
("posband -mgcu -- -b").

--> "gcu" (curses)  Configuration option: --with-curses (on by default)

Classical console front-end. It can either run with four windows -- main
window 3/4 of the screen, the rest assigned to others -- or with one big
window.  Pseudo-graphics will be used if available.  Suboptions are:

-o
	Use old, dimmer color scheme
	
-b
	Use big-screen mode


--> "lfb" (Linux framebuffer)  Configuration option: --with-lfb

A front-end for Linux framebuffer console (that thing that displays
a penguin during the bootup).  Supports fonts and tile graphics.  Works
on all 8/16/24/32-bit framebuffers.

!!! Note that this front-end works with framebuffer device (/dev/fb0).
    You need read-write access to this device to use this front-end.

Suboptions are:

-d<device>
	Use the selected framebuffer device.  Default is "/dev/fb0".

-f<font>
	Use the selected font.  Default is "10x20".  Fonts are stored
	in lib/xtra/font directory as monochrome BMP files.  Specify
	the font name without path or ".bmp" extension.

-o
	Use the old graphical tiles (8x8), if available.

-a
	Use Adam Bolt's graphical tiles (16x16), if available.

-g
	Use David Gervais' graphical tiles (32x32), if available.

-b
	Use bigtile mode (tile is twice wider than the character).
	Recommended.

-c<wid>x<hgt>
	Override the tile size.  Useful if you play with tiles and want
	to disable scaling.  Default is same as character size, 10x20
	with default font.  Try "-c16x32 -f12x24 -g -b" for good display
	with David Gervais tiles; however, this will require at least
	1280x768 display resolution. "-c8x16 -f8x13 -g -a" will work
	with Adam Bolt tiles.

Font and tile options can be changed in the runtime, through user
menu ("!").

This is a new front-end, and relatively little tested.  If you have
any problems, please report the information about video mode from "!"
menu (of course, if you can see it).


--> "vcs" (Virtual console)  Configuration option: --with-vcs

Linux virtual console front-end, uses VCs directly.  Faster than "gcu",
and allows redefining colors.  No suboptions; uses a single big window.

!!! Note that this front-end works with virtual console device (/dev/vcsa*).
    You need read-write access to this device to use this front-end.


--> "xaw" (X Athena)  Configuration option: --with-xaw (on by default)

GUI X Window front-end, uses X Athena widget set.  Suboptions are:

-d<display>
	Use the specified X display.

-n<number>
	Use the specified number of windows, default is 1.

-o
	Use the old graphical tiles (8x8), if available.

-a
	Use Adam Bolt's graphical tiles (16x16), if available.

-g
	Use David Gervais' graphical tiles (32x32), if available.

-b
	Use bigtile mode (tile is twice wider than the character).
	Recommended.

-s
	Turn _off_ smooth tile rescaling.

Permanent configuration is possible with X resources.  See comments at
"src/main-xaw.c", or, if you didn't understand a word :),
"http://posband.earthsea.org/unix-faq/index.html#x11-customize".

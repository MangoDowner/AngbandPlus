Changes from 0.2.3 to 0.3.0: 

(Entries marked by '*' have changed since the 0.3.0 beta)

## Gamplay Changes ##

- 0.2.3 or older savefiles are not compatible. Also, 0.3.0 savefiles are not guarunteed
  to be compatible with future versions.

# Races/Classes #

- New class: Spellsword. They are a "pure" mage/warrior hybrid; unlike rangers they can
  use all mage books, but on the other hand have none of the ranger's special abilities,
  and they start gaining spells later (level 5). They are similar in combat skills to 
  paladins.

- Hobbits now get intrinsic hold life instead of sustained dexterity.

- Mages and rangers now gain a disease resistance spell in a dungeon book.

* Some tweaking of early bard spells making them a little easier to start. Also, the bard
  spell "Aggravation tempo" now asks for confirmation before casting (because you don't 
  want to activate it by mistake). 

* Several later mage attack spells strengthened. However, magic missile will no longer beam.

- Bard and mage invisibility spells now cost more mana.

# Stat/abilities #

- The effects of stats on spell and mana acquiration is now more gradual - no huge jumps
  at certain stats. (Taken from Zangband but altered to more closely match the old values).

- Gloves and heavy armor no longer provide mana penalties but instead provide penalties to
  fail rates - gloves provide a major penalty and heavy armor depends on how heavy it is.

- Disease weakened - The power level for disease attacks reduced somewhat; disease slowed
  down a bit; sustain now provides limited protection against disease drain. 

# Combat #

- You can now get extra blows when fighting unarmed (equivalent to a weightless weapon). 

- Heroism and Berserk rage effects improved. Heroism now gives +15 to hit. Berserk rage
  gives +15 to hit, +15 damage, 1 extra blow, -25 to ac, disrupts spellcasting, and 
  reduces your saving throws, magic devices, and stealth skills.

- Stealth effect on Invisiblity/Monster blindness rewritten. Also, invisibility is now 
  adversly affected by your light radius - the brighter a light you make, the more likely
  the monster is to spot you (realism would probably dictate having the player walk around
  lightless in order to be invisible, but that would be unplayable).

* Significantly increased the list of monsters that can't be cut to include all those that
  made no sense - most molds and mushrooms, elementals, vortices, most undead, most golems,
  creeping coins, and others. To compensate, bleeding has been made more powerful.

# Interface #

- Added new unified use command option (use_command), taken from Zangband. If turned on,
  the 'u' key ('Z' for roguelike commands) will work not only for staves but also for 
  actiavations, food, potions, scrolls, wands, rods and talismans. Unlike in Zangband, it
  will not fire arrows. The unified use command is in the user interface options page 
  and is turned off by default.

# Items #

Note - several of the changes below were inspired by Johnathan Ellis's edit patches, 
though often further tweaks were made.

* New items: 3 new rods (satisfy hunger, summoning, darkness), 2 new talismans (force bolts,
  stone-to-mud), 4 new amulets (sustenance, resist water,  resistance, infravision), 3 new
  lanterns (shadows, infravision, telepathy).

- A few items have been changed -
    - Amulet of the Magi made considerably more powerful (as in recent JLE patch).
    - Wand of wonder can now imitate any wand, including the most powerful ones.
    - Staff of holiness now cures disease.
    - Potions of Infravision now provide radius +3 to infravision rather than +1. Their
      duration, however, has been halved.

- A few items have been removed: 
  - 5 wands - disarming, acid balls, lightning balls, fire balls, and cold balls. These 
    abilities are now exclusive to talismans.
  - 2 rods - sleep monster, slow monster - already on wands and staves, no need for three way
    to get them.
  - Dwarven Shovel - too many similar diggers with no real use
  - Ring of weakness, ring of Stupidity, ring of Slowness - these were totally pointless, as
    identifying one meant that the rest were junk, and were redundant with negative pval rings. 
	The ration for negative pvals on rings/amulets was raised, so the amount of bad rings of 
	strength shouldn't drop by far from the old total of rings of strength + weakness.

- The artifact list has been considerably modified, with an aim of giving more options in
  the latter game, while removing some of the earlier artifacts to make ego items more
  attractive. In order to achieve this, many artifacts have changed, some of them changing
  base types, others gaining new abilities or losing them. Many also change depths and 
  rarities. 9 new artifacts were introduces (7 out of the JLE patch, some of which come
  from other variants originally), and 8 artifacts were removed. 

- Ego items have also been altered, the "slay" weapons (not ammo) gain the abilities of the 
  appropriate *slay* weapons, which have been removed (excpet *slay* dragon which was made
  more powerful). Several other ego-weapons improved as well, while cloaks of kings have 
  been weakened. 3 new ego types were added - Polearms of hacking, blunt weapons of crushing,
  and gloves of combat (the old gloves of combat are now gloves of power, as per JLE patch). 
  Also, ego items that grant one random ability no longer have an equal chance of each ability, 
  instead a new system takes depth and relative usefulness into account (so harder to find a
  blessed weapon that gives ESP or Invisiblity early on, while later there won't be many that
  give slow digestion).

- Several of the less powerful item abilities made more useful:
  - Wielding blessed weapons now also improves chances of critical hits.
  - Feather fall now prevents gravity attacks from moving you.
  - The HEALTH and MANA flags will now provide larger bonuses to hp and mana if your stats
    are high enough (it provides 10 points per pval OR 5% of the relevant stat per pval, 
    whichever is more).

- News handling for wands, staves, and rods -
  - Rods split into rods and talismans (`). Talismans are directional, rods are not. 
    Talismans are invoked by the new 'y' command ('S' in the roguelike keyset). They 
    are also lighter than rods.
  - A cap has been added on rod/talisman stacking - you can only have 3 rods or 
    5 talismans in a single stack.
  - Attack wands and talismans now allow partial failure - which decreases damage. Wands
    have a lower chance of failure in general than talismans. This should make talismans
    and wands somewhat more useful to characters with low-mediocre magic devices skill. 
    Rod and staff failure rates not changed.
  - The damage done by most offensive talismans and wands changed - it is now character 
    level dependant, and will generally be better than before. Wands unaffected are the 
    wand of magic missile, the wand of stinking cloud and the wand of light; neither 
    is the talisman of light. 
  - If the player is stunned, it reduces his chances of success using magic items.

- Changed the calculation of what is a "good" item to be more dependant on player depth - 
  early on many items are considered good that later on will not be.

# Monsters #

- Water hounds are now light blue to prevent confusion with the neighbouring acid hounds.
  Mana hounds are now violet rather than multi-colour, to prevent confusion with chaos and
  aether hounds.

- "The Great Sentient Treasure" has been renamed "The Hoard".

* The "rust monster" has been renamed "corroding monster" as its attacks are really acid
  attacks.

- Giants Mantises are now more powerful.

- Bats gain SEE_INVIS and NO_BLIND (since they use sonar rather than sight). 

# Other Changes #

* Changed the way quest failure is calculated - now, once you visit the quest level, you
  have a chance of failing it whenever you spend time off-level, even in the town or in 
  above it. However, you can't fail it before visiting the quest level at least once.

* Nests and Pits now provide different rating bonuses depending on their type and depth - 
  an orc pit down below 1500' will not increase rating, but a demon pit will increase 
  rating up to 5000'. OOD monsters within them still count, of course. Also, time spent in 
  the town no longer counts against the level feeling counter (in other words, if you spend
  the required 1000 turns on a level and recall out, you'll get a feeling no matter how 
  long you were in town. If you didn't spend enough time in the dungeon and entered town,
  you won't get a feeling no matter how long you spend there).

* Several new nest and pit types: gold and bronze dragon pits, horror nests, and 
  people pits.

- Spikes have been completely removed from the game. The 'j'am command has been cancelled.

* Added a compile-time option which controls whether haggling exists in the game. It 
  defaults to off, so haggling is no longer officially present in Ey (it will return if 
  and when I can do it right). This results in the (obvious) removal of the "auto_haggle"
  option. The 10% "sales-tax" no longer exists as such, but the charisma table has been 
  adjusted so most characters will have prices very similar to those they used to get with
  auto_haggle on.

- Artifact knowledge is replaced by a browser, similar to the object/monster browsers. 

* Added artifact "memory" - now, if you *identify* an artifact, you don't have to 
  *identify* it again in future games to know its abilities, just identify it. Note that
  this is ignored in the case of randarts, obviously.

- Change in the way alchemy knowledge is gained - when drinking potions, you can now only
  gain info about its components if the component's flavor is already known to you. As 
  compensation, the chances of getting knowledge are now higher. Note that *ID* can still
  give you unknown components. Also, changed the way the alchemy table is determined to
  be more balanced.

- The "cheat_extra" option removed, having been incorporated into cheat_wizard.

- If a character dies in wizard mode (cheat_wizard), upon loading the savefile you will get
  the tombstone instead of a new character (allowing you to examine its equipment again). 
  Pressing 'w' on the death menu disables wizard mode allowing you to create a new
  character on the same savefile.

- Turning on wizard mode via the command-line argument now turns on all cheat options
  (except cheat_no_save), to make debugging easier.

- Cheat wizard now shows the monster index when looking at monster memory; also, the 
  object and monster browsers show the appropriate indexes.

- It is now possible to turn on wizard and fiddle mode on using the .ini file in windows.

- Improved ring wielding code; now know more cases in which not to ask.

- To prevent over-long names, the mystics books have been renamed "books of mystic lore"
  instead of "books of mystic teachings".

## Non-Gameplay Affecting Changes ##

- Impletemented a two-tier monster system. Uniques now get their abilities from a new
  u_info.txt file, and have a base monster "race". Currently, this is only partially 
  implemented (uniques can not be based on regular monsters, only on special placeholders),
  and several aspects of this change have not been implemented (relating to monster memory
  and graphics). There should currently be no gameplay differences from the old system.

- The tvals for soft armor and hard armor combined (now both are 36). Svals for hard armors
  changed to match. The tvals for helms and crowns combined (now 32). Svals for crowns
  changed to match.

- Cleaned up some code.

- Corrected and updated some help files.

## Bug fixes ##

* Fixed bug which prevented the creation of OOD ego-items.

* Fixed bug which made temporary resist water/disease permanent.

* Fixed bug preventing artifacts being generated as quest rewards.

- Fixed bug which allowed paladins/rangers to achieve 0% spell failure.

- Fixed bug which prevented the creation of randart wizard robes.

- Fixed selling of un-identified lanterns.

* Lavender potions are now purple, not light green.

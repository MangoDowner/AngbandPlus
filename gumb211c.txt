============================================================================
= Gumband 2.1.1c: Changes from ZAngband 2.1.1c = Last Update: 24-Nov-2000  =
============================================================================
I have never compiled this for any platform other than MS-DOS, so your
milage may vary.  I won't be compiling anything but DOS versions, either,
but anyone who wants to compile and upload for their favorite platform is
free to do so, of course.  I can't make heads or tails out of most of the
standard makefiles, so you'll have to do some hacking of 'em on your own if
you plan to compile...
============================================================================
On that subject, I've compiled without graphics or sound, using main-ibm.c.
If you want the graphics, recompile using main-dos.c, I suppose...
============================================================================
Send any and all suggestions or complaints to gumby@gwar.net - but remember
that my C skills are minimal, so the changes to the source will be as well.
============================================================================
There have been other minor changes than those listed here that aren't worth
individual mentions.
============================================================================
Please note that the numbering is just for convenience and not any sort of
chronology of the changes I've made since the list has been rewritten and
reordered several times now. :)
============================================================================

01) Enabled the Monk hack to make their speed bonus cumulative with those
    of Klackons and Sprites. [config.h] I've played them both with and
    without the 'hack' enabled and have never really seen the point of
    adding the code to limit them in the first place - after all, Sprites
    and Klackons don't have the 'legal' option to be Monks, so why was
    special effort made to balance them? Plus speed's soooo common in ZAng
    that a little more won't hurt. :)

02) Tweaked the pseudo-ID of most classes. The various spellcasting Warriors
    have all been speeded up a bit (to the 60000 mark), with Warrior-Magi
    gaining heavy sensing. Magi have been changed to the (plev * plev + 40)
    formula. High Magi now use the same formula as Mindcrafters - still
    rather slow, but they needed it to be playable, IMHO. :) The rest have
    had their pseudo-ID's speeded only slightly. [dungeon.c]

03) Rings and Amulets can now be pseudo-ID'd, tho only as good, average and
    cursed. [dungeon.c]

04) Got rid of the autoroller delay during character creation. [birth.c]
    Yes, it keeps players a bit more honest with their stats to keep the
    autoroller relatively slow, but that does nothing useful except fill the
    high-scores table with tons of low-level characters and force players to
    hang around the 'stat-gain' levels until they're bored to tears. And
    once past stat-gain, does it really matter what your starting statistics
    were?

05) Many activated artifacts, wands, staves, rods, etc., now deal 50% more
    damage. [cmd6.c, object1.c] IMHO, they're usually so weak that there's
    no incentive to use the offensive abilities of these objects, except for
    the occasional blast with a ball-spell item against *WEAK* breeders or
    group monsters.

06) Spell damages have been adjusted upwards a bit, up to 50% or so more
    effective. Cure Light, Medium and Critical Wounds have had their die
    rolls increased by 50% as well. [cmd5.c, object2.c] Spellcasters are
    supposed to attack with magic, but the normal damage rolls were rather
    pathetic, causing spellcasters to melee as much, if not more, as they
    cast damage spells...

07) The Mindcrafter power 'Precognition' now detects doors and stairs at
    character level 5, with detect traps moved to character level 10.
    [cmd5.c]

08) The Identify portion of 'Psychometry' has been moved up to level 30,
    inserting an *Identify* effect at level 45. [cmd5.c] No justification
    for this other than that I wanted to. :)

09) Again with the Mindcrafters, the Dimension Door part of 'Minor
    Displacement' has been moved to level 30. [cmd5.c]

10) Replaced the Trump Spell "Reset Recall" with the spell "Minor
    Divination," which detects traps, doors, stairs and normal monsters.
    [cmd5c., tables.c] Reset Recall is almost completely useless since you
    couldn't Reset to a depth that you had never visited. The cost and fail
    rate for Minor Divination are the same as they were for Reset Recall, so
    there's no cheap & easy early detection for Trump users. :)

11) Removed spellbooks from the Temple and Magic Shoppe - they were too much
    competition for the Bookstore. :) [store.c, init2.c]

12) Removed the aggravation/XP-drain option and the NO_TELE flag from
    Stormbringer. It now deals 8d8 damage (to jibe with The Stormbringer's
    attacks as a monster) and is permanently cursed instead. [xtra2.c] I'm a
    complete bastard, ain't I? :)

13) Potions of New Life are cheaper and more common. Instead of re-rating
    your hit points and then removing all mutations, it first removes all of
    your mutations and then polymorphs you, for the same effect as the
    Polymorph Self spell. [cmd6.c] Now you might end up again with the
    mutation you were desperate to get rid of in the first place, or turn
    into a Yeek or an Abomination. :)

14) Altered the purses of the store owners, mainly to remove the 5000 gold
    limits on the Armour and Weapon Shops. The upper limits for a couple of
    shops has been increased a bit, and the rest have a more even flow to
    the different purses. [tables.c]

15) Only Warrior-Magi have access to the Arcane Realm.

##) Made the following major changes to classes and races:
    [birth.c  - magic, starting equipment
     xtra1.c  - melee and missile attacks, intrinsics display(?)
     tables.c - magic costs and race/class definitions
     files.c  - intrinsics definitions(?)]

Golems: XP required now at +150% (up from +100%).
        They now have 13 hit dice (up from 12 HD).
        Magic Devices skill now at +5 (up from -5). [being magical devices
           themselves, Golems have an instinctive understanding of these
           things]
        They no longer get intrinsic See Invisible, Free Action or their
           level 35 Hold Life.

Ranger: Bonus melee attack at level 25.
        Bonus shots with Short and Long Bows at levels 15, 30 and 45,

        +1 to hit and to damage every 10 levels.
        Nature magic only, no secondary realm.
        Begins with Short Bow instead of second spellbook.

                 Warriors.

              +1 to hit and to damage every 5 levels.
              Arcane magic only, no secondary realm.
              Begins with Hard Leather Armour instead of second spellbook.

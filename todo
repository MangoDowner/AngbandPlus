Pseudo-id is too faaaaast...

Make hiscore list show class information
(maybe) Add realms

Reject non-Multiband savefiles, do conversions for older Multiband savefiles
Then I can change VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH and headers in *_info.txt's

---

Add auto-more option
Show permanent walls in different colour - cyan or umber?

Add code for set_shadow, wizard_lock, set_invis, SUMMON_SHADOWS, and
then fix spell_flags so those spells can be seen in books again

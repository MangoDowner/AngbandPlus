=== Message from the Maintainer ===Hello everyone!If you are playing it, you are required to send me bug reports, mispellings, any anything that happens that seems like it shouldn't.The easiest way to insure that you remember everything is to playthe game with notepad open.The most important thing to be looking for at this stage is balance.Always finding an artifact where it's never powerful enough to use it?Got a resist maxed and nothing attacks you with it? Consistantly gettingkilled by the same unique? Certain powers too weak or never used? Please,if you're playing with something besides an automaton or steam-mechawrite in with your thoughts on balance.There are many nifty new features in this variant, including NPP stylequests, steamware,  a libray that you can return books to for skill points,new pits, skills, detailed FAQ's, skill point maximum raising in the home,all new monsters, and other assorted niftyness. Please try different race class combinations - spellbooks are very cool also, I highly suggestchecking out the new priest sanctuary spell. Otherwise let me know about bugs,and balance!Have at it!You can also join the steamband mailing list! You do this by sending ane-mail to Steamband-subscribe@yahoogroups.com . This will keep you up to date on all the latest steamband developments.-Campbell (VALIS)valis@oook.cz

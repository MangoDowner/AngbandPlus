Based on V 2.9.3 the work on "Dungeon City" starts...


Slim down / Simplification (deEMACSification)
=============================================

- Started removing options. Their effects are now either permanently
  ON or OFF. Code for the options that are now permanently OFF has been
  removed:
  auto_scum (OFF), depth_in_feet (OFF), birth_maximize (ON), 
  show_labels (ON), show_weights (ON), show_choices (ON), show_details (ON)
  no_stores (OFF), preserve mode (ON), ironman (OFF),
  no_artifacts (OFF), expand_look (ON), expand_list (ON),
  dungeon_align (ON), dungeon_stair (ON), rand_arts (OFF),
  compress_savefile (ON), run_ignore_stairs (ON), run_ignore_doors (ON),
  run_cut_corners (ON), disturb_move (ON), disturb_near (ON), disturb_state (ON),
  disturb_minor (ON), disturb_other (ON), verify_destroy (ON), verify_special (ON),
  alert_hitpoint (OFF), alert_failure (OFF), allow_quanity (ON),
  auto_more (OFF), ring_bell (OFF),

- Simplified "economy": 
  Removed Shop owners and everything related to them including
  haggling. You always pay the full price and sell at the half
  price.

- Removed support for old savefiles

- Removed borg support

- Removed class tiles

- Removed player history

- Removed player social class

- Removed stat roller/auto-roller. Point-based character 
  generation is the standard now.


D&Dification / deTOLKIENification
==================================

If I use the term "D&D" I mean the 3.5th edition.

- Started reworking the item list
  * Weapon list should conform to D&D now. 
    Well name, weight, dice and cost should.
    Weapons still work like in vanilla.
    Changing to a more D&Dish system is planned in future.
  * Armor list should conform to D&D now.
    Ok only name, weight, cost. 
    Changing armor mechanics to be more D&Dish
    is planned.

- Renamed some classes:
  Priest -> Cleric, Mage -> Wizard, Warrior -> Fighter
  Actually making the V classes work more like the D&D
  ones is planned.

- Reworked player races. You have the basic
  D&D player races now with correct stat mods
  but the rest is still vanilla. Making the races
  work more like in D&D is planned.
  I like a large race selection so I will add
  D&D races who aren't standard player races.
  First victim: Goblin. 
  LATER ADDITION: I also added the Drow race.
  
- Got rid of the stupid 18/XXX stats. Stat progression
  is now linear 18, 19, 20, etc. like in current D&D

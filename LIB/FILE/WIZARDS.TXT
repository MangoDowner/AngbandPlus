# File: wizards.txt

# This file contains a list of userid's allowed to become wizards
# This file is not used on MACINTOSH, where anyone can be a wizard.

# Lines starting with "#" are comments, a line containing "*" means
# anyone can be a wizard, and a line containing a user-id means that
# that user-id can be a wizard.  Note that some single user machines
# use a user-id of "zero" for everyone (not just "root").

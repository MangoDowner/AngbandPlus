# This is the file for allowing uniques to speak their "own" lines.
# Deleting this file will have no real effect on the game.  Modifying it may
# cause STRANGE unique lines to come up if the format's wrong, but shouldn't
# crash anything.  The format goes like so:
# 
# N:45:whoever this is
# 3
# says bravado line 1
# says bravado line 2
# says bravado line 3
# 2
# says fear line 1
# says fear line 2
#
# The number after the N: is the "monster index number" obtained from
# r_info.txt.  The text field after that number isn't actually used--it's
# just there to help humans edit the file.  The numbers on lines by
# themselves say the number of "bravado" and "fear" lines.  Getting these
# numbers wrong won't crash anything, but will produce strange lines.
# If you want monsters to get their "bravado" lines from "bravado.txt"
# instead, then format it like N:45 below:
#
# N:45:foo                       N:46:bar
# 0                              3
# 3                              bravado lines 1-3
# fear lines 1-3                 0
#
# N:46 applies if you want the monsters to get their fear lines from 
# "monfear.txt" and their bravado lines from this file.  
#
# Two or more monsters can share lines; just put their N: lines in a
# contiguous block.
#
# To stop a certain monster from having unique lines, put a # in front of
# its N: line.
#
# Have fun with this!     --Matt G

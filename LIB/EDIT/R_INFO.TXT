# File: r_info.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
# After modifying this file, delete the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file.

# Currently, "unique" monsters are just "special" monster races, with
# the requirement that only one monster of that race can exist at a time,
# and when it is killed, it can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters acquire their attr from the item/floor below them,
# and use "white" for the recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters have a "flickering" attr, and use "violet" for the
# recall window.  See "cave.c" for info.

# ATTR_METAL monsters have a occasionally "flickering" attr which is one
# step lighter than their base color.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters use special symbols (.) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.  In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# floors, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# CHAR_MULTI monsters use special symbols (!, ?, =) as given below,
# and use those symbols for the recall window.  In theory, normally,
# these monsters cannot be targetted, and when examined look like normal
# objects, until the player "notices" them (perhaps check "awake").

# Note that there are (a few) normal monsters who are "violet" but not
# ATTR_MULTI, and a lot of monsters which are "white" but not ATTR_CLEAR.

# Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see.

# Note that the monster list underwent several changes for Angband 2.7.9,
# including some monster name changes, some symbol redistributions, and
# some color changes.

# The Umber Hulk joined the Xorn/Xaren (X).  The ticks (t) joined the
# spiders (S).  The townspeople (t) left the people (p).  The major demons 
# (&) became (U) and the minor demons (I) became (u).  Multiplying insects 
# (fleas, fruit flies, hummerhorns) became (I), visually "matching" the 
# multiplying lice (l). The "ant lions" (a) became "ants" (a).  The mummified 
# monsters (M) joined the zombified monsters (z).  The multi-headed hydras 
# (M) left the reptiles (R).  The snakes (J) left the reptiles (R).

#   The "dragons", "hounds" and "vortex" monsters underwent a "color 
# scheme regularization": 'w' = White/Cold, 's' = Black/Acid, 'o' = Lite, 
# 'r' = Red/Fire, 'g' = Green/Poison, 'b' = Blue/Elec, 'u' = Brown/Earth/Force, 
# 'D' = Dark/etc, 'W' = Stone/Inertia/Gravity/etc, ATTR_MULTI = Multi-hued,
# Chaos or Disenchantment/etc, 'y' = Gold/Sound, 'v' = Nexus (hounds and 
# vortices) or Balance (dragons), 'G' = Nether, 'B' = Time (hounds, vortices) 
# or Law (dragons, breathe sound/shards), 'U' = Bronze/Confusion, 'R' = Plasma.

#   In several situations, two or more monsters with identical symbols and
# colors were changed so that maximal information is conveyed by the symbol
# and color.

#   "v"iolet is often used by the biggest, toughest unique (or sometimes non-
# unique) monster in a race. Mughash, Azog, The Mouth of Sauron, Gothmog and 
# many others are treated like this. Monsters where a specific other color is 
# implied are exempt from this - e.g. Ancalagon the Black, Morgoth Lord of
# Darkness, the fact that the Ringwraiths were alternatively called the "Black 
# Riders", Gabriel being an angel of light, The Phoenix being such a fiery 
# creature that it has to be red, Fundin Bluecloak being blue, etc.

# The "people" (p), with more than 50 entries, got a new "color scheme"
# ('w' = Paladin, 's' = Knight, 'o' = Mystic, 'r' = Mage, 'g' = Priest, 
# 'b' = Thief, 'u' = Warrior, 'D' = Death knight, 'W' = Ranger, 'v' = Big Bad 
# Unique (this also applies to most monster races now), 'R' = Unique Mage, 
# 'G' = Unique Priest, 'B' = Unique Thief, 'U' = Unique Warrior).  Note that 
# most non-unique "people" already had these colors, or colors close to these 
# colors.  A similar color scheme was enforced for the "humanoid" (h) monsters 
# as well, more or less. However, if a color is implied directly by a monster's 
# name, then that takes precedence over the color scheme: as in the case of 
# "Fundin Bluecloak" or "Ancalagon the Black".

# Many of the "unique" monsters were changed to "match" the "base" monster
# from which they were derived. 

# Mushrooms look just like food (and use the "," symbol for both the recall
# window and for normal display), Creeping coins look just like coins (and
# use the "$" symbol for both the recall window and for normal display), and
# Trappers/Lurkers can never be seen (and use the "." symbol for the recall
# window).  There are also mimics of scrolls, potions, chests and rings, each
# of which uses the appropriate symbol for the recall window and for normal 
# display. All other monsters use "alphabetic" symbols, and "alphabetic"
# symbols are used only for monsters.

# The "0" and "9" symbols are reserved for internal debugging use.

# The "&" symbol is reserved for future use as a special "terrain feature".

# The "`" symbol is reserved as an "alternate" open door picture, since
# the "'" symbol looks like the "," symbol in some fonts (esp. IBM).

# The "x" symbol is free for use as an "attr/char mapping" for annoying
# monsters, such as magic mushrooms, drolems, etc.

# Certain symbols ("X", "Y", "B", "l", "I", etc) are used by
# very few monsters, and could be reorganized somewhat.

# There are still too many "p" monsters, perhaps they should be broken up.

# As always, you can enforce any "visual picture" you want with a "pref file".

# Note that monster zero contains the "player" picture.

#   A lot of new monsters have been added in this patch - 46, to be exact, while 5 
# old ones have gone missing. The S_HI_DEMON spell is actually going to be scary 
# now, as opposed to wimpy... there are also new "B"irds, "q"uadrupeds, some dragon 
# gaps are now filled, the "character-class-type" "p"eople have been filled out so 
# that all classes have their "novice", "experienced" and "expert" levels. Some old
# friends have come back from Moria, two titanic Giant uniques have joined the fun,
# and there are various others, some Tolkienish, some less so.

### Gone AWOL (5)

# - Cerberus (duplication of role with Carcharoth - Hound Guarding Hell, Personal 
# Servant Of The Master Of The Underworld)
# - Tiamat (duplication of role with Ancalagon - Biggest Baddest Dragon Of All)
# - Archpriest (duplication of role with Patriarch - two "expert" priests, too close
# to each other in level)
# - Novice Archer (duplication of role with Novice Ranger - two "novice" archer-types.)
# - Emperor Quylthulg (near-duplication of Qlzqqlzzuup, who now has this title.)

#   Giants are much tougher (and deeper.) Two uniques have been added to the race 
# (see above).

#   Dracolisks, -liches and titans are placed deeper, on the grounds that they are 
# tougher than uniques at their original level and for some levels deeper even than
# that... compare the Balrog of Moria, or Smaug, for instance.

#   Big rationalisation of the Dragons: now there is a "baby", "young", "mature",
# "ancient" and "wyrm" form for all of red, white, blue, green, black, gold, bronze
# and multi-hued. Other dragons come usually in two types - the "drake" and a 
# greater form, sometimes called a "dragon" (as in Ethereal Dragon - the former 
# Death Drake and Great Crystal Drake are now Shadow and Crystal Dragons), or a 
# Great Wyrm (as in drakes and great wyrms of Law, Chaos and Balance.)

#   Changes to monster depths in the late stages: to make sure that at least *one*
# new monster has a native depth at every depth from 2500' to 4000', and no more 
# than one unique per level. No new non-uniques appear after 4000'. 

#   I understand that dracolisks used to breathe nexus, not nether, and that this 
# was changed, possibly to constant confusion with dracoliches. I prefer the 
# original version, and have changed them back. (They still breathe fire for a 
# big amount of damage, and who is going to bother resisting nexus at this level? 
# At which point, you suddenly find yourself sinking through the floor of that 
# level with the Greater Vault on it...) It makes sense: they're not undead, and 
# only hounds and vortices among non-undead things ought to breathe nether in my 
# opinion... and that thanks to the fact that they enjoy a more "elemental" kind of 
# existence, being as they are beings of pure substance and no true "life" or 
# "soul", not even the perverted and twisted unlife of the undead.

#   Take a look at the description of the "Angel" and "paladin" monsters. You might 
# realise why you're fighting "good" creatures... by the way, I changed the names of
# the monsters to "angel", "archangel", "cherub", "seraph" and "archon", on the 
# grounds that it's far cooler than "monadic deva" and "planetar" and suchlike.

#   Smeagol is far harder to nail down. But he may - just *might* - drop something
# nice. Or rob you blind when you can't see him.

#   A lot of inconsistencies have been cleared up, e.g. cave ogres being worth 
# fewer xp than black ogres, or acidic cytoplasms compared to gelatinous cubes. 
# And there are no "left-handed" dragons or hounds with one claw attack bigger than
# the other, nor do such monsters have one or three claw attacks, but two. All Qs are
# non-evil (with no intelligence, how can they be evil?) and natural, and have no 
# minds - not even the unique. Pazuzu, described as a demon, actually is one rather 
# than a "B"ird. Some non-uniques have escorts - mostly "captain" or "chieftain" 
# monsters, of which there are now several - for orcs, trolls, ogres and yeeks (the 
# ogre chieftain was the Ogre Shaman, the troll chieftain was the "Eldrak" formerly).
# Monster depths have been reworked so that the last unique in a race appears *after* 
# the last non-unique. Two monsters (formerly known as Muar and Murazor) have lost 
# their names, being simply the Balrog of Moria and the Witch-King of Angmar.

#   Exactly five more monsters have DROP_GREAT - all of them deep except for Mim. 
# (The others are Saruman, Vecna, the Witch-King and Glaurung.)

#   Dragons kick ass in melee combat.

#   Trolls regenerate, as in AD&D.

#   The Jabberwock is back, in place of the Chaos Beetle (which was simply a 
# renamed Jabberwock.) He is a multi-hued H on the grounds that I couldn't find
# any other category worth sticking him in - H will do for odds and ends.

#   For historical reasons, the Killer Iridescent Beetle is back as well - I 
# never liked his renaming to the killer Blue beetle.

#   Description and spelling of "Chimaera" corrected to proper Greek myth
# specs, and its three attacks are correct for the creatures: the goat-head 
# butts, the lion bites, the dragon burns. Also is significantly tougher - 
# far too wimpy as they stand. The original was supposed to be terrifying.

#   Gorgimaera (corrected spelling) also changed in similar fashion - the 
# goat butts, the dragon burns, the gorgon gazes to paralyze.

#   "Hippogriff" hybrid is purely eagle and horse, no lion. This was a simple
# error on the part of someone who doesn't know their myths well enough.

###### Changes for Unangband 0.12 and beyond

# Note that the monster list has undergone another reorganisation,
# mostly to balance the number of monsters in each category, so adding
# large numbers of new monsters isn't too unbalancing.

# The kobolds (k) were renamed goblins, and the high-level yeeks (y)
# merged with them. The multi-headed hydras (M) became the hydras (y).
# The angels (A) were renamed and become the Maiar (M), with one high
# level unique added from another category, with the ability to summon
# his fellows.
# The Quylthulgs (Q) are removed. The quadrepeds (q)
# became quadrepeds (Q). The spellcasting people (p) were moved to
# spellcasters (q). The lice (l) are added to the insects (I), and the
# elves (l) split from the demihumans (h). The flies (F) are added to
# the insects, and fish (F) becomes a new category. The Ancient
# dragons (D) become Ancient dragons (A) and mature dragons and drakes
# (D) are split from the young dragons (d). The Nightsbane (N) split
# from the wights and wraiths.

# Enough of yer whining.

# This results in the following:

# a - ants		A - Ancient dragons
# b - bats		B - Birds
# c - centipedes	C - Canines
# d - young dragons	D - mature Dragons/drakes
# e - eyes		E - Elementals
# f - felines		F - Fish
# g - golems		G - Ghosts
# h - demihumans	H - Hybrids
# i - icky things	I - Insects
# j - jellies		J - snakes
# k - goblins		K - beetles
# l - elves		L - ghouls/Liches
# m - molds		M - Maiar
# n - naga		N - Nightsbane
# o - orcs		O - Ogres
# p - people		P - giants
# q - people (spellcasters) Q - Quadrepeds
# r - rodents		R - reptiles
# s - skeletons		S - Spiders/ticks
# t - townspeople	T - trolls
# u - minor demons	U - major demons
# v - vortices		V - vampires
# w - worms		W - Wights/Wraiths
# x - unused		X - Xorn
# y - hydra		Y - apes/Yeti
# z - zombies/mummies	Z - Zephyr hounds

# The "people" (p & q), get a revised "color scheme" to account for the
# splitting of spell casters from non-spell casters. This matches some of
# the previous colour scheme.

# This possibly needs a revision. XXX XXX

# 'r' Novice mage 'R' Experienced mage 'v' Expert mage
# 'w' Novice druid 's' Experienced druid 'D' Expert druid
# 'W' Novice priest 'g' Experienced priest 'G' Expert priest
# 'u' Novice mystic 'U' Experienced mystic 'o' Expert mystic
# 'b' Novice mage (varient) 'B' Experienced mage (varient) 'y' Expert mage (varient)

# 'b' Rogue 'B' Experienced rogue 'y' Expert rogue
# 'w' Paladin 's' Experienced paladin 'D' Expert paladin
# 'W' Ranger 'g' Experienced ranger 'G' Expert ranger
# 'u' Warrior 'U' Experience warrior 'o' Expert warrior
# 'r' Thief 'R' Experienced thief 'v' Expert thief

# ==== Other changes ====

# Elementals of all types are 10 speed faster. The pure elementals also have
# a second spell or breath weapon of the appropriate elemental type. They
# should be less like golems as a result.

# Metallic dragons of all types have a 2nd breath weapon of a base type and
# the corresponding immunity. Gold have BR_POIS and IM_POIS and bronze have
# BR_FIRE and IM_FIRE. Dragon flies of the related type do not, but
# dragon bats, when added will do so.

# Spirit nagas should be worth 160.

# Added Zangband monsters, except silly, floor/wall/other odd monsters. Made some
# changes to bring them in line with Unangband monsters.

# === Understanding r_info.txt ===

# N: serial number : monster name
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : hit points : vision : armor class : alertness
# W: depth : rarity : unused (always 0) : experience for kill
# B: attack method : attack effect : damage
# S: spell frequency |
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: Description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 15 colors, as
# follows:

# D: "Black"	s: Grey		W: Light Grey 	w: White
# r: Red		R: Light Red	b: Blue		B: Light Blue
# g: Green		G: Light Green	u: Brown		U: Light Brown
# y: Yellow		o: Orange		v: Violet

#   Note that "D", meaning "black", is in fact a very dark grey rather than 
# a genuine black: this is, of course, because the background is black, and the
# monsters should be visible against the background. The color "d" may be used 
# for monsters which are not meant to be visible against the background, and are 
# thus a truly and totally black color: however, there are none such in the 
# standard version of Angband.

#   Note also that "multi-hued" is not a "color" (to be shown in the "G:" line)
# but a "flag", to be shown in the "F:" lines later: one line should read 
# "F:ATTR_MULTI" to make a multi-hued monster. It does not then matter what
# the color is as defined in the "G:" line, except for the purposes of how it 
# appears in the monster memory: all current "multi-hued" monsters default to 
# "v"iolet at the moment, and will appear as such in the monster memory.

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing. The third slot is unused, and always 0.

# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
# from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
# damage are optional.

# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:1_IN_X, meaning that 
# the monster has a 1 in X chance of casting a spell instead of moving 
# this turn, if the player is in its line of sight. Note, firstly, 
# (a) that X cannot be 0 as the result would involve division by zero, 
# and (b) if X=1, then this means a 1 in 1 chance, i.e. a certainty of
# casting a spell - if the player is in sight, the monster will not 
# move. This, particularly, makes physical attacks redundant on such 
# a monster, and so if you wish the monster to attack or move towards
# the player, X must be no less than 2, with the 1-in-1 chance reserved 
# for monsters which never attack in melee - for instance, druj.

# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
# are separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the monster. Note that lines may need spaces at their
# ends to prevent words from running together in the monster memory.


# Version stamp (required)

D:body scarred by Fingolfin's eight mighty wounds.  He can never rest from 
D:his pain, but seeks forever to dominate all that is light and good in the 
D:world.  He is the origin of man's fear of darkness and created many foul 
D:creatures with his evil powers.  Orcs, Dragons, and Trolls are his most 
D:foul corruptions, causing much pain and suffering in the world to please 
D:him.  His disgusting visage, twisted with evil, is crowned with iron, the 
D:two remaining Silmarils forever burning him.  Grond, the mighty Hammer of 
D:the Underworld, cries defiance as he strides towards you to crush you to a 
D:pulp!

#N:1100:Freca of Rohan
#G:p:
#D:An insolent and contemptuous chieftain of Rohan, and a man of mixed Rohirric
#D:and Dunlending blood.  Although distrusted by the King, he is both very rich
#D:and powerful due to his large land holdings near the Adorn.


#N:1101:Wulf, Invader of Rohan				[Human, Male]
#
#  The son of Freca and a renegade King of Rohan.  He is of mixed Rohirric and
#  Dunlending blood, and invaded Rohan with the aid of other enemies of the
#  Mark, including many Dunlendings.  There he slayed King Helm's son Haleth
#  before the very doors of the Golden Hall.


#N:1102:Ar-Adunakhor, Lord of the West			[Human, Male]
#
#  The twentieth King of Numenor.  He is the first King of Numenor to take
#  the sceptre with a title in the Adunaic tongue.  He has completely forbidden
#  the usage of Elven-tongues in his hearing.  His title is held by the Faithful
#  to be blasphemous, for it it is generally used to name one of the great
#  Valar only, Manwe especially.


#N:1103:Ar-Gimilzor of Numenor				[Human, Male]

#  The twenty-third King of Numenor.  He married Inzilbeth of Adunie despite
#  her wishes; the two sons of their unhappy marriage are Tar-Palantir and
#  Gimilkhad.  Ar-Gimilzor is a great enemy of the Faithful and has utterly
#  forbidden the use of Eldarin tongues.  Nor does he permit any of the Eldar
#  to come to the shores of Numenor, punishing those who welcome them.  He
#  reveres nothing and has neglected both the White Tree Nimloth and the Hallow
#  of Eru.


#N:1104:Gimilkhad of Numenor				[Human, Male]

#  He is the son of Ar-Gimilzor and brother to Tar-Palantir, the twenty-fourth
#  King of Numenor.  A strong, harsh, and ungentle man, he became the leader of
#  the King's Men when his brother Tar-Palantir came into power.  He opposes his
#  brother the King at every turn, as much as he dares in the open and much more
#  in secret.


#N:1105:Ar-Pharazon the Golden				[Human, Male]

#  The twenty-fifth King of Numenor.  He came into power by taking Queen Miriel
#  as his wife against her will and against the laws of Numenor, for she is the
#  daughter of his father's brother.  He then seized her sceptre into his own
#  hand and declared himself King.  Although he once "defeated" Sauron and took
#  him as hostage, Sauron eventually became his chief councillor.  Ar-Pharazon
#  was gradually corrupted by the words of Sauron, who became the true ruler of
#  Numenor.  Ar-Pharazon convinced his people to worship Morgoth and burned down
#  the White Tree Nimloth at Sauron's bidding.


#N:1106:Queen Beruthiel					[Human, Female]

#  wearing only black and silver.  She has nine black cats and one white, her
#  slaves with whom she converses.  She sets them to discover all the dark

#N:1117:Feanor, Leader of the Kinslaying		[Elf, Male]

#  The eldest son of Finwe, half-brother of Fingolfin and Finarfin.  Feanor
#  is the mightiest of the Noldor and in many ways the greatest of the Children
#  of Iluvatar, especially in skill of mind and hands.  Unfortunately, Feanor
#  is as quick to pride, jealousy, and anger as to invention.  Feanor grew
#  overly fond of his work and when the Two Trees were poisoned, he refused to
#  give up the Silmarils which preserved their light.  After Morgoth's murder of
#  Finwe and theft of the Silmarils, he swore the terrible Oath of Feanor with
#  his seven sons.  In his haste and pride he instigated the Kinslaying at
#  Alqualonde, the first slaying of Elf by Elf.  He vows never to rest until the
#  Silmarils are back in his hands.


#N:1118:Maedhros the Tall, Eldest Son of Feanor		[Elf, Male]

#  The eldest son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Maedhros swore the

#  of the Noldor.  More temperate than his father, he was a patient ruler and
#  strong warrior for many years.  But he remained driven by the Oath and
#  participated in the sacking of Doriath and the murders of Dior and Nimloth
#  in the Thousand Caves, the second slaying of Elf by Elf.  Maedhros still

#  of the Noldor.  More temperate than most of his brothers, he nevertheless
#  joined them in the invasion of Doriath and the murders of Dior and Nimloth.

#  of the Noldor.  Like his brothers, Celegorm is overly proud and acts more by
#  force than deceit.  When Finrod desired to aid Beren in the Quest of the
#  SIlmaril, Celegorm and his brother Curufin vowed their Oaths anew.  At
#  Celegorm's instigation, he and the rest of his brothers invaded Doriath and
#  murdered Dior and Nimloth in a vain attempt to regain a Silmaril.  This was

#  anger of the sons of Feanor.  He joined the rest of his brothers in the

#  of the Noldor.  Of the sons of Feanor, Curufin inherited most of his father's
#  skill, but was also cunning and treacherous.  When Finrod desired to aid

# Note that the monster list has undergone another reorganisation,
# mostly to balance the number of monsters in each category, so adding
# large numbers of new monsters isn't too unbalancing.

# The kobolds (k) were renamed goblins, and the high-level yeeks (y)
# merged with them. The multi-headed hydras (M) became the hydras (y).
# The angels (A) were renamed and become the Maear (M), with one high
# level unique added from another category, with the ability to summon
# his fellows.
# The Quylthulgs (Q) merged with the icky things. The quadrepeds (q)
# became quadrepeds (Q). The spellcasting people (p) were moved to
# spellcasters (q). The lice (l) are added to the insects (I), and the
# elves (l) split from the demihumans (h). The flies (F) are added to
# the insects, and fish (F) becomes a new category. The Ancient
# dragons (D) become Ancient dragons (A) and mature dragons and drakes
# (D) are split from the young dragons (d). The Nightsbane (N) split
# from the wights and wraiths.

# Enough of yer whining.

# This results in the following:

# a - ants		A - Ancient dragons
# b - bats		B - Birds
# c - centipedes	C - Canines
# d - young dragons	D - mature Dragons/drakes

Freca of Rohan					[Human, Male]

  An insolent and contemptuous chieftain of Rohan, and a man of mixed Rohirric
  and Dunlending blood.  Although distrusted by the King, he is both very rich
  and powerful due to his large land holdings near the Adorn.


Wulf, Invader of Rohan				[Human, Male, Evil]

  The son of Freca and a renegade King of Rohan.  He is of mixed Rohirric and
  Dunlending blood, and invaded Rohan with the aid of other enemies of the
  Mark, including many Dunlendings.  There he slayed King Helm's son Haleth
  before the very doors of the Golden Hall.


Ar-Adunakhor, Lord of the West			[Human, Male, Evil]

  The twentieth King of Numenor.  He is the first King of Numenor to take
  the sceptre with a title in the Adunaic tongue.  He has completely forbidden
  the usage of Elven-tongues in his hearing.  His title is held by the Faithful
  to be blasphemous, for it it is generally used to name one of the great
  Valar only, Manwe especially.


Ar-Gimilzor of Numenor				[Human, Male, Evil]

  The twenty-third King of Numenor.  He married Inzilbeth of Adunie despite
  her wishes; the two sons of their unhappy marriage are Tar-Palantir and
  Gimilkhad.  Ar-Gimilzor is a great enemy of the Faithful and has utterly
  forbidden the use of Eldarin tongues.  Nor does he permit any of the Eldar
  to come to the shores of Numenor, punishing those who welcome them.  He
  reveres nothing and has neglected both the White Tree Nimloth and the Hallow
  of Eru.


Gimilkhad of Numenor				[Human, Male, Evil]

  He is the son of Ar-Gimilzor and brother to Tar-Palantir, the twenty-fourth
  King of Numenor.  A strong, harsh, and ungentle man, he became the leader of
  the King's Men when his brother Tar-Palantir came into power.  He opposes his
  brother the King at every turn, as much as he dares in the open and much more
  in secret.


Ar-Pharazon the Golden				[Human, Male, Evil]

  The twenty-fifth King of Numenor.  He came into power by taking Queen Miriel
  as his wife against her will and against the laws of Numenor, for she is the
  daughter of his father's brother.  He then seized her sceptre into his own
  hand and declared himself King.  Although he once "defeated" Sauron and took
  him as hostage, Sauron eventually became his chief councillor.  Ar-Pharazon
  was gradually corrupted by the words of Sauron, who became the true ruler of
  Numenor.  Ar-Pharazon convinced his people to worship Morgoth and burned down
  the White Tree Nimloth at Sauron's bidding.


Queen Beruthiel					[Human, Female, Evil]

  The nefarious, solitary, and loveless Queen of Tarannon Falastar, twelfth
  King of Gondor.  She hates all making, colors, and elaborate adornment,
  wearing only black and silver.  She has nine black cats and one white, her
  slaves with whom she converses.  She sets them to discover all the dark
  secrets, so that she may know those things that men wish to keep most hidden.


The White Cat of Queen Beruthiel		[Cat, Female, Evil]

  The most powerful of the cats of Queen Beruthiel.  This cat is set by her
  to spy upon the nine black cats, tormenting them as well.


Fluithuin the Ogress, Consort of Morgoth	[Ogre, Female, Evil]

  <Insert description of a fierce Ogress, mentioning that she and Morgoth
   have relations together>


Feanor, Leader of the Kinslaying		[Elf, Male, Evil]

  The eldest son of Finwe, half-brother of Fingolfin and Finarfin.  Feanor
  is the mightiest of the Noldor and in many ways the greatest of the Children
  of Iluvatar, especially in skill of mind and hands.  Unfortunately, Feanor
  is as quick to pride, jealousy, and anger as to invention.  Feanor grew
  overly fond of his work and when the Two Trees were poisoned, he refused to
  give up the Silmarils which preserved their light.  After Morgoth's murder of
  Finwe and theft of the Silmarils, he swore the terrible Oath of Feanor with
  his seven sons.  In his haste and pride he instigated the Kinslaying at
  Alqualonde, the first slaying of Elf by Elf.  He vows never to rest until the
  Silmarils are back in his hands.


Maedhros the Tall, Eldest Son of Feanor		[Elf, Male]

  The eldest son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Maedhros swore the
  terrible Oath of Feanor with the rest of his brothers and joined the revolt
  of the Noldor.  More temperate than his father, he was a patient ruler and
  strong warrior for many years.  But he remained driven by the Oath and
  participated in the sacking of Doriath and the murders of Dior and Nimloth
  in the Thousand Caves, the second slaying of Elf by Elf.  Maedhros still
  vows never to rest until all three Silmarils are in the hands of his family.


Maglor the Singer, Son of Feanor		[Elf, Male]

  The second son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Maglor swore the
  terrible Oath of Feanor with the rest of his brothers and joined the revolt
  of the Noldor.  More temperate than most of his brothers, he nevertheless
  joined them in the invasion of Doriath and the murders of Dior and Nimloth.
  This was the second slaying of Elf by Elf.  Maglor still vows never to rest
  until all three Silmarils are in the hands of his family.


Celegorm the Fair, Son of Feanor		[Elf, Male, Evil]

  The third son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Celegorm swore the
  terrible Oath of Feanor with the rest of his brothers and joined the revolt
  of the Noldor.  Like his brothers, Celegorm is overly proud and acts more by
  force than deceit.  When Finrod desired to aid Beren in the Quest of the
  SIlmaril, Celegorm and his brother Curufin vowed their Oaths anew.  At
  Celegorm's instigation, he and the rest of his brothers invaded Doriath and
  murdered Dior and Nimloth in a vain attempt to regain a Silmaril.  This was
  the second slaying of Elf by Elf.  Celegorm still vows never to rest until
  all three Silmarils are in the hands of his family.


Caranthir the Dark, Son of Feanor		[Elf, Male, Evil]

  The fourth son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Caranthir swore the
  terrible Oath of Feanor with the rest of his brothers and joined the revolt
  of the Noldor.  Caranthir is very haughty, the harshest and most quick to
  anger of the sons of Feanor.  He joined the rest of his brothers in the
  invasion of Doriath and murders of Dior and Nimloth, the second slaying of
  Elf by Elf.  Caranthir still vows never to rest until all three Silmarils
  are in the hands of his family.


Curufin the Crafty, Son of Feanor		[Elf, Male, Evil]

  The fifth son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Curufin swore the
  terrible Oath of Feanor with the rest of his brothers and joined the revolt
  of the Noldor.  Of the sons of Feanor, Curufin inherited most of his father's
  skill, but was also cunning and treacherous.  When Finrod desired to aid
  Beren in the Quest of the Silmaril, Curufin and his brother Celegorm vowed
  their Oaths anew.  He joined th rest of his brothers in the invasion of
  Doriath and murder of Dior, the second slaying of Elf by Elf.  Curufin still
  vows never to rest until all three Silmarils are in the hands of his family.


Amrod, Son of Feanor				[Elf, Male]

  The twin brother of Amras and son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Amrod
  swore the terrible Oath of Feanor with the rest of his brothers and joined
  the revolt of the Noldor.  He joined the rest of his brothers in the attempt
  to recover a Silmaril by force from Elwing at the Havens of Sirion.  He is
  alike to his twin brother in both appearance and temperament.  Amrod still
  vows never to rest until all three Silmarils are in the hands of his family.


Amras, Son of Feanor				[Elf, Male]

  The twin brother of Amrod and son of Feanor, creator of the Silmarils.  Amras
  swore the terrible Oath of Feanor with the rest of his brothers and joined
  the revolt of the Noldor.  He joined the rest of his brothers in the attempt
  to recover a Silmaril by force from Elwing at the Havens of Sirion.  He is
  alike to his twin brother in both appearance and temperament.  Amras still
  vows never to rest until all three Silmarils are in the hands of his family.


Eol, the Dark Elf				[Elf, Male, Evil]

  An Elf of the Teleri, he is of the kin of Thingol.  He lives in the deep
  shadow of Nan Elmoth, where the trees are so tall and dark that the sun
  never comes.  There he dwells, loving the night and the twilight under the
  stars.  He learned his craft from his friends the Dwarves and is a great
  smith, being the inventor of the metal galvorn, and forger of the swords
  Anglachel and Anguirel.  He took his wife Aredhel Ar-Feiniel, the White
  Lady of Gondolin, by means of enchantment, and she bore him his son Maeglin.
  When his wife and son fled him to Gondolin he followed and attempted to
  take the life of his son with a poisoned javelin.  But his wife Aredhel
  stepped in front of the javelin, and died in his stead.


Maeglin, Betrayer of Gondolin			[Elf, Male]

  The son of Eol the Dark Elf and Aredhel Ar-Feiniel, the White Lady of
  Gondolin.  Maeglin `Sharp Glance' is a tall and dark-haired Elf, resembling
  in face and form his kindred the Noldor.  He has piercing dark eyes and
  white skin.  His thought can read the deepest secrets of hearts beyond the
  mist of words.  He was taken prisoner by Orcs beyond the hills of Gondolin,
  and was brought before Morgoth in Angband.  Due to his unreturned love for
  Idril and his jealous hatred of Tuor, Maeglin betrayed the location of the
  fair city of Gondolin as well as the ways by which it might be found and
  assailed.


Herumor, the Black Numenorean			[Human, Male, Evil]

  A renegade Numenorean and ally of Sauron.  He was corrupted by Sauron's many
  gifts and promises of great power.  He rose to become a great lord among the
  Haradrim, a great and cruel people who dwell in the wide lands south of
  Mordor beyond the mouths of Anduin.


Fuinur, the Black Numenorean			[Human, Male, Evil]

  A renegade Numenorean and ally of Sauron.  He was corrupted by Sauron's many
  gifts and promises of great power.  He rose to become a great lord among the
  Haradrim, a great and cruel people who dwell in the wide lands south of
  Mordor beyond the mouths of Anduin.

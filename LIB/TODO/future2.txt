
I'm particularly in limbo with regards to what to do next. Larry Bassel is still shaking bugs out of what I thought was a solid identification system, and my inclination seems to be moving more and more towards varied and interesting dungeon terrain and interaction, such as fountains, thrones, statues, curtains and so forth.

However, in order to supporting hiding behind the above objects (And a player invisibility system similar to Ninja stealth in Hengband), players summoning monsters and friendly uniques I'm going to have to do a major re-write of monster intelligence.

But at the same time, I want to wait around until Angband 3.0 comes out and put in a major effort upgrading the code base to match (And take advantage of the bug fixes and code clean up) before I drift too far away from it. That will also necessitate a long overdue clean up of the monsters and features (They are 'out of order' because of self-imposed restraints, which I didn't need to have), and info files in general (Although I'll deliberately maintain incompatibility with some of them, as I feel my format is more flexible). And I'll take advantage of this to make a lot of the 'variant options' compulsory. Hmmm... what to do.

...being a complete list of all the changes made to the info.txt files between Psiband 1.0.7 and Psiband 1.0.7b, as made by Jonathan Ellis.

##### CHANGES TO A_INFO.TXT #####

#   The One Ring is now *seriously* munchkinish. It has also been restored to 
# its former rarity. Other high resists added to the Three Rings, also restored to
# original rarity ratings.

#   RES_PSI added to the following items: Ingwe (also now gives an int boost),
# The One Ring, Bladeturner, Soulkeeper, Caspanion, the Massive Iron Crown, 
# Thengel, Holhenneth, Gondor, Thorongil, Theoden, Aeglos and some others. 

#   A few more high resists have been sprinkled around some of the rarer artifacts.
# And some of the really nasty weapons get extra attacks - for instance, Crisdurian
# (which slays everything and resists nothing - normally not worth using. Will now
# be *nice* for warriors - provided you are willing to not have any resists or stat
# boosts in the weapon slot, which is what most weapons end up being used for.)

#   And some other items have small speed boosts...

##### CHANGES TO E_INFO.TXT #####

#   Armor and Shields of Resist Poison! No more waiting for poison resistance at 
# 2000'... but Resist Poison does *NOT* occur on Resistance or Elvenkind armor.
#   From OAngband: Helmet of Serenity (resist confusion and sound), Boots of 
# Stability (resist nexus). And Cloaks of Protection now give shards resist, 
# rather than introduce a new type of cloak (also from OAngband.
#   Added ammo brands of Lightning and Acid.
#   Helmet of Brilliance - increases int and wis, telepathy, resistance to psionics.
# "Seeing" and "Infravision" have been combined into one to make room for this...
#   Helmets of the Magi and Lordliness also resist psionics. So do the new helmets
# of Serenity. (Think: something that allows you to keep your mind clear, without 
# confusions and distractions of noise.)
#   Boots of Speed now resist inertia, and the new (from OAngband) Boots of Stability
# resist gravity as well as nexus. Both of these seem logical enough...

### NOTE: new ego-types occupy slots 10, 21, 60, 120 and 121. The code must  ###
### be hacked to allow these items to be generated in the game, otherwise    ###
### they are just so much redundant text in this file. Most preferable would ###
### be hacking the code to allow *all* available slots to have an ego-item   ###
### in, and if an "empty" slot was generated then simply rerolling until a   ###
### "full" slot was generated.                                               ###

### ANOTHER NOTE: The new types of Helmet, and the new Cloak of Protection,  ###
### are in slots formerly occupied by different egos. Therefore, these will  ###
### be generated as standard: only the five ego-slots mentioned above are    ###
### needing code-hacking to allow their generation.                          ###

##### CHANGES TO K_INFO.TXT #####

#   As we know, psionic foci have been added to the list. Some objects have 
# gone in order to make room for them - most notably, the rings for sustaining 
# one single stat. (AH.) In place of this, those rings and amulets which add to
# one stat also now sustain that stat as well as giving a bonus to it. (JLE.)

#   RES_PSI added to some objects - Metapsionic foci, Amulets of the Magi.

#   Now, *all* third level foci are immune to destruction. But first and second
# level metapsionic foci can be destroyed by lightning.

#   Amulets of the Magi now give bonuses and sustains to int and wis.

#   Ring of Searching (useless) replaced by a much deeper and rarer Ring of 
# Sustaining (sustain all stats)

#   From my personalised version of vanilla: Poison resistance rings are now a 
# 2000' item, rings of speed 3500'.

##### CHANGES TO R_INFO.TXT #####
### From my own personalized version of vanilla Angband ###

#   Jabberwocks are back! In place of the Chaos beetle, and now a multi-hued "H".
# (This change comes from ZAngband.) The description has also been restored
# to its former glory.

#   "Pink" strength-draining monsters have gone back to "red". Where there is 
# confusion caused by two different types of the same "giant red" monster, the
# strength drainers are red and the fiery monsters have become "fire" monsters:
# giant fire ant, killer fire beetle, giant fire tick, and similar.

#   From ZAngband: Smeagol has 400 hp and DROP_GREAT 90% of the time.

#   All dragons are now evil (formerly, bronze and gold were not - neither were 
# Great Wyrms of Law and Balance, even though Law and Balance Drakes were evil),
# and none are natural (the Shadow Drake used to be) - with the exception of the 
# Dracolisk (allowed to remain natural because it is half basilisk.)

#   All Quylthulgs are now evil and natural (formerly, Quylthulgs and Nexus 
# Quylthulgs were not, but all others were, so this has been brought into line.)
# The Emperor Quylthulg summons more stuff and has EMPTY_MIND as well as being 
# multi-hued (to accord with his description.) 

#   Acidic cytoplasms were worth less xp than gelatinous cubes despite being far 
# nastier. Their xp value has been boosted by a factor of five.

#   Pazuzu is described as a demon twice: so he has been changed to a "U". The 
# Phoenix is now the king of all birds.

#   Some Dragon uniques have had Tolkienian breaths added: i.e. Ancalagon now 
# breathes fire as well as acid ("LotR" describes his dragonfire as the hottest 
# ever) and Glaurung now breathes poison as well as fire (his very presence is 
# foul and poisonous according to "The Silmarillion". Also see below for further
# dragon changes...

#   "Kobolds" now appear deeper and are worth more xp than "Small Kobolds".
# This was done simply by moving them from level 1 to 2 - it doubled the xp value
# at a stroke. They have slightly more hps as well.

#   Cave Ogres were worth less xp than Black Ogres despite being nastier: 
# likewise, Fire Giants were worth less than Frost Giants. This has been 
# corrected.

#   Orc captains have escorts. So do master yeeks. And the new monsters, troll
# and ogre chieftains (trolls and ogres being obviously tribal creatures, like orcs.)

#   Ogre Shamans have become chieftain-shamans, and have escorts. They have also 
# been swapped in depth with Lokkak (not a shaman: he rules his own tribe by
# brute force alone.)

#   Eldraks have become troll chieftains, and also have escorts. The depths of 
# Eldraks, Ettins and Rogrog the Black Troll have been swapped around a bit.
# Finally, the Spirit Troll has become a (G)host.

#   One thing has bugged me since Moria: clear icky things were worth only 1 xp,
# white icky things were worth 2 - despite the fact that clears are more dangerous
# simply because they are invisible. Their xp values have been reversed: whites
# are worth 1, clears are worth 2.

#   Undead beholders had four attacks, two of them non-damaging: normal beholders
# had four damaging attacks. Damage of 2d4 in each case has been added to the 
# undead beholder's non-damaging attacks.

#   The Tarrasque is now "natural".

#   Hound attacks have been changed. It seemed ridiculous that animals with one 
# mouth and two front claws should get three bites and one claw attack. So they 
# now (after nexus and vibration hounds, anyway) have two claws and two bites.
# Earlier hounds only bite, but up to three times in one round.

#   Vecna and Feagwath have been swapped: Feagwath is merely an undead sorcerer, 
# while Vecna (from AD&D) was powerful enough to challenge the gods and become one.

#   Colours of the two unique Liches have been changed as well: yellow and purple 
# (both were formerly the same colour as master liches. Other changed colours are:
# Mughash is red. Grishnakh and Golfimbul are yellow. Bolg and Azog are purple. 
# The Emperor Quylthulg is multi-hued.

#    Lugdush and Ugluk have been swapped: Ugluk was Lugdush's commander in LotR.

#   The Emperor Quylthulg now summons more stuff, and has EMPTY_MIND. 

#   Fewer monsters are right- or left-handed (i.e. having two claw/hit attacks, one
# much more powerful than the other.) Certainly not dragons or hounds.

#   Energy vortex stats have been equalized with the other elemental vortices: 
# previously they had more hps and more xp-value for no apparent reason.

#   "Muar" has become "The Balrog of Moria": "Murazor" has become simply "The 
# Witch-King of Angmar".

#   Two monsters have been made harder: the Balrog of Moria has had his original
# Moria speed of "very fast" returned to him, and xp value increased accordingly:
# and Glaurung is now "very fast" (in both cases, changed from "I:120.x.x.x.x"
# to "I:130.x.x.x.x".) and also has a higher xp value to match.

#   A few more monsters have the DROP_GREAT flag: they are sufficiently late in
# the game (with one exception) that this should not be unbalancing. They are:
#    The Witch-King (Lord of the Ringwraiths, surely has access to powerful magic)
#    Vecna (one of the most powerful liches of all time in AD&D)
#    Saruman (why should his servant have a better drop than he himself does?)
#    Glaurung (Father of the Dragons - dragon-hoards are legendary, and he did
#      have all of Nargothrond to choose from)
#    Mim (who had the pick of Nargothrond after Glaurung's death...)

#   Two descriptions changed: Gothmog (added the fact that he has slain three
# Noldorin High Kings - Feanor, Fingon and I've credited him with Turgon as well 
# since the fall of Gondolin, during which he was the commander of Morgoth's army)
# and Grape Jelly (added "Yum! It looks quite tasty")

#   Dragon melee attacks have been upgraded from vanilla. (But downgraded from 
# Psiband 1.0.7, where they were too powerful for the warrior class to melee them.)

#   Three new monsters have been added, including two uniques (Eol and Maeglin.) 
# Three old monsters have given way: Tiamat is gone, Ancalagon has her place as
# the greatest of dragonkind, Glaurung is now where Ancalagon used to be in the list 
# (I thought he deserved to be a lot more powerful than Itangast, Smaug, Scatha
# and normal Great Wyrms, instead of about the same level as Itangast) and 
# that leaves room for Eol at dungeon level 49 in the right order in the monster 
# list. The group-monster form of Hell Hound has gone, to be replaced by the 
# Greater Balrog (non-unique), and the functions of Carcharoth and Cerberus have
# been combined into one animal (under Carcharoth's name) to make room for 
# Maeglin. So two uniques and one non-unique have been replaced by two uniques
# and one non-unique.
# All the three new ones come straight from KAngband with only minor
# adjustments needed (such as the removal of flags that do not exist in the
# vanilla version of the game.)

### Psiband-specific changes ###

#   New Psionicist monsters added! The human ones are yellow (a colour not used
# in Ben Harrison's colour scheme for classes, e.g. red for mages, green for 
# priests). The replacements are as follows (I couldn't add new monsters to the 
# list, so some old ones had to go.)

#   Fundin Bluecloak replaced! He was originally the first winner of Angband (as 
# Evil Iggy was the first winner of Moria) so I have replaced him with the first
# known winner of recent versions of Psiband - Tar-Palantir the Wise, named after 
# the far-sighted Numenorean king of that name (my winner being a Dunadan 
# psionicist.)

#   Large grey snake replaced by Novice Psionicist (single monster). Novice 
# Archer (single) replaced by Novice Psionicist (group monster). Druid 
# replaced by Psionicist, Patriarch replaced by Master Psionicist. (Why do we 
# need yet another mid-level mage-type or high-level priest-type when there are 
# already loads?)

#   Mind flayers renamed "illithids" (the name comes from AD&D). Master illithids
# in place of the Dread group monster.

#   New unique: Ilsenine, the Illithid God-Brain - lord of the mind flayers.
# The two unique Q monsters combined into one (Qlzqqlzuup, the Emperor Quylthulg)
# to make room for Ilsenine. He, by the way, is light green (from the description
# in the AD&D "Monster Mythology" manual), thus breaking the colour scheme which
# has psionicists as normally being yellow.

#   Fewer monsters have psionic attacks compared to the original Psiband 1.0.7.

##### CHANGES TO V_INFO.TXT #####

# Slight changes: all lesser vaults have now at least two guaranteed "good" 
# items but each is guarded by a monster up to 9 levels out of depth (a few 
# "&" symbols have been changed to "9".) Similarly, a few more "8" symbols
# have been added to Greater Vaults: the four spaces in the middle of the 
# "Butterfly" and "Traps" vaults now have "8", and the three in the centre 
# of the central chamber in a "Chambers" vault. Again, the choice is the
# player's: go for the great objects and meet a monster up to 40 levels out
# of depth, or alternatively cut and run... I thought vaults should have at 
# least a couple of guaranteed "good" objects (lesser) or "great" (greater), 
# I don't like the concept of a vault with no good objects at all. Two "good" 
# surely isn't excessive for a lesser vault, nor three "great" for a greater 
# vault, considering that the items are guarded... -JLE.

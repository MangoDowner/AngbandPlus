Hint: This is context sensitive help. Hit space bar
to see an explanation of some messages you might
see appearing in the game.

Message: You hit it.
Message: You have killed it.
Message: It hits you.

You have encountered an unseen creature.

If you are blind, or without a source of light in the dungeon
or at night, you will not be able to see any creatures. Try
'w'ielding a torch or lantern, or 'q'uaffing a potion to cure
your blindness.

The dungeon of UnAngband has a large number of creatures that
are hard to see in some way.

Invisible warm-blooded creatures will be seen if you have
infravision and they are within range.

Invisible cold-blooded creatures are only visible if you have
the ability to see invisible creatures. You can get this
ability temporarily from a potion or spell, or while you are
wielding or wearing an item that grants the ability to see
invisible creatures.

Hidden monsters are protected from your line of sight, so that
many spell attacks are useless against them.

Swimming monsters are hidden by deep water, and burrowing
monsters are hidden by deep sand and earth.

Various detection items and spells will allow you to very
briefly see hidden and invisible monsters.

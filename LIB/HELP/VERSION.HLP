=== Version Info -- Angband 2.7.6 ===

Make sure to read the newsgroup "rec.games.roguelike.angband" if possible.

You are currently playing Angband 2.7.6 (or higher).  Angband 2.7.X began as
a set of extensive modifications to MacAngband 2.6.1, performed by myself
(Ben Harrison, benh@linc.cis.upenn.edu) just prior to the departure of the
previous maintainer, Charles Swiger.  I was thus able to step in as the new
Angband maintainer, and appear to have been accepted as "official".

The most important modification was a massive "code level cleanup" that made
all of my other modifications much simpler and safer.  This cleanup was so
massive that the code is no longer recognizable, for example, via "diff -r".

The second most important modification was the construction of a generic "Term"
package, which allows Angband to be ported to a new machine with as few as 50
lines of code.  Angband 2.7.6 thus runs without modification on many machines,
including Macintosh, PowerMacs, Unix/X11, Unix/Curses, DOS-386, OS2-386,
Windows, and Amiga.  The only important missing port seems to be DOS-286.

=== Some of the changes from Angband 2.6.1 to Angband 2.7.6 ===

It would be difficult to list all of the changes between Angband 2.6.1 and
Angband 2.7.6, because many of them were made in passing during the massive
code level cleanup.  Many of the changes are invisible to the user, but still
provide increased simplicity and efficiency, and decreased code size, or make
other more visable changes possible.  For example, the new "project()" code
that handles all bolts, beams, and balls, the new "update_view()" code that
simplifies line of sight computation, or the new "generate()" code that builds
new levels in the dungeon.  Many changes have been made to increase efficiency,
including the new "process_monsters()" and "update_monsters()" functions, and
the new "objdes()" and "lite_spot()" routines.  The generic "Term" package
yielded efficient screen updates, and enabled the simple use of "color".

Some other important changes that come to mind include: macros, pref files,
redefinable attr/char pairs, inventory tagging, many new runtime options,
the bow slot, object stacking, recall/choice windows, parsing template files, 
special lighting effects, intelligent monsters, etc.

For fun, I designed the "Borg", an automatic Angband player.

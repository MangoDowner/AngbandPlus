=== Races ===

There are ten different races that you can choose from in Angband.  Some
races are restricted as to what profession they may be, and each race has
its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities. Most races also
have intrinsic abilities.

Human
     The human is the base character.  All other races are compared to them.
     Humans can choose any class and are average at everything.  Humans tend
     to go up levels faster than any other race because of their shorter life
     spans.  No racial adjustments or intrinsics occur to characters choosing
     human.

Half-Elf
     Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than humans but not as strong.
     Half-elves are slightly better at searching, disarming, saving throws,
     stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.
     Half-elves may choose any class and do not receive any intrinsic
     abilities.

Elf
     Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as good at fighting.
     They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans or half-elves and
     also have better wisdom.  Elves are better at searching, disarming,
     perception, stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand
     weapons.  Elves may choose any class except Paladin.  They resist light
     effects intrinsically.

Hobbits
     Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at bows, throwing, and have good
     saving throws.  They also are very good at searching, disarming,
     perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to
     be called burglars.  They will be much weaker than humans, and no good
     at melee fighting.  Halflings have fair infravision, so they can detect
     warm creatures at a distance.  Hobbits can choose between being a
     warrior, mage, or rogue.  They have their dexterity sustained.

Gnome
     Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like
     the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes.  Gnomes make
     excellent mages, and have very good saving throws.  They are good at
     searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They have lower strength
     than humans so they are not very good at fighting with hand weapons.
     Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm-blooded creatures
     at a distance.  A gnome may choose between being a warrior, mage,
     priest, or rogue.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected against paralysis
     and some slowing effects.

Dwarf
     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend.  Since
     dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices
     for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves tend to be stronger and tougher but
     slower and less intelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong
     and are somewhat wise, they often resist spells which are cast on them.
     Dwarves also have very good infra-vision because they live underground.
     They do have one big drawback, though.  Dwarves are loudmouthed and
     proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good
     reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.  In other words,
     dwarves have a miserable stealth.  They can never be blinded. 

Half-Orc
     Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are terrible
     at magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at
     searching, disarming, and perception.  Half-Orcs are, let's face it,
     ugly.  They tend to pay more for goods in town.  Half-Orcs do make good
     warriors and rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have
     great constitutions and lots of hit points.  Because of their preference
     to living underground to on the surface, half-orcs resist darkness
     attacks.

Half-Troll
     Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than any
     other character race.  They are also very stupid and slow.  They will
     make great warriors and iffy priests.  They are bad at searching,
     disarming, perception, and stealth.  They are so ugly that a Half-Orc
     grimaces in their presence.  They also happen to be fun to run...
     Half-trolls always have their strength sustained.

Dunadan
     Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West.  This elder race
     surpasses human abilities in every field, especially constitution.
     However, being men of the world, very little is new to them, and levels
     are very hard to gain...  They can play all classes.  Their constitution
     cannot be reduced.

High-Elf
     High-elves are a race of immortal beings dating from the beginning of
     time.  Levels are even harder for them to gain than to Dunedain.  They
     are masters of all skills, and are strong and intelligent, although
     their wisdom is sometimes suspect.  They can play all classes except
     Paladin, and very well at that.  High-elves begin their lives able to
     see the unseen, and they resist light effects just like regular elves.

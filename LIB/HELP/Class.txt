=== Classes ===
 
 
Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  Some classes
will not be available to certain races.  For instance, a Half-Troll cannot
become a Paladin.  For the first few adventures it is suggested that you run
a warrior or rogue.  Spell casting generally requires a more experienced
player familiar with survival techniques.

Warrior
     A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character who solves most of his problems
     by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help
     of a magical device.   His prime stats are Strength and Constitution,
     and a good Dexterity can really help at times.  A Warrior will be good
     at Fighting and Throwing/Bows, but bad at most other skills.

Mage
     A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack his way
     through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
     deceive, confuse, and escape.  A mage is not really complete without an
     assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells.  He can
     master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else
     and has a good saving throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.
     Intelligence and Dexterity are his primary stats.  There is no rule
     that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true
     realm.

Priest
     A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  Priests explore the dungeon
     only to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens
     to fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their
     church!  Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do
     not choose which spells they will learn.  They are familiar with
     magical devices, preferring to call them instruments of their god, but
     are not as good as a mage in their use.  Priests have good saving
     throws and make decent fighters, preferring blunt weapons over edged
     ones.  Wisdom and Charisma are the priest's primary stats.

Rogue
     A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is
     capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is the master of
     traps and locks, no device being impossible for him to overcome.  A
     rogue has a high stealth, allowing him to sneak around many creatures
     without having to fight, or sneak up and get the first blow.  A rogue's
     perception is higher than any other class, and many times he will
     notice a trap or secret door before having to search.  A rogue is
     better than warriors or paladins with magical devices, but still can
     not rely on their performance.  Rogues can also learn a few spells,
     but not the powerful offensive spells magi can use.  A rogue's primary
     stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.

Ranger
     A Ranger is a warrior/mage.  He is a good fighter, and the best of the
     classes with a missile weapon such as a bow.  The ranger learns spells
     much more slowly than a mage, but is capable of learning all but the
     most powerful spells.  Because a ranger is really a dual class
     character, more experience is required for him to advance.  A ranger
     has a good stealth, good perception, good searching, a good saving
     throw, and is good with magical devices.  His primary stats are
     Intelligence and Dexterity.

Paladin
     A Paladin is a warrior/priest.  He is a very good fighter, second only
     to the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons.  He
     receives prayers at a slower pace then the priest, but can even receive
     the most powerful prayers.  Because a paladin is really a dual class
     character, it requires more experience to advance him.  A paladin
     lacks much in the way of abilities.  He is poor at stealth, perception,
     searching, and magical devices.  He has a decent saving throw due to
     his divine alliance.  His primary stats are Strength and Charisma.

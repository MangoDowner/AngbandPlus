=== Using the online help ===

You can press Escape at any time to leave the online help.

You can press '?' to return to the previous help file.

You can press Space to advance one page, or '>' to advance one line.
If you reach the end of the help file, you will wrap around to the start.

You can press '.' to back up one page, or '<' to back up one line.
If you reach the beginning of the help file, you will wrap to the last page.

The Rangband controls have been changed to maintain consistency with the
inventory system.

You can press '#' to go to a specific line (defaults to line zero).

You can press '%' to go to a specific file (defaults to "help.hlp").

You can press '/' to search for a string.  This is a very primitive case
sensitive search.  Slash followed by return will search for the previous
search string again.  The search does not wrap around at the end of the file.
To search again from the top, use '#' to go to the top and search again.

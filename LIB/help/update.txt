Cthangband
Based on Zangband 2.1.0e

Changes are added to the top of this file, so for a chronological order
read from the bottom up.

Cthangband 4.0.1
* Wizard Mode moved to 'Cheat Options' page.
* 'graf-new' flag removed since we only have Adam Bolt tiles these days.
* Paths are now lit like floors.
* Startup options have their own option page, to reduce the number of
  questions the player is asked when creating a new character.
* Dungeons (but not towers) display offset depth, rather than true
  depth.
* Player ghosts now use graphics if possible.
* 'Dungeons' may now be towers (tiny levels heading upwards) as well as
  caves (larger levels heading downwards).
* 5 new dungeons added.
* Dungeons now have a 'bias' towards a certain type of creature.
* Charm destruction and identify staff bugs fixed (thanks to Greg
  Wooledge).
* Bug in spell energy calculation fixed.
* Skills can only be improved if you are not bored (i.e. there is a
  minimum depth requirement based on your current skill value.)
* Hedge magic is now easier to learn.
* Skills are now slightly randomised on character generation.
* Fixed bug with 100% Toughness reducing your hitpoints.
* Spirits now have elvish/hobbitish names, rather than Cthuloid.
* Character dump now dumps last 10 messages (so you can see how stupidly
  you died).
* Problem with 'missing' options fixed.
* 'Wizard Mode' flag is cleared with cheat flags on character creation.
* Extra cheat option - 'cheat_skll' to view skill checks.
* Toughness is only increased when you lose more than 1/20th of your
  current hit points in a single hit.
* Magic skills only improve if there was a 10% failure chance (or
  greater) for the spell/favour/power/cantrip.
* No experience is gained on the surface, only in dungeons
* Attacks only improve your attack skill (and/or martial arts) if you
  have less than 75% chance to hit.
* Attacks with mutations (Horns, Tail etc.) give experience to your
  'close combat' skill, not your weapon skill.

Cthangband 4.0.0
* Windows version has updated menus and faster repaints and can now use
  monospaced system fonts as well as bitmap fonts. (From Tim Baker's
  version of Kamband.)

  dragon breath' now use cone shaped attacks.

* Monster breaths are now cone shaped, rather than ball shaped (from
  Zangband)
* Speed system cleaned up (a lot) with regard to spellcasting.
* 'help.hlp' is now system specific ('help-dos.hlp' etc.) so that it can
  point to a different set of files for the different interfaces and
  systems.
* Windows version asks for a savefile name when starting a new file,
  rather than automatically naming it after the character that is
  generated.

  Savefile' and 'Load Savefile' as some people were confused and thought
  that they needed to use the 'New Game' command after they had died.

  been unified into a single 'u'se command that will do whatever is most
  appropriate for the item

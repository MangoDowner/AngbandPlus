Q: How do I use the altars (the 'O's) I see in the dungeon?  

A: PernAngband introduces a new system of gods. Each god has one
dedicated altar.  At the beginning of the game, only Priests, Priors
and Paladins worship a god.  Everyone else may choose if they
want to or not.  Sacrifice('O' key while on an altar) good objects
sufficiently often to your chosen god and he or she will grant
potentially valuable advantages, as appropriate for that god.
But beware!  If you don't sacrifice often enough your god will
eventually get angry and try to kill you!  Also when you have
a religion it's difficult and dangerous to change so choose wisely.
You can also try to bash altars of other gods, but it's rather
dangerous. 
You can also press 'p' to pray to your god if you're in good grace with
him/her.

Q: Why do I have -200 to hit and to damage ?

A: Because you are a Sorcerer. They can't wield any weapon, unless it's
a Mage
Staff and even bare-handed they are very bad.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: A Sorcerer is supposed to be able to use every realm of magic, right
?
So why am I asked to choose 2 realms when I create one?

A: Yes, a Sorcerer can use every realm, but the 2 realms you select at
character birth also determine the two beginner's spellbooks you start out
with.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: I've found some strange items like a Red Tome, a Voodoo Doll, ...
What can I do with that ?

A: You've found an unusual artifact that cannot be wielded, but always
has a sometimes-useful activation.  It will not be listed in the known
artifact
list and its activation is totally random.  It's also recommended that
this kind of artifact be *identified* before use since the
activation can be something like death, stat loss, ...

Q: I spent 500 gp at the Soothsayer but she said nothing. Is it a
bug ?

A: No.  Nor is it because Soothsayers are swindlers.  She said nothing
because
you have no fate at this moment.  You gain fate while playing, and will
be warned by a message such as "You feel your fate has changed".  A fate
can be
useless like finding a broken skull at level 30, deadly like dying at
level
56, or really useful like to never die by the hand of a mortal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Why can't I pick up monster corpses ?

A: You must set an option in the PernAngband play options to allow it. It's
disallowed by default to avoid being killed by picking up something heavy like a Great Wyrm of Power corpse, suddenly dropping to -500 speed, and dying nastily.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Who is Mathilde, the Science Student whom I see every so often in the
town?

A: Most of the time she laughs and giggles, she has no loot on her, and
she's never done you any harm.  So leave her be - even if she should
happen to shout "Drop dead, creep!".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: I can't find any way out of the first room in the Thieves quest ! help !

A: First you need the python support to be compiled.
And then just stand at the upper right corner and search for a long time here.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: My wrists hurt a lot when playing the game. Should I take precautions?

A: Yes, you should. Repetitive strain on wrists (which results from a badly
   placed keyboard, for example) can lead to serious injury of the wrist
   ligaments called Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. If you feel your wrists
   are strained, here is an exercise posted by Jason Maskell in 
   rec.games.roguelike.angband which might help:

   ``Hold your arms out horizontally, make a fist, and then point
   the fist towards the floor, as much as you can. This will
   stretch one side's tendons. Hold for 5 seconds. Then make a
   flat hand and hold it level with your arm, hold for 5 seconds.
   Now splay your fingers and attempt to make your hand point
   toward the ceiling (this one is hard, so don't push it too
   much). You should feel your tendons stretching. Repeat this a
   few times. Take frequent breaks and do this if it starts to hurt
   a little bit. I was sliding very fast towards CTS and this
   corrected it.''

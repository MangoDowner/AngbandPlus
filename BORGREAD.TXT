
Greetings my friends and welcome to the world of mindless dribble.
This source code will enable you to spend countless hours staring
at your computer when you should be doing something more productive,
anything more productive.

To install this borg, you will need to do the following:
1.  Modify the config.h to uncomment:
        a. the allow_borg line
        b. the score_borg line
        c. the allow_borg_graphics line
2.  Modify the makefile to include the borg1.o (or borg1.obj if windows)
    though borg9.o
3.  Modify your angband.ini file if you want to run continuous play borgs.
    You can cut and paste from below.
4.  Compile

The borg may get stuck in certain situations.  He may have a Clock Overflow.
He may loop buying and selling the same stuff over and over.  Believe me
when I say that these have been addressed.  His loops are greatly reduced.


Continuous Play Mode: (option)
Upon the death of a borg, he will automatically reroll a random character,
with a random name and start fresh from clevel 1.  To enable the Continuous
Play Mode, turn the game option cheat_live on.  To do that enter the
options by pressing the equal sign (=) then Cheat Options (6).

If you want, you can tell the borg to select a certain race and or class for
the next one rolled up.  There are two ways of doing this.  You can modify
the angand.ini file (see the sample below) or you can modify the borg1.c
file in the appropriate place.  It is near the top, you should be able to
easily find it.

The Continual Play Mode is NOT turned on by default, you will need to
select it.

This borg is updated just about everyday.  You can get the lastest source
as well as executables at http://itctel.com/~apwhite/andrew.html

Have Fun,
Dr. Andrew White

Here is a sample of what you may want to paste into your angband.ini file:

[Borg]
# If the borg is in continual play mode (as with the screen saver),
# he will respawn a randomly generated character at death.  This section
# allows the user to make certain bias for the type of character generated.
# You may select the race and or class and or minimal stats for the Borg.
# You may also select the minimal character level needed before the
# character dump is created in the game directory.
#
# With regards to race, the borg is programmed to accept the variety of
# user defined races which may be in the p_info.txt file.  So the values
# given in table below are for the default races.  But if you are bright
# enough to modify the p_info.txt file then you are bright enough to figure
# out that race 0 does not necessarily equal Human.  It's just the first
# race listed in your p_info.txt file.
#
# RACE:-1 Random Race          CLASS:  -1 Random Class
#       0 Human                         0 Warrior
#       1 Half Elf                      1 Mage
#       2 Elf                           2 Priest
#       3 Hobbit                        3 Rogue
#       4 Gnome                         4 Ranger
#       5 Dwarf                         5 Paladin
#       6 Half Orc
#       7 Half Troll
#       8 Dunadan
#       9 High Elf
#
# With regards to the stats.  The number listed in this .ini file will be
# the minimal stat amount used in the auto roller.  Don't make it too high
# for each or the game will loop for a very long time waiting for the
# right combination.  If your selections are out of reach for the RNG, then
# after 32,000 tries the game will just assign you a random stat.

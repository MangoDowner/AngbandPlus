This document lists the changes made in SBFband (in comparison to Zangband 2.2.3d).
See the code for more details.  This list is in reverse chronological order.

Description: SBFband replaces the Zelazny-themed material of Zangband
with material drawn from the works of David Eddings (the Belgariad,
the Malloreon, etc.) and the anime Record of Lodoss War.  It also has 
some classes improve in stealth with experience, makes the character 
buy their house(s), and adds new races, artifacts, and ego-items.

NOTE: I am currently looking for quests, towns, vaults, and interesting rooms to add to the next version of SBFband.  Send them to Sperlock74@yahoo.com.  I'll look at them and will choose some (maybe all!) of them to put into the next version (after minor balancing and other tweaks, if necessary).  Credit will be given!

Reported but unfixed bugs:
An '&' object has appeared as '(nothing)' (from flavor.c, object_desc function) and is probably related to 'The Unknown Artifact' (from cmd4.c, do_cmd_knowledge_artifacts function) bug that has been reported.  This relates to the artifact 'the Amulet of Beldaran.'

 	frequency of consecutive teleports "bouncing" the player between two or
 	three different spots (also from GWAngband).

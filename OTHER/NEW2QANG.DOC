Additions in QAngband (Quiver Angband) to standard Angband (PC) 1.4
::::: Beginning with version 1.4.1 :::::::::::
 0) For systems with no or insufficient EMS memory for swapping purposes,
    XMS memory, if available, will be used instead.  Since some programs
    appropriate XMS memory in a way other programs cannot detect, adding
    "-x" immediately after the program on the commandline will disable the
    otherwise automatic usage to prevent conflicts.  On startup, the very
    first message displayed will be, "Angband is using XMS memory" when XMS
    will be used.  If this message scrolls off the screen to quickly to be
    seen simply call up the usage summary screen with a command line option
    like "-h" to see if XMS usage is on.  (Angband displays a summary of all
    available command line options if it is started with an improper command
    line.)

 1) A quiver, like that in FAngband but without the bugs, has been included.
    Simply (w)ear/wield missle ammo and it will be placed in the quiver slot
    for convenient (f)iring at monsters.  If you wish to change ammo simply
    (w)ear/wield different ammo.  If you want to unload the quiver (T/t)ake
    off the ammo.  Missle ammo can still be improved with Enchant Scrolls by
    placing the desired ammo in the Quiver slot and _unwielding_ the weapon
    in the Weapon slot; Enchant scrolls will enchant the contents of the 
    Weapon slot, or the Quiver slot if no weapon is wielded, or be wasted
    if both are empty.  Some traditional UMoria/Angband commands were moved
    to new keystrokes to allow the quiver a mneumonic (f)ire ammo command.
      [FAngband note: Due to wide spread complaints, FAngband 1.0's 
       simpler reassignment scheme of using s for (s)hoot from quiver 
       and moving the older (s)earch n turns to (I)nvestigate n turns
       was not adopted.]
    A summary of reassignments of command keystokes follows:
        NEW KEYSTROKE SUMMARY        ORIGINAL MODE     ROGUE MODE
    Search nearby for n turns:         s --> s (not I)   s --> s (not I)
    Fire ammo from the quiver:         ----> f           ----> f
    Throw an item normally:            f --> F           t --> t
    Bash a door or monster:            B --> B           f --> F
    Put more oil in a lamp:            F --> O           F --> O

 2) Charisma has been given a new effect in game play; A charisma bonus
    of randomly varying size is given to the duration of those magical
    effects from spells/prayers/potions/scrolls/wands/staves/artifacts
    which last a set length of time.  The following are affected:
        MAGICAL EFFECT                     BONUS POTENCY
    Temporary elemental resistances          Full
    Timed Detect Invisible                   Full
    Heroism and Superheroism/Berserker       Full
    Blessing type fighting effects           Full
    Protection from Evil                     Full
    Shield (advanced mage spell)             Full
    Temporary speed increase                 Reduced
    Globe of Invulnerability                 Small
    Glyph of Warding/Rune of Protection      Powerful

    The size of this bonus depends upon a player's charisma and level as 
    well as the luck of the draw at a particular moment.  A player must 
    have a charisma of at least 15 to have a chance at any bonus.  The 
    maximum possible effect grows with increases in charisma and level.  
    Really noticable effects do not occur until charisma is well above 18 
    and strong effects require a charisma above 18/100.  As the chart 
    above indicates some spells are more strongly influenced than others.
    The GoW/RoP is a special case in that the charisma bonus helps the 
    Glyph/Rune resist being broken by a monster rather than giving a preset 
    increase to duration; The GoW/RoP is actually useful again!!  I have
    raised the price of Potions of Charisma to half that of the other Gain
    Potions because Charisma is no longer practically useless but is useful
    as a side effect more than for its base use.  For more detailed 
    information consult the spoiler file, chrbonus.spo.

    The rationale in making this depend on charisma is that this stat is 
    currently much less important than the others to all character classes.  
    Philosophically I propose an extension of the current interpretation
    of charisma, ie. (physical) popularity, to include something like 
    divine favor.  This is not too say that Iluvatar (GOD) is influenced 
    by popularity, but that the charismatic ability to inspire others is 
    consciously if subtly bestowed by Iluvatar as a blessing for innate 
    goodness.

 3) Every character type now can have access to the Globe of Invulnerabity,
    ie. GoI.  The UMoria-style Potion of Invulnerability has been restored 
    as a very rare and costly potion that begins showing up at level 50.  
    Also, the Power Dragon Scale Mail artifact, Bladeturner, now grants 
    GoI sometimes in _addition to_ its usual effects; This should settle
    the question of whether Bladeturner is better than a generic PDSM.
    However, in an attempt to balance the awesome power of GoI, a casting/
    quaffing/activation of GoI will now have a small chance of misfiring 
    for a Word of Destruction effect instead.  As is usual for WoD, any 
    artifacts in the blast zone will be safe, but all monsters and other
    treasures (except perhaps under you??) will be destroyed.  This has
    the effect of keeping the character safe, as GoI is intended to do,
    but makes it harder to depend on GoI to slay monsters that otherwise
    are too high in level.  Since the GoI is affected by the new bonus 
    for charisma and level, more detailed information can be found in 
    spoiler file, chrbonus.spo.

    Also, the "skin turns to steel" and "skin returns to normal" messages 
    and the on-screen display of current hit points while a character is 
    invulnerable will be printed in white.  The screen wrapping feature
    introduced in Angband 1.4 makes it very easy to miss the important
    message "your skin returns to normal" in the heat of battle.

 5) Along the example of UNIX Angband 2.x.y some artifact armors have new
    exotic/higher resistances and Sting has been improved.  Consult the
    enclosed artifact.spo spoiler file for more details; Search for my
    annotations in {}.  Note only newly created artifacts are effected by
    these changes.

 6) Elvenkind armors get 1 and Robes of the Magi (RoM) get 1 to 2 higher
    resistances added to them at random (much in the way a Holy Avenger
    will sustain one stat at random).  This change is intended to help
    these rare armors compete with the somewhat less rare Dragon Scale
    Mails (DSMs).  The additional resistance(s) will come from the set: 
        Resist Poison, Resist Confusion, Resist Sound, 
        Resist Light, Resist Dark, Resist Chaos, Resist Disenchantment, 
        Resist Shards, Resist Nexus, Resist Nether

 7) Adamantite armor now has intrinsic Resist Nexus.  Anyone who willingly
    wears heavy, -4 to hit armor should get some reward.  Since Nexus has
    very annoying side effects (and Adamantite armor and Nexus blasts are
    both purple!) this seemed a reasonable choice.

 8) A Rod of Wall Building similar to the wand of the same name in UMoria
    has been added.  A quite long recharge time should limit the use of
    this as a weapon ala UMoria; This is especially long to prevent mages
    from conveniently recharging them with Recharge spells.  It takes 3
    successful recharge spells/scrolls to fully recharge one, though at
    the expense of making the timeout length mildly ridiculous.  However, 
    these rods are only intended to provide a respite from very persistent 
    monsters who cannot be stopped by spiked doors not as an entombing 
    attack.

 9) Cubragol is now an x4 light crossbow so it compares more favorably to
    heavy crossbows of might x5 in fire power (after all it is an artifact).
    For those who already possess Cubragol, activating it in QAngband will
    patch the damage from x3 to x4.  Also, Cubragol's activation has been 
    tweaked so the first normal bolts found in the pack or quiver will be 
    enchanted; Standard PC Angband can only enchant the topmost bolts in 
    the pack (as determined by alphabetic sequence).
::::: Beginning with version 1.4.2 :::::::::::
 1) Bug Fix: Not surprisingly, despite extensive playing of QAngband and 
    its ancestors with the quiver code, a _minor_ bug turned up soon 
    after its first release.  The problem, a loading irregularity, is the 
    only quiver-related bug I have run across in some time.
    
    Bug Description: If an item known to be {cursed} was in slot 'v' of 
    the inventory, the message "The <blank> you are storing appears to be 
    cursed." was displayed whenever one tried to load the quiver.  This
    happened because of absolute slot, inventory[INVEN_QUIVER]'s dual use
    as quiver and slot 'v'; the code checked whether something {cursed}
    was in this slot even if it were currently in use as slot 'v'.

 2) While fixing the above glitch, I have taken the time to see to some
    minor coding I was putting off.  I have decided to continue to allow 
    {cursed} ammo to be fired from the quiver, but in line with its cursed
    nature, any ammo that is {cursed} will "stick" sometimes.  When this 
    happens the message, "The <blank> you are storing in your quiver must 
    be cursed.", will be displayed, nothing will be fired, and the turn 
    will be wasted.  Also, I noticed that because the quiver holds multiple 
    objects some of the equiptment messages used bad grammar, such as "The
    bolts seems to be cursed", for instance.  I have cleaned up a number of
    these.

 3) I have improved command line argument processing for the included 4dos
    batch file front end to Angband.  The options can now be in any order
    and can be grouped, ie. -qn for -q -n.  The usage is now:
        qangrun <options> <name> <options> <password> <options>
    where the only requirement is that <name> come before <password>.

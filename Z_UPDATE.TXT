This is a document file listing the changes in Zangband (compared to the

details. In reversed chronological order (more or less):


ZAngband 2.2.0
-Added 279 new monsters and the corresponding 8x8 sized tiles designed and

 Hanrihan.

 generator from KAmband.

ZAngband 2.1.1c

 a hobbit, but it was still a bug. ;-)
-Fixed another bug in the creation of quest levels.
-Allowed all characters created in pre 2.1.1 versions of ZAngband to
 choose the number of quests when loading the savegame. You may have to
 leave and reenter the current level, if it's a quest level.
-Only Uniques will now resist disintegration effects.
-The last questmonster now drops all carried items, the normal monster
 drop and one reward item when you finish the quest.

-Reflection works now.
-Corrected the new tiles for spirit naga, angel, and blue jellies.

ZAngband 2.1.1

-Another bug in the quest code fixed.
-Quest messages are now correctly pluralized.

 power/mutation (the O key) work now.
-Benny S. Hofmann's patch to the windows version allows switching between ASCII,
 old tiles and Adam Bolt's tiles.
-Toned down the TY-curse a bit.

ZAngband 2.1.1 beta 2
-Updated Adam Bolt's terrain tiles again.
-Implemented the item flavoring code from Angband 2.8.3.
-Fixed a bug in the macro-creation.

 and don't crash the game anymore.

 new tiles. Just define "USE_AB_TILES" and compile it.
 The windows version also supports transparency and the
 "double-step bug" is fixed.
-Added a sound-event for the "Hitpoint Warning".
-Pets will no longer pick up/destroy items.
-Implemented Greg Harvey's patch that adds the macro code from 2.8.3.

 Dean Anderson.


Zangband 2.1.0e
-Fixed some bugs with the new bookstore and the store maintainance and
 owner shuffling works for the bookstore.
-Fixed the problem with compiling the main.c file on Unix/Linux systems.


Zangband 2.1.0d
-Silas Dunsmore's cumulative light radius patch added.
 Any object in your equipment that has the 'glow' flag will extend your
 lit-area radius by 1, up to a maximum of 5.  The normal light-source
 objects still work the same, but glowing artifacts and helms of light
 are actually useful.
-Added a bookstore to the town to free up space in the magic shop.
-Fixed problems with the Summon Demon (Chaos), Raise Death (Death),
 Phantasmal Servant (Trump), Mindwave, and Adrenaline (Mindcraft)
 spells on systems without mathematical coprocessor.
-Chaos Warriors are no longer hurt (or killed) by the "strain of
 casting (Mass) Genocide" when the chaos patron casts the Genocide
 spell ("Let me relieve thee of thine oppressors!").

 played now.
-Added new sound-events for buying and selling in stores.
-Added support for Adam Bolt's new tile-graphics, transparency-
 and lighting-effects, MOD-, and S3M-files to the DOS version.

 ZAngband specific monsters are displayed with other tiles or with
 ASCII-characters.
 The special DOS options can be accessed by pressing ! while playing.

        * Your own inscriptions should not be junked if an item becomes cursed

        * Bug? Eldritch horrors seen first via ESP don't blast your sanity?
        * Disintegration balls can explode out-of-bounds?
        * Add oriental melee weapons for monks (nunchaku, bo stick etc.)
        * Smashed potions should also affect the player (if withing range)
        * Perhaps add Silas Dunsmore's cumulative light radius patch

Live and let live, right..?
AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
AAAARRRGGGHHH!!!
Somehow, I have a bad feeling about this...
Strangely, all of a sudden I don't feel so good.
You can see armored women on winged horses coming for you.
Oh well, you can't always win.
I'm too young to die!
I'll be back!
O, untimely death!
Slave, thou hast slain me!
Ouch!  That smarts!
Who knocked?
Did anybody get the number of that truck..?
Ouch.
Et tu, Brute!  Then fall, Caesar!
O!  I die, Horatio...
I told you to be careful with that sword...
This guy's a little crazy...
Ok, ok, I get it:  No more pals.
No more mr. nice guy!
Who turned off the light..?
Join the army, see the world, they said...
Mom told me there'd be days like this...
Rats!
Shall this fellow live?
Help, ho!
What ho!  Help!
What hast thou done?
I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you!
You will *pay* for this!
They say blood will have blood...
Violence is no solution!
Yes?
#&%#&#%*#*&%!!!!!
F***!
No time to make a testament?
Ugh!
Aargh!
Aaagghhh!
I'm melting!
Oof..
Oh!
Did somebody knock?
Later, dude...
CU!
What?  Who?  Me?  Oh, s..t!
...amen!
Eeek!
Aacch!
I hate it when that happens.
One direct hit can ruin your whole day.
Oh no!
Not me!
Ouch.
Oh no, not again.
Another one bites the dust.
Goodbye.
Help me!
Farewell, cruel world.
Oh man!
Doough!
This is the End, my only friend.
It's all over.
The fat lady sang.
Why does everything happen to me?
I'm going down.
Crapola.
Pow!
Bif!
Bam!
Zonk!
I should've listened to my mother...
No... a Bud light!
What was that noise?
Mama said there'd be days like this.
It's just one of those days...
I see a bright light...
Mommy?  Is that you?
I let you hit me!
Sucker shot!
I didn't want to live anyway.
-<sob>-
Hah haa!  Missed me!  Ha---
Was that as close as I think it was?
The monsters rejoice:  the hero has been defeated.
It wasn't just a job it was an adventure!
I didn't like violence anyway!
I thought you liked me?
Such senseless violence!  I don't understand it.
I think this guy's a little crazy.
Somehow I don't feel like killing anymore.
Help me! I am undone!
Hey!  Killin' ain't cool.
This fell sergeant, Death, is strict in his arrest...
The rest is silence.
Guh!
It's game over, man!
You've run out of life.
Thou art slain.
Finish him!
Trust me, I know what I'm doing...
Die, mortal!
Kill men i' the dark!  What be these bloody thieves?
Ho!  Murder!  Murder!
O!  I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
O murderous slave!  O villain!
O, falsely, falsely murder'd!
A guiltless death I die.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
Trust me.
Dammit, this thing won't die!
He hit me for HOW MUCH?????
Look, behind you!!!
Who fed steroids to that kobold?
Don't worry, be happy!
I don't believe this!
Oops.
Can't you take a joke?
Well, I didn't much like this character, anyway...
Oops, sorry... didn't mean to disturb you.
I never get to have any fun!
Stop!
Cut it out!
Don't worry.  I've got a plan.
It didn't look so tough.
Run away!
All clear, guys.
AGAIN!?!?!
I don't like this dungeon...
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
My God will protect me.
You wouldn't dare!
But what about my Parry Skill?  Tumbling?
Don't worry - I have Pilot-7.
And I've *never* done you any harm.
I don't understand.  It should be dead by now.
I'm heir to the crown.  They wouldn't dare!
Hey!  Where's my stomach?  My hands?
Ha!  That's the oldest trick in the book.
Cover me.
Watch this.
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
I will not yield.
...but like a man he died.
If you cut me down, I will only become more powerful.
Well, at least I tried...?
What could possibly have gone wrong?
You die...
What's with that weirdo with the teeth?
Surrender?  Never!
I'm sure reinforcements will get here on time.  They promised.
Funny, didn't *look* like a cyberpsycho....
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Do something, SCHMUCK!
I feel I could cast 'Speak with Dead' and talk to myself.
Oh, that's just a light wound.
Ach, is doch nur 'ne Fleischwunde...
I thought you were on MY side...
Next time, try talking!
Oh shit... I'll try to teleport again.
Somebody get me a Rod of Resurrection... QUICK!
Uhh... oh-oh...
Gee, where'd everybody go?
I see it coming...aaargllhhhh!  {sough}
What do you mean 'aaargllhhhh'?  Hey man, I've paid for this.
Ay!  Ay!  Ay!
Ohe!  Ohe!  Ohe!
Et tu, Caesar!  Then fall, Brute!
Even the best laid plans...
Hey, not too rough!
The Random Number Generator hates me!
So when I die, the first thing I will see in heaven is a score list?
Can't we talk this thing over?
Wait!  Spare me and I'll make you rich!  Money is not a problem!
I hate you!
By the kind gods, 'twas most ignobly done!
Mein Leben!
Meine Lieder!
I'm the hero of this story!  I CAN'T die!
I thought heroes were supposed to win!
Gee... thanks.
You've fallen and can't get up!
911?
Sure don't look good...
Oh No!  Here I blow again!
Hey - I've got lawyers.
Thanks, I needed that.
I AM toast!!
Scheisse!

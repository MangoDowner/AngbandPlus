Greetings my friends and welcome to the world of mindless dribble.
This source code will enable you to spend countless hours staring
at your computer when you should be doing something more productive,
anything more productive.

To install this borg, you will need to do the following:
1.  Modify the config.h to uncomment:
        a. the allow_borg line
        b. the score_borg line
        c. the allow_borg_graphics line
2.  Modify the makefile to include the borg1.o (or borg1.obj if windows)
    though borg9.o
3.  Make sure the file borg.txt is located in the \lib\user\ directory.
4.  Modify your borg.txt file if you want to run the borg in a particular
    fashion, including continuous play borgs.
5.  Compile
6.  Start the game, load up a character or make new one.
7.  Hit control z, read and ignore the messages, hit z again.
8.  Grab some popcorn and a soda, and watch your mind go numb.

The borg may get stuck in certain situations.  He may have a Clock Overflow.
He may loop buying and selling the same stuff over and over.  Believe me
when I say that these have been addressed.  His loops are greatly reduced.


Continuous Play Mode: (option)
Upon the death of a borg, he will automatically reroll a random character,
with a random name and start fresh from clevel 1.  To enable the Continuous
Play Mode, turn the game option cheat_live on.  To do that enter the
options by pressing the equal sign (=) then Cheat Options (6).

If you want, you can tell the borg to select a certain race and or class for
the next one rolled up.  You can make these selections from the borg.txt file.

The Continual Play Mode is NOT turned on by default, you will need to
select it.

This borg is updated just about everyday.  You can get the lastest source
as well as executables at http://itctel.com/~apwhite/andrew.html

Have Fun,
Dr. Andrew White

PosBand TODO list:

 - Implement all monster races, make all monsters available for
   possession -- well, you know that.
 - Make the starting inventory race-specific
 - Visually mark pets. Possibly with background color, but this would be
   very hard to implement
 - Fix the "breeder problem" in more smart way
 - Riding, mimicry...
 - Fix big vaults. Clean up OAngband vaults. Add more vaults.
 - Races for next release: Beholder, Crystal Dragon, Golem

===== PosBand installation =====

Last updated for: PosBand 0.9.9 Alpha 1

PosBand is distributed both as source code and as precompiled binaries. Unless
you plan to hack on PosBand, or want to play PosBand on an unusual platform,
you probably should use the binaries.


===== Binary packages =====

Binary packages are currently available for:

 * Windows
 * Linux (Slackware and Red Hat)
 * Mac OS X

--> Windows

Download the file "posband-x.y.z-win.zip". Unzip it with your favorite archive
tool, such as WinZip or WinRAR. Double-click "posband.exe" to play.

Windows binary is built with Cygwin gcc 2.95 compiler.

===== Installing from source =====

Only installing on Unix is covered here.  Makefiles for other systems are
not provided (they would need major changes).  Fixes are welcome; you can
take the old versions from 0.3.0-alpha2.

To install PosBand from source:

 * Download the file "posband-x.y.z.tar.bz2".
 
 * Unpack it:

	tar -xjvf posband-x.y.z.tar.bz2
	cd posband-x.y.z

 * Run the "configure" script.  Useful options are:

	--prefix=<path>		Install PosBand to the given location.
				Default is "/usr/local".
 	--with-xxx		Enable display module xxx. See FRONTEND.txt
				for information on all display modules.
				Default: "win" on Windows, "gcu" and "xaw"
				on others
	--enable-debug		Debug build.  Disables signal catching
				to allow core dumps to be generated, and
				defaults data directory location to
				"./lib".

 * Type "make" to compile PosBand.

 * Type "make install" as root to install PosBand.

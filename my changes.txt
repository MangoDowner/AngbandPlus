---------

- Fixed a memory leak when redefining file paths.
- Added missing sound names to angband_sound_name.

- Added missing time breath to breath_to_attr table.
- Added some speedup code to main-gcu.c that someone posted some time ago.
- Added memory cleanup on exit to main-gcu.c.
- Tweaked stat tables to get bigger stat effects at ranges 6-18 to avoid

To give a count to a command, type a '#', followed by the digits. A count
of 0 defaults to a count of 99. Counts only work with some commands, and
will be terminated by the same things that end a rest or a run. In
particular, typing any character during the execution of a counted command
will terminate the command. To count a movement command, hit space after
the number, and you will be prompted for the command, which may be a digit.

Counted searches or tunnels will terminate on success, or if you are
attacked. A count with control-P will specify the number of previous messages.

Control-R will redraw the screen whenever it is input, not only at command
level. Control commands may be entered with a single key stroke, or with two
key strokes by typing ^ and then a letter.

Type ESCAPE to abort the look command at any point.

Some commands will prompt for a spell, or an inventory item. Selection is
by an alphabetic character - entering a capital causes a desription to be
printed, and the selection may be aborted.

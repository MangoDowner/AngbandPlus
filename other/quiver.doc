====Updated Quiver FAQ/Info sheet  Th 11-18-93 version================
:INTRODUCTION:

The quiver would allow missle ammo (ie. shots, arrows, bolts, etc.) to
be stored in the equiptment list for more convenient (f)iring/(t)hrowing
using a separate fire_from_quiver command.

Please consider that IMHO the addition of a quiver is not an unbalancing
addition, because it is more of a convenience than a new ability like
targetting or recharging rods.  I would compare it with the running code
which speeds play, but does not give any extra power to a character.

I have decided to go with (s)hoot from quiver and (I)nvestigate for the 
time being, since I like that (s)hooting requires only one key and the 
change of (s)earch a turn to (I)nvestigate a turn seems worth this cost. 

:GENERAL INFO:

Q: If you steal a slot what is the point of having a separate quiver at
all??
A: Any missile ammo can be stored in the quiver, at the expense of a slot,
making it available to a separate fire_from_quiver command.  The usefulness
of this is that you can target a monster, then blast him with one command,
There is no need to type '*' to make sure your using ammo rather than 
treasure and you don't even have to specify the slot to use.  Compare these
command strings: "t*v<dir>" or "tv<dir>" versus "s<dir>".  If you have
and use targetting you can even skip specifying a direction.  This makes
using the missle weapons as easy as easy as using mage/priest bolt spells
and prevents the accidental loss of artifacts/valuables.  This may not
seem like much, but my experience is that many people consider using 
missle weapons to be too much fuss and too potentially dangerous (it only
takes one mistyped key to throw something valuable/necessary by mistake
even for the careful player).

Q: So all of this actually works?!
A: Some more testing is needed, but, at the expense of some coding ugliness
(something otherwise lacking in UMoria/Anband ;) ), all of this works just
fine.
[a bit of the coding ugliness has been fixed -DGK]

:GENERAL NOTES:

The quiver unloads itself when emptied so all you need to do is load, aim,
fire.  You simply (w)ield/wear missle ammos to load the quiver, then fire
with the fire_from_quiver command (CRTL-S for now), or unload with a (t)ake
off or (T)ake off command.  You can, of course, (d)rop missle ammo from 
the quiver straight to the dungeon floor.

Differences from the PMoria quiver:
1) You can pick-up ammo that has missed target and it will stack with that
already in the quiver.  This was a _major_ ommission of PMoria IMHO.
2) FAngband has the Morgul targetting code!  This means that for the first 
time you can potentially pump a monster with missle ammo with one keystroke!!
3) The quiver is added at the top of the equipment list rather than the
bottom.

Note, however, that to simplify coding a scroll of Enchant Weapon or
*Enchant Weapon* enchants whatever is being wielded if something is being
wielded or whatever is in the quiver otherwise.  Be sure to unwield your 
weapon _before_ reading the enchant scroll if you want the _ammo_ enchanted.  
I have chosen this arrangement so missle ammo can still be improved by 
enchantment.  In non-quiver Angband you can wield missle ammo to enchant it, 
but in FAngband with the quiver missle ammo always goes in the quiver when 
you (w)ield/wear it.  I figured missle weapons are much less useful if you 
cannot better the ammo you find.

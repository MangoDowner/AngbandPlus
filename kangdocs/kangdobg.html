<DT>Bug Fixes as of Kangband282f &amp; Kangband 282g</DT>
<DD>- Some priest spells would activate as two spells. Fixed with break statements.</DD><DIR>

<DT>- Rogues were not using illusion books correctly - has been fixed.</DT>
<DD>- In-Between game modified again to prevent auto-winning.</DD>
<DT>- Could get a duplicate of weapon in weaponsmaster if escaped out - has been fixed.</DT>
<DD>- Deep water gave too many messages when you could not cross - fixed.</DD>
<DT>- Could not get experience when kill something with a spell - definitely fixed.</DT></DIR>

<DT>Bug Fixes as of Kangband282e</DT>
<DD>- Weaponsmaster was not calculating strike damage correctly - was WAY understated. This has been fixed and slay/elemental properties has been included.</DD>
<DD>- Artifacts could be seen more than once due to quest levels. This has been fixed.</DD>
<DD>- Uniques could appear in dungeon and thereby not in a quest if designed that way - this has been fixed.</DD><DIR>

<DT>- Inbetween game still not giving correct amount - should be payoff of 4 (3 more than you paid) - this has been fixed.</DT>
<DD>- Not a bug but the abuse of quest levels has been fixed. You could go in a quest, get all the treasure, kill all but one creature, leave, and then do it again. Now, Kangband keeps track of who is killed and what is taken. If you grab treasure or kill a monster on any trip to a quest, there won't be treasure the next time. Also, if you kill two rogues out of three, leave, and then come back - there will only be one left.</DD></DIR>

<DD>Bug Fixes as of Kangband282c</DD>
<DD>- Could not exit arena after winning fight. This has been fixed.</DD>
<DD>Bug Fixes as of Kangband281 and earlier</DD>
<DD>- Problem in Kang281a where gambling house would mess up your gold depending on size of wager. This has been fixed.</DD>
<DD>- Problem in Kang281a and Kang282b where you would sometimes end up trapped in a wall after exiting a level or the arena. This has been fixed.</DD>
<DD>- Problem in Kang281a and Kang282b where the gambling hall game "In-between" was rigged in favor of player. This has been tweaked so it is more in line with traditional gambling - i.e. you may win but you will lose more often unless very lucky.</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>- The quest depth would affect the word of recall depth - this has been fixed.</DD>

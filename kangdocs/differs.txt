This file has been updated for Kangband 282c

This variant of Angband is based on the Unix version 2.8.2.  This files lists
all changes in the play between that version and this variant.  In other
words, only inherent changes not major additions.

- "G" does not learn spells anymore.  Must instead visit the tower or temple
  in order to be taught spells.

- Savefiles are not compatible with other versions of angband since new
  character flags were needed for town level.  Savefiles are also not compatible
  with Kangband 281 or Kangband 282a since quests changed the file significantly.
  Savefiles ARE compatible with Kangband 282b.

- Ghosts only appear on the town level when it is night.  Therefore, when 
  running into a tough ghost - make for the inn!  (But, ghosts are no 
  longer being implmented in standard 281 or 282.)

- mages and illusionists can only wield daggers & quarterstaffs comfortably.
  This is similar to the priest restriction on sharp weapons.

- Can't enter house until awarded by Lord.  Must greet him when you are
  of a sufficient level of experience.

- Trees may appear on early levels and can be chopped down via
  the tunnel/dig command.  They can also be chopped down in the
  wilderness.

- both shallow and deep water will appear in the dungeons.  Shallow
  water can simply be walked over.  The player can swim in deep 
  water provided they are not carrying too much weight.

- shallow lava appears which can be crossed if the player has fire resistance.
  deep lava cannot be crossed at all - think of deep lava as a permanent boundary
  that cannot be crossed by player but can be seen over, teleported over, 
  certain fire immune monsters can cross, etc.

- you can request quests from the castle which may require you to kill certain
  monsters or may require exploring a special quest levels.  The special quest
  levels will appear in the wilderness as yellow ">" characters.

- There is a new command - Ctrl-Q which will display the status of your
  quest.

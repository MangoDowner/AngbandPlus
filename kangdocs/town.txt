This file has been updated to Kangband 282c

The town level has undergone a facelift and is the most radical change
in this version of Angband.  The goal was to make the town more interesting
without changing the goal of the game nor the nature of play.  To do that,
many extra buildings were added, some for fun, and some that can help the
character.

The map of the town is as follows (reduced to fit on page)

--------------
| A  B  C  D |   The capital letters are new buildings while the lower case
| f  g  h  i |   letters indicate stores familiar in previous versions of
| j  k  l  m |   Angband.
| N    O   Q |
--------------

A - Library			B - Order of Paladins	C - Castle
D - Fighter's Hall	A - Ranger's Tavern	f - General Store
g - Armory			h - Weaponsmith		i - Inner Temple/store
j - Alchemist		k - Black market		l - Home
m - Magic shop		N - Tower of Sorcery	Q - House of Thieves
O - Arena			Q - Gambling House	N - Tower of Illusion
f - Inn

The map takes up three screens vertically - so the town level no longer fits
nicely on one screen. Also, the stores are randomized but built to look
the same and create a bazaar feeling.

The buildings: Special Buildings

Library - can research weapons & armor to discover the abilities (for a
price)  Can also see a list of the greatest characters of each race.  Town 
history is a little on-line help for the town. 

Castle - can give rewards (at this time - upon reaching level 5, get
the house - the rest of the rewards are gifts).  The busts
are those of the highest Kings (winners). Can also request a quest.

Arena - read poster to see next opponent.  Enter the arena to do battle and 
check the rules so you don't get suprised.  Also, plaque of arena victors.

Gambling House - Play games for gold and check the rules if unsure.

Inn - Listen for rumors (not implemented), rest for the night (to avoid ghosts 
and restock stores), and get food & drink while there.

=====================

The buildings: Class-specific Buildings

Fighters Hall - Greets give rewards.  The plaque is the greatest fighters. 
Armor and weapons can be repaired within reason.  Monster info (same as lib) is 
not implemented yet.

Tower of Sorcery - Greets give rewards and spires of greatest wizards.  Can 
recharge items, identify all possessions and learn spells (instead of 'G'
command).

Temple - Greets give rewards and busts of greatest priests.  Can restore stats,
get completely healed and pray for spells when experienced (replaces the 'G'
command)

House of Thieves - Greets give rewards and wall of greatest thieves.  Can get 
share of stolen gold and identify all possessions.  Also, free rooms at night.

Rangers Tavern - Greets give rewards and plaque is highest rangers.  Bows can be
enhanced as well as arrows.  Weapons can be researched.

Order of Paladins - only paladins can enter this building.  Can repair armor
(within reason) and can request healing.  Greetings give rewards based on
experience (every 10 levels).  The plaque lists greatest paladins.

Tower of Illusion - Greets give rewards and spires of greatest illusionists. 
Can recharge items, identify all possessions and learn spells (instead of 'G'
command).

=====================

Greeting the heads of the orders will either give rewards or allow characters
to choose options.  These rewards occur at levels 10,20,30,40 and 50 for the
class buildings and at 5,10,15,20,25 for the castle.

The Lord of the castle can grant quest providing you are experienced enough.
The quests can be of the simple type (kill 1 or more of monster xxxx) or
complex (clear out a special level in the wilderness).  At the end of each
quest, returning to the lord will net a reward.  Hitting Crtl-Q will give you 
the status of your quest.

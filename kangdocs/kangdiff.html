<B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=7><P>How does Kangband Differ?</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><P>This file has been updated for Kangband 282d</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This variant of Angband is based on the Unix version 2.8.2. This files lists all changes in the play between that version and this variant. In other words, only inherent changes not major additions.</P>
<P>- "G" does not learn spells anymore. Must instead visit the tower or temple in order to be taught spells.</P>
<P>- Savefiles are not compatible with other versions of angband since new character flags were needed for town level. Savefiles are also not compatible with Kangband 281 or Kangband 282a since quests changed the file significantly. Savefiles are not compatible with any Kangband prior to 282d as MANY changes were made to accomodate the new spell structure, quests, etc.</P>
<P>- Ghosts only appear on the town level when it is night. Therefore, when running into a tough ghost - make for the inn! (But, ghosts are no longer being implmented in standard 281 or 282.) The inn can be used to rest at night, thereby restocking shops.</P>
<P>- Two new classes have been added; the illusionist and the druid. They are variations of mages and priests, respectively.</P>
<P>- A new race, kobold, has been added. They are resistant to poison.</P>
<P>- mages and illusionists can only wield daggers, main gauche, &amp; quarterstaffs comfortably. This is similar to the priest restriction on sharp weapons.</P>
<P>- Can't enter house until awarded by Lord. Must greet him when you are of a sufficient level of experience.</P>
<P>- Trees may appear on early levels and can be chopped down via the tunnel/dig command. They can also be chopped down in the wilderness.</P>
<P>- both shallow and deep water will appear in the dungeons. Shallow water can simply be walked over. The player can swim in deep water provided they are not carrying too much weight.</P>
<P>- shallow lava appears which can be crossed if the player has fire resistance. deep lava cannot be crossed at all - think of deep lava as a permanent boundary that cannot be crossed by player but can be seen over, teleported over, certain fire immune monsters can cross, etc.</P>
<P>- Levitation will allow you to cross all terrains except that you must also be resistant to fire to cross lava.</P>
<P>- you can request quests from the castle which may require you to kill certain monsters or may require exploring a special quest levels. The special quest levels will appear in the wilderness as yellow "&gt;" characters.</P>
<P>- There is a new command - Ctrl-Q which will display the status of your quest.</P><DIR>

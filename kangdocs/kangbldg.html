<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This file has been updated to Kangband 282c</P>
<P>The town level has undergone a facelift and is the most radical change in this version of Angband. The goal was to make the town more interesting without changing the goal of the game nor the nature of play. To do that, many extra buildings were added, some for fun, and some that can help the character.</P>
<P>The map of the town is as follows (reduced to fit on page)</P>
<P>-----------</P>
<P>| A B C D | The capital letters are new buildings while the lower case</P>
<P>| f g h i | letters indicate stores familiar in previous versions of</P>
<P>| j k l m | Angband.</P>
<P>|  N O Q  |</P>
<P>-----------</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A - Library&#9;&#9;&#9;B - Order of Paladins&#9;C - Castle<BR>
D - Fighter's Hall&#9;A - Ranger's Tavern&#9;f - General Store<BR>
g - Armory&#9;&#9;&#9;h - Weaponsmith&#9;&#9;i - Inner Temple/store<BR>
j - Alchemist&#9;&#9;k - Black market&#9;&#9;l - Home<BR>
m - Magic shop&#9;&#9;N - Tower of Sorcery&#9;Q - House of Thieves<BR>
O - Arena&#9;&#9;&#9;Q - Gambling House&#9;N - Tower of Illusion<BR>
f - Inn&#9;&#9;&#9;A - Druid's Grove</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The map takes up three screens vertically - so the town level no longer fits nicely on one screen. Also, the stores are randomized but built to look the same and create a bazaar feeling.</P>
<P>The buildings: Special Buildings</P>
<P>Library - can research weapons &amp; armor to discover the abilities (for a price) Can also see a list of the greatest characters of each race. Town history is a little on-line help for the town. </P>
<P>Castle - can give rewards (at this time - upon reaching level 5, get the house - the rest of the rewards are gifts). The busts are those of the highest Kings (winners). Can also request a quest.</P>
<P>Arena - read poster to see next opponent. Enter the arena to do battle and check the rules so you don't get suprised. Also, plaque of arena victors.</P>
<P>Gambling House - Play games for gold and check the rules if unsure.</P>
<P>Inn - Listen for rumors (not implemented), rest for the night (to avoid ghosts and restock stores), and get food &amp; drink while there.</P>
<P>====================</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The buildings: Class-specific Buildings</P>
<P>Fighters Hall - Greets give rewards. The plaque is the greatest fighters. Armor and weapons can be repaired within reason. Monster info (same as lib) is not implemented yet.</P>
<P>Tower of Sorcery - Greets give rewards and spires of greatest wizards. Can recharge items, identify all possessions and learn spells (instead of 'G' command).</P>
<P>Temple - Greets give rewards and busts of greatest priests. Can restore stats, get completely healed and pray for spells when experienced (replaces the 'G' command)</P>
<P>House of Thieves - Greets give rewards and wall of greatest thieves. Can get share of stolen gold and identify all possessions. Also, free rooms at night. This building is part of the gambling house and can only be seen by thieves.</P>
<P>Rangers Tavern - Greets give rewards and plaque is highest rangers. Bows can be enhanced as well as arrows. Weapons can be researched.</P>
<P>Order of Paladins - only paladins can enter this building. Can repair armor (within reason) and can request healing. Greetings give rewards based on experience (every 10 levels). The plaque lists greatest paladins.</P>
<P>Tower of Illusion - Greets give rewards and spires of greatest illusionists. Can recharge items, identify all possessions and learn spells (instead of 'G' command).</P>
<P>Grove of the Druids - Greets give rewards and busts of greatest priests. Can restore stats, get completely healed and pray for spells when experienced (replaces the 'G' command). This building is in the forrested area in the northwest corner of the town. It can only be seen by druids.</P>
<P>=====================</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Greeting the heads of the orders will either give rewards or allow characters to choose options. These rewards occur at levels 10,20,30,40 and 50 for the class buildings and at 5,10,15,20,25 for the castle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Lord of the castle can grant quest providing you are experienced enough. The quests can be of the simple type (kill 1 or more of monster xxxx) or complex (clear out a special level in the wilderness). At the end of each quest, returning to the lord will net a reward. Hitting Crtl-Q will give you the status of your quest.</P>

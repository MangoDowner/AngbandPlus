<DD>Kangband is a variant of Angband 2.8.2 The major claim to fame is the expanded town area. Now the player can visit the castle, library, gambling house, their class-specific building (tower of sorcery, order of paladins, etc.) I have also added the illusionist class, &amp; some additions from GW-Angband. Includes a nice structure for quests.</DD>

<DD>Kangband 2.8.2g fixed more bugs.</DD>
<DD>Kangband 2.8.2f fixed various bugs in 2.8.2e.</DD>
<DD>Kangband 2.8.2e was released which contains the new plot structure, magic spells, druid class, and additional monsters, vaults, etc.</DD>
<DD>Kangband 2.8.2d is currently in development.</DD>
<DD>New to 2.8.2d from the last version of 2.8.2c</DD>
<DD>The plots have been created in structure where a character receives a random number at birth. This number determines which wilderness file and corresponding quests that character will use.</DD>
<DD>Added the artifacts from Jurriaan's Ang/64 which fit into the Tolkien theme. These are The Beaked Axe of Hurin, The Spear of Melkor, The Main Gauche of Azaghal, and the Black Axe of Gothmog.</DD>
<DD>Added the terrains of fog, dirt, and chasm. Not yet fully implemented.</DD>
<DD>Old savefiles no longer work. Sorry. But, on the bright side, I saved space on the executable, removed load1.c, consolidated into just a load.c and a save.c. The reason the files are not compatible is due to the extensive work on the new spell set. I believe it is worth it - hopefully everyone else will too.</DD>
<DD>Artifacts and uniques will no longer appear in quest level if already seen/killed.</DD>
<DD>The druid class was added.</DD>
<DD>The spells for the four magic classes were completely revamped. The html files, <A HREF="kangdosp.html">old spells</A> &amp; <A HREF="kangdos2.html">new spells</A> details the changes. This was a huge undertaking and hopefully I make these characters more powerful in magic (earlier versions reduced combat skills) without losing the balance of the game. New spells, new effects, increasing power with single spells based on level, removed redundant spells, more spells.</DD>
<DD>Bug of not being able to leave arena fixed.</DD>
<DD>Miscellaneous bugs fixed.</DD>
</DL>
<P><IMG SRC="Image5.gif" WIDTH=536 HEIGHT=5></P>
<DL>
<DD>New to 2.8.2c from the last version of 2.8.2b</DD>
<DD>Added vaults from Zangband.</DD>
<DD>Fixed bugs (see bugs.txt included in the kangdocs directory)</DD>
<DD>Quests are now user-defineable! I have included a document that describes how to create them.</DD>
<DD>There are two new "buildings" - a weaponsmaster and beastmaster.</DD>
<DD>If the character does well, can visit all other buildings (except for that hidden thieves lair)</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DD>New to 2.8.2b from the last version of 2.8.1a. The first new addition is the obvious use of the 2.8.2 source code. Secondly, a wilderness has been build outside the expanded town. The stairs to the dungeon are in the wilderness. The mage can now handle the dagger or quarterstaff without being encumbered. There are terrains of trees, mountains, water, and lava in the game. Most importantly, the QUESTS are now implemented with the castle building.</DD>
<DD>This particular zip file is the source code. Kangband should compile on other systems just as easy as Angband 2.8.1 did. I did not make any changes that would (I think) affect compiling.</DD>
<DD>This source code is also set by default to compile for DOS. Copy over the correct makefile, verify config.h, </DD>
<DD>h-config.h, h-system.h, etc.</DD>
<DD>Please direct feedback, comment, complaints, compliments, etc. to wigle@fmmail.uc.edu</DD>
<DD>Thank you and I hope you enjoy this addition. All help on this variant can be found in the "kangdocs" directory.</DD>

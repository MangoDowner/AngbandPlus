<P>There are additional terrain features that Kangband has implemented over standard Angband. They are described as follows along with any important notes:</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#00ff00"><P>#</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"> - Trees. These green characters can be chopped down (with the tunnel command). They cannot be seen through. Monsters that can pass through walls can also pass through trees. They appear on the town level and once in a while on the first two dungeon levels.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#00ffff"><P>#</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"> - Shallow Water. This can appear in the dungeon as a cosmetic touch. It has no bearing on eithe rplayer or monster movement.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#000080"><P>#</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"> - Deep Water. This can be crossed by the player if they are not burdened with too much weight. This as well as shallow water can be seen over. Players that are burdened so they can't cross may be prone to monster spell attacks. Only monsters that can swim, fly, or pass through walls (ghosts) can cross deep water.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>#</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"> - Shallow Lava. This can only be crossed by the player if they are resistant to fire or they can levitate. It can be seen over and only monsters that have fire resistance, can fly, or pass through walls can cross.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#800000"><P>#</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"> - Deep Lava. This cannot be crossed unless the player is levitating. Only certain monster defined as being able to cross (in addition to flying and passing through walls) are able. Ex: fire elemental.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#808080"><P>#</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"> - Fog. This hinders everyones view and monsters can be seen only when they are next to the player, excepting infravision, artifacts, etc.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#808000"><P>^</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"> - Mountain. A permanent feature of the wilderness that cannot be crossed, period.</P>

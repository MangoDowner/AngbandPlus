</B></FONT><DL>
<DD>People who (unknowingly or knowingly) contributed to Kangband:</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>Greg Wooledge - I borrowed some of Greg's ideas from GW-Angband and want to give proper aknowledgement. The following were taken from his source and added to Kangband: kobold race, poison and venom attributes for weapons, critical hits for rogues when monster asleep, monsters are not helpless when stunned, monster saving throw function, rod sorting hack, arrows/bolts good unless damaged, enchant weapon only goes to natural damage ammount, high level warriors fear resistance, customized monster health bar (I love this change!), </DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Greg eliminated Globe of Invulnerability from his variant and reduce the blows table for mages. I went for a slightly different way of balancing the mage class. I kept GOI but imposed a penalty if they wield anything other than a dagger. I felt this was more fair to the mage and matched the priest penalty (though more severe) for a non-class weapon.</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>I also did not use his spell rewrite (Greg did a good job and I like it but I was trying for a Angband 3.0 generation and did not want what I thought was a little too radical of a change). I have changed my mind since then - am rewriting spells now.</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>I tried to document in the code every case where Greg's code was used.</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Ben Harrison - Obviously, the variant would not exist if Ben had not kept Angband development. Thanks for all your work and effort into this most amazing game.</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Heino Vander Sanden - For the idea of implementing quests in Angband.</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Glenn Vanzanden - for the code and idea of using the v_info.txt file to create special levels which I then interpreted as quest levels.</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Topi Ylinen - for his wonderful Zangband variant. Have borrowed some ideas and vaults from his that fit into my overall scheme. Even though I am not using a lot of his features - they are still pretty cool. Anyone who hasn't tried Zangband should at least go through one game.</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Julian Lighton for Sangband - his variant gave me ideas and methods for revising the spell system (as did other places as well). Of particular help were ideas for the druid and illusionist.</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Ivan Tkatchev for making a father proud. (-:  He has formed a new variant, Kamband, from the Kangband 282c source.  It is always nice to see an idea grow.</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>Debuggers and idea makers from the net: Mark Howson, Joseph Dixon, Dave Howdan, Peter Knutsen, Darren, Mischa, Kevin Donnelly, Eric Nastav, Arcum Dagsson, David Lerman, Lyman Green, Ryan Redekopp, and many others. Sorry if I miss someone by name. I mention these people as they have helped track down the source of a bug, provided ideas I used, or in general gave me a lot of feedback.</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>Special Note of thanks to one enthusiastic kangband player: Shamona who has praised my simple creation with wild abandon on the newsgroup. (-:</DD>
<DD>===============</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>Thanks to the authors of Omega and ADOM from which I gained ideas. Omega has a large town with class-specific buildings. Both Omega and ADOM have quests.</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>Thanks to all those who compile Kangband for systems other than DOS. I am only able to create the DOS executable - so am very grateful for those who compile to let others play my work.</DD>
<DD>&nbsp;</DD>
<DD>Thanks to Paul Murray for compiling Kangband for 32-bit Windows.</DD>
<DD>Thanks to Mark Howson for compiling Kangband for the Amiga.</DD>
<DD>Thanks to ? for compiling Kangband for the Macintosh.</DD>

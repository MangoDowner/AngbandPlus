</B></FONT><P>A new class has been added to this version of Angband - the Illusionist.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Illusionist is similar to the Magic-user in that they can cast spells from spellbooks. The commands are the same - only the spells and spellbooks have changed. There is some overlapping of spells between the Illusionist and the magic-user/priest. Notice that the illusionist uses spells to trick or confuse monsters and these spells are (hopefully) more important than straight damage. The illusionist does have damaging spells as well but has to work hard to find a spell for teleporting (in one of the special spellbooks)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Think of the illusionist as the second cousin of the mage. By the way, human, half-elves, and elves can become illusionists. The other races do not approve of the class schism. Of course, you could pick one of those combinations, but it would be marked with an "*". (non-standard)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The spellbooks in order of potency are:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Illusions for Beginners</P>
<P>&#9;Tricks and Visions</P>
<P>&#9;Phantasms and Illusions</P>
<P>&#9;Shadows and Prisms</P>
<P>&#9;Serten's Immunities</P>
<P>&#9;Knowledge of Kenault</P>
<P>&#9;Otiluke's Spheres</P>
<P>&#9;Boccob's Book of Shadows</P>
<P>&#9;Bigby's Handbook</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I used the names Boccob, Otiluke, and Bigby out of AD&amp;D, in the same manner as the mage books Tenser..., and Raal... I tried my best to make this class "fit" with the rest of the game in terms of spell balance, and character feel.</P>

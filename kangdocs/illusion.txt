A new class has been added to this version of Angband - the Illusionist.

The Illusionist is similar to the Magic-user in that they can cast spells 
from spellbooks.  The commands are the same - only the spells and spellbooks
have changed.  There is some overlapping of spells between the Illusionist
and the magic-user/priest. Notice that the illusionist uses spells to trick
or confuse monsters and these spells are (hopefully) more important than
straight damage. The illusionist does have damaging spells as well but has
to work hard to find a spell for teleporting (in one of the special spellbooks)

Think of the illusionist as the second cousin of the mage.  By the way,
ONLY HUMANS can become illusionists.  The other races do not approve of the
class schism.  Of course, you could pick one of those combinations, but
it would be marked with an "*".

The spellbooks in order of potency are:

	Illusions for Beginners
	Tricks and Visions
	Phantasms and Illusions
	Shadows and Prisms
	Serten's Immunities
	Knowledge of Kenault
	Otiluke's Spheres
	Boccob's Book of Shadows
	Bigby's Handbook

I used the names Boccob, Otiluke, and Bigby out of AD&D, in the same manner
as the mage books Tenser..., and Raal...  I tried my best to make this class
"fit" with the rest of the game in terms of spell balance, and character
feel.

For a detailed list of the spells, see the Microsoft Word document
"spells.doc".  This show the spells per book for Mage, Priest, and
Illusionist.  It also shows spell damage/duration, breakdown of types
of spells and any other useful information (-:

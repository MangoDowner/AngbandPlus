====== Basic Notes ======

Name:                Sangband  (Skills Angband)
Version:             1.0.0
Date:                March, 2003
Maintainer:          Leon Marrick  (leon2m@sprintmail.com)
Porter:              
Web Site:            http://home.sprintmail.com/~leon2m/sang/
Newsgroup:           rec.games.roguelike.angband

System Requirements: 
     


====== Installation ======

Unzipping:
     The Sangband installation includes this file, a manual, either an 
executable or a source code directory, and a "lib" directory, plus some 
miscellaneous files.  Check to make sure that the following directories are 
present in your "lib" directory:
apex, bones, data, edit, file, help, info, pref, user, xtra
     If any are missing, create them.

Playing:
     Use the executable, choose to start a new character, roll him 
up, and begin play.  The game will display useful help text if you type '?' 
on most screens.

Upgrading:
     Sangband is in active development.  When you see a new version announced, 
or one appears on the web site, you may usually transfer your existing character 
to the new game.
     You make a backup copy of your savefile ("lib/save/yourname"), then copy 
it over to the new version.  If you want to, you can do the same thing with 
your user preference files ("lib/user/yourname.prf" and/or "lib/user/user.prf").
You can also copy your old score file ("lib/apex/scores.raw").
     When satisfied with the new version, you can delete the old one.

Troubleshooting:
     Most players just fire up the game and start having fun.  But you might 
get unlucky.  This section lists problems that players have reported:




Sending suggestions:
     Again, Sangband is in active development; suggestions and reports are 
much appreciated.

Getting help:
     The best place to get tips, hints, information, and suggestions about 
your character is the newsgroup "rec.games.roguelike.angband".

                         For <<your operating system>>

     All system-specific files can be found in /src/system.  If you don't 
see the files you expect, it is probably because Sangband is not yet 
ported to your system.

Sangband is currently ported to IBM, Windows, GCU, X11, and GTK.

     Sangband can be a deep and rich game, or it can be a very shallow one,
depending on the amount of source-diving you do.  The tragedy of the maintainer
is that he can never be truly surprised; he knows the game too well.  You read
the ultimate spoilers at your own risk.


====== Basic Notes ======

Name:                Sangband  (Skills Angband)
Version:             1.0.0
Date:                October, 2005
Maintainer:          Leon Marrick  (sangband@runegold.org)
Porter:              
Web Site:            http://www.runegold.org/sangband
Newsgroup:           rec.games.roguelike.angband

System Requirements: 
     At least a x386 processor, 2 megs memory, 3 megs hard disk space, and 
a monitor capable of displaying 16 colors and about 640x480 resolution. 
    "You can probably run Sangband on your machine."



====== Installation ======

Unzipping:
     The Sangband installation includes this file, a manual, an executable, 
and a "lib" directory, plus some miscellaneous files.  Check to make sure that 
the following directories are present in your "lib" directory:
apex, bones, data, edit, file, help, info, pref, user, xtra


Playing:
     Double-click the executable, choose to start a new character, roll him 
up, and begin play.  The game will display useful help text if you type '?' 
on most screens.


Upgrading:
     Sangband is in active development.  When you see a new version announced, 
or one appears on the web site, you may usually transfer your existing character 
to the new game.
     You make a backup copy of your savefile ("lib/save/yourname"), then copy 
it over to the new version.  If you want to, you can do the same thing with 
your user preference files ("lib/user/yourname.prf" and/or "lib/user/user.prf").
You can also copy your old score file ("lib/apex/scores.raw").
     When satisfied with the new version, you can delete the old one.


Troubleshooting:
     Most players just fire up the game and start having fun.  But you might 
get unlucky.  This section lists problems that players have reported:



Sending suggestions:
     Again, Sangband is in active development; suggestions and reports are 
much appreciated.

Getting help:
     The best place to get tips, hints, information, and suggestions about 
your character is the newsgroup "rec.games.roguelike.angband".

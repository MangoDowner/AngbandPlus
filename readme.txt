=== General Info ===

IF YOU DON'T READ INSTRUCTIONS, AT LEAST READ THE FAQ!

This is the README file for PosBand 0.9.9.

PosBand 0.9.9 is a variant of Angband rogue-like game.  PosBand features
monster races and possessor class for player.  It tries to maintain
the feel of "Vanilla" Angband, but enhances the gameplay by adding
some interesting features.  The most important one is funny races - dragons
like DrAngband, demons like EyAngband, and many others, including hydras,
ogres, wraiths, liches - and most of another monsters of Vanilla Angband.

For [hopefully] complete information on changes, see file 'ChangeLog.txt'.

PosBand 0.1.0 and higher is itself based on NPPAngband source code
base. NPPAngband is a variant, which tries to be 'ideal' Angband - not too
far from original Angband ideas, but including all the new features, such as
quests and new AI code. NPPAngband is developed by Jeff Greene, and is
available at "http://home.comcast.net/~nppangband/".

PosBand works on Windows and UNIX. Support for other systems systems was
dropped in version 0.9.9, but it should be possible to backport the
system-specific front-end from version 0.3.x. Makefile and probably source
hacking will be required.

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

Savefile compatibility is broken in PosBand 0.9.9 due to major changes in
the equipment code. Sorry.

Tiles are supported (somewhat), but not included.  You can get them
at Angband web site, "http://thangorodrim.net".


=== Reporting bugs ===

Report all bugs to <posband@earthsea.org>. Please include 'PosBand' in your
subject line. Don't forget to mention version and OS. Try to include as
much details as you can.


=== License ===

Most of the code uses old Angband/Moria license. All the changes in
Angband >= 2.7.0, NPPAngband and PosBand use GNU General Public License.
See COPYING.txt for details.  Note that it is possible that Angband will
soon be relicensed as GPL.

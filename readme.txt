Craftband 0.2
=============

Craftband is a variant of Angband focused on allowing the player to craft
items.  Currently, it adds a crafting menu to the game, a few crafting recipes, and
some basic crafting components.  Some items can be broken down to extract
crafting components, and these components can be combined to make a small
set of items. Item quality now depends on material quality and vice versa.

Future releases will include more recipes and components, the ability to
customise your created items with enhancements, and the new Artisan class
that gets bonuses across-the-board to crafting.

Please visit the development website, http://craftband.googlecode.com ,
for more info.

Readme file for Cthangband 4.0.0 beta 5th March 2000
====================================================

Thank you for downloading this latest version of Cthangband.

There have been a lot of changes since the last version (3.1.2b), so
many that the savefile format has had to chage (and as such you will not
be able to convert older 3.1.2b savefiles).

The biggest of these changes is the removal of the class/level system
completely and its replacement with a skill system. There are also
changes to magic, in that there are two completely new magic systems
(Hedge magic and Shamanism) and the two existing magic systems have both
been changed.

As none of these systems have been tested for playbalance (except by
me...) I am releasing this as a 'Beta' version.

Don't expect this version to be fully balanced or bugfixed - if it blows
up and takes your savegame with it then let me know what happened but
don't get too upset. It is the price you pay for playing unfinished
code.

In particular, the documentation is only about half finished. I have
made sure that I have done the essential bits for people who are used to
Angband/Cthangband and need to know what has shanged and how the skill
system works. The rest of it (the newbie stuff on how to move around the
dungeon and how to generate characters etc..) I will continue to write
and then I shall release a completed version soon (hopefully
incorporating any bugfixes or playbalance tweaks that are reported back
to me from this beta version.)

Enjoy!

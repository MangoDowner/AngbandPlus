A guide to DrAngband for experienced Angbanders
-----------------------------------------------
v2.9.0
------

Most of the stuff that applied to angband will apply to DrAngband
but a few fundamental concepts are different:

Resistances
-----------

Previously, resistances cut damage to one third regardless of how many of the
same were posessed. Temporary resistances cut the damage to one ninth.
In drangband each instance of a resistance cuts the damage by a half. For
example, a character posessing 2 resistances to fire and a temporary
resistance to fire will have fire damage reduced to 12.5%. Immunities
cut damage to zero as before.
Immunities are shown in the resistances screen as '*' and temporary resistances
as '#'.

Melee Slays
-----------

Slays (eg Slay Orc) and brands are now applied to the entire melee damage 
rather than just the base dice rolls. They have been reduced from a maximum
of three to max 2. This does not apply to ammo, which has slays of the
same power as normal and applied the normal way.

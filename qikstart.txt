A guide to DrAngband for experienced Angbanders
-----------------------------------------------
Loading pre-2.9.2 savefiles:
----------------------------
Savefiles from versions of DrAngband prior to Drangband 2.9.2
should load fine, with only the follwing small problems:

* Some terrain types will be changed on the current map. Simply
  leave the level and the next level will be generated correctly.


v2.9.1
------

Most of the stuff that applied to angband will apply to DrAngband
but a few fundamental concepts are different:

Big Screen Mode
---------------

If your port supports this (and only the dos and OS/2 ones certainly
do), activate 50-line mode by starting up drangband with:

angband -b

or

angband -b50

Other screen sizes between 25 and 50 (and ever higher) are also
possible.

Resistances
-----------

Previously, resistances cut damage to one third regardless of how many of the
same were posessed. Temporary resistances cut the damage to one ninth.
In drangband each instance of a resistance cuts the damage by a half. For
example, a character posessing 2 resistances to fire and a temporary
resistance to fire will have fire damage reduced to 12.5%. Immunities
cut damage to zero as before.
Immunities are shown in the resistances screen as '*' and temporary resistances
as '#'.
Invisibility is shown as '*' in the INVIS field, and see invisible is shown
as '+'.

Melee Slays
-----------

Slays (eg Slay Orc) and brands are now applied to the entire melee damage 
rather than just the base dice rolls. They have been reduced from a maximum
of three to max 2. This does not apply to ammo, which has slays of the
same power as normal and applied the normal way.

Dragons & Equipment
-------------------

Dragons can only wear:
1 Cloak
1 Crown (no helms)
1 Amulet
1 Lightsource
6 Rings

They only fight with their teeth and claws and cannot use melee weapons or bows.


Weapon Skills
-------------

Weapons skills are now divided into different weapon classes:

Stabbing: Daggers, main gauches, short and small swords.
Swords:   Other swords.
Polearms: Axes, lances, etc.
Hafted:   Maces.

Races have different skills for each of these weapon classes. For example
priests are great with hafted weapons but poor with edged weapons. Hobbits
are good with daggers but poor with the other types. For a complete list
see birth.txt.

Basically, avoid using weapons that both your race and class are bad at
(for example a gnome mage with a polearm).

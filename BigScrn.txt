This version of OAngband supports Tom Morton's bigscreen patch,
which allows you to have a terminal larger than 80x24. To change
the terminal size...

On MS Windows:
Change the NumCols and NumRows entries in the ANGBAND.INI file.
NumCols must be greater or equal to 80. NumRows must be greater 
or equal to 24.

On other platforms:
Pass "-y rows" and "-x cols" options on the command line.

v0.1.0 (Changes from Vanilla v3.0.5)
-------------------------------------
 + Applied all CVS-changes from Vanilla Angband (upto 08/09/2004)
 + Added some monsters from EyAngband
 	- Innocent bystander
 	- Idle workman
 	- Town Bully
 	- Killer Bee
 	- Huge Cockroach
 	- Owlbear
 	- Giant Cockroach
 	- Knight Archers
 	- Creeping Gems
 + Added some objects from EyAngband
 	- Leather Sandals
 	- Wooden Club
 	- Wooden Shield
 	- Elven Cloak
 	- Potion of Satisfy Hunger (in stead of a scroll)
 	- Mushroom of Restore Dexterity
 	- Amulet of Intelligence
 + The "Study"-flag now tells you how many spells you can learn (taken from 
	EyAngband by Eytan Zweig)
 + Removed unused "flags"
 	- CHAR_MULTI
 	- FRIEND
 	- HURT_FIRE
 	- HURT_COLD
 	- BO_POIS
 + Adds artifact memory. If you *identify* an artifact in one game, all 
	subsequent games from the same savefile will know the artifact's abilities 
	(unless randarts are used). ("Artifact Memory patch" by Eytan Zweig)
 + Changed dungeon generation so that vaults may be flipped on the x and y 
	axises, allowing  greater variation in dungeon appearance.  ("Vault Flipping 
	patch" by Eytan Zweig)
 + Changed the way the level feeling delay is calculated, so time in the town 
	has no effect  on it. In other words, if you go down to the dungeon, spend 
	some time in there, go back to the town, and return to the dungeon, the 
	appearance of the level feeling will depend on the last level you were in in 
	the dungeon, and not on the town. ("Levels Feeling patch" by Eytan Zweig)
 + Changed the way level feelings are affected by pits to be dependant on the 
	type of pit/nest and the depth. ("Monster Pit Feelings patch" by 
	Eytan Zweig)
 + The option "Prompt before picking up" altered so it only prompts when the 
	player slows down after picking up an item (based upon "Heavy Prompt Patch" 
	by Eytan Zweig)
 + Allow the player to define what items should be automatically destroyed by 
	the game. Known worthless items (like potions of weakness after you found 
	out what they do) can be destroyed automatically at the time of creation. 
	Items that require identification before you know if they are good or bad 
	like weapons and armor can be destroyed automatically as soon as the player 
	(pseudo-)identifies them. ("Auto-squelch patch" by David T. Blackston)
 + Main screen shows # of experience points left to move to another level 
	instead of current # of experience points (taken from EyAngband 
	by Eytan Zweig)
 + HP and SP both each take only one line (taken from EyAngband by Eytan Zweig)
 + Altered the options to my own flavour
 + Changed the door from "Home" to a door in stead of number 8
 + Re-ordered the monsters and objects
 	- All monsters from the same depth are grouped together
 	- All different types of objects are grouped together with some unused slots 	
		per group to add new objects without breaking savefile compatibility
	- Removed unused object types
 	- Artifact lightsources are now marked as potions ("!" instead of "~"; makes 
		more sense for both the Phial as the Arkenstone)
 + The monsters who have the HAS_LITE flag set from r_info.txt will have a torch 
	radius around them. Currently the monsters who you would expect to have 
	light, do. They include innately lit monsters (light hounds, fire vortex, 
	etc), and monsters who would carry light (human monsters like mages, 
	paladins, priests, etc). Most towns people carry lite. ("Monster Lite patch" 
	by Dr. Andrew White; slighlty modified so it isn't a compile-option any 
	longer)
 + Removed the lua-scripting support

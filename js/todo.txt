  In some traditions, it is he who slithers into the Garden of Eden and seduces Eve, thereby impregnating her with Cain. Sammael is reportedly a handsome,
  redheaded young man and is quite difficult for females to resist. He is said to have a great appreciation for human art and considered to be the first art

  Now he fans the Flames of Damnation. A set of bellows is his symbol.

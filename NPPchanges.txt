Version 0.2.0 

New features:

Added EYAngband-style quests.
Added EYAngband small levels and option to always have small levels
All classes get better chance to hit sleeping monster

Rogues get new abilities (from Oangband):
extra shot with sling at level 26
unusually gifted with slings, better to-hit and to-dam
get additional to-hit and to-dam when throwing well-balanced weapons
unusually higher chance to hit sleeping monster
ability to set traps, set advanced monster traps, and steal items
from monsters. (one trap to begin, and second trap at level 26)
/*warning, failing to steal has some very negative consequences*/

Made the JLE ego items and amulets a little weaker.
Added Leon Marrick's modified help files and re-edited them for NPPAngband.
Added throwing weapons and well balanced weapons.  They are easier to hit with & 
they do extra damage.
Players start with equipment wielded.
Took interactive startup menus from EYAngband.
Added minimum depth for monsters during creation.  Weaker monsters don't appear 
deeper.
Added a new trap (dagger pit).
Players don't use full energy if they use less than max# of attacks
to kill a monster.
Modified the file dump to include a chart of resist flags, stat increases and 
sustains due to equipment.
Added additional player screens which show chart of resist flags, stat
Increases and sustains due to home inventory.
Changed "A" monsters from Angels to "Ainur", and modified a couple other 
monsters.
Adjusted speeds of some monsters to +5, +15, or +25.
Made probing more informative.
Added "Create Monster Trap" scroll.
Rangers only get one extra shot with bow, at level 26.
Warriors get an extra attack at level 26(but a max of 5 from the weapon, for a 
total of 6).
Made "young_dragon" nests more common, humaniod nests deeper, & animal pits 
rarer.
Some nests will occasionally use the highest level monsters
rather than every other monster out of 16 chosen. 
Some pits will occasionally use only the harder half of the 64 chosen monsters. 
Chance of avoiding theft not 100% until dex is 18/180.
Rods may be recharged, with a chance of destroying them.
Messages for temporary resists now factor in the appropriate permanant resist
(ex. a player who is immune to cold will not get message "you feel more
 resistant to cold" when they quaff a potion of resist cold)
Altered parsing routine to allow for uber-flags (ex. resist_all), from 
SCthAngband.
Added some uber-flags (ex...im_elem, no_charm, drop_up_to_14 items)
Staffs now stack like the wands/rods.
The stun counter stops increasing when a player is knocked out, so players 
have a much better chance of avoiding the "knocked out" instadeath.
Adjusted the way chest themes are derived, and made larger chests
have more great items than smaller chests.
Smaller chests are now more common.
Large jeweled chests replace ruined chests, and have more items.
Many Greater Vaults how have chests in them.

three times smaller, and much quicker.

proper amount
	of charges by which the stack is being reduced.

option

Morgoth killed
fixed: The HTML screenshot meta tag indicated an Angband 3.0.3 screen dump. HTML 
file now indicates an NPPAngband screen dump.
fixed: The name of greater vaults wasn't showing up right in the notes file.



Version 0.1.1 (all bugfixes)

fixed: names of killed uniques didn't appear in notes file if player was blind, 
unique was invisible 
	or out of LOS when killed

Version 0.1.0 

*	Added support for describing monsters speed at +5 (somewhat quickly), +15 
(exceedingly quickly), and +25 (extremely quickly). 
*	Added patch to change player's color as their hit-points drop. This is an 
option 
found under "display options". 
*	Increased chance of increased damage dice and to hit dice on weapons, and 
increased changes in increased damage dice on ammunition. 
*	Decreased level boost from dragon scale mail to +10. 
*	Reduced level boost from powerful amulets to +10. 
*	Amulets & spell books are generated as a guaranteed "good" only if out of 
depth. 
*	Added option to go up or down additional flight of stairs some of the time 
(from 
Oangband). 
*	Added "themed chests", similar to Oangband. There are 16 themes, and may 
frequently contain guaranteed good or great objects. 
*	Chests now increase level rating by +5. 
*	Added different templates for "great items" rather than good items. There 
are 
several things in the good list aren't in the great list (such as spellbooks).   
*	Changed the object generation code so that the "great" flag no longer 
needs the 
"good" flag to produce a great item. The "great" flag without the "good" flag 
will 
produce a great item, but it only gets one chance instead of four to become an 
artifact. This was done as a way to keep the new style chests from becoming too 
powerful. 
*	Added Dr. Whites Monster Lite patch. 
*	Added Eytan Zwieg's vault flipping patch. 
*	Added a note taking patch, this is a birth option (birth_take_notes), and 
needs to be 
specified before the character is started. I did a significant re-write of this 
patch. 
Comments can be written to a file, and they will automatically print out in a 
character dump. In addition, it automatically records the turn, level of char, 
and 
dungeon level of certain events, such as: the killing of uniques, finding of 
artifacts, 
and greater vaults created, when a player is killed or wins the game, and every 
time 
the character gains a new level, but only if it is divisible by 5 (level 5, 10, 
15, 20, 
etc…). These notes automatically print out with the character dump. The 
formatting 
on this feature isn't perfect yet, but I plan on finishing it after I 
incorporate 
EYAngband's resistance system. 
*	Added rod-wand-stacking based on Oangband 0.6.0. 
*	Reduced delay when using the autoroller to create a character. Should be 
10 times 
faster. 
*	Added DarkGod's html screen dump patch. 
*	Dropped Items may now be specified by theme. Code is mostly in place to 
create 
themed monster drops. Currently, the themed drops are used in chest opening & 
vault creation (chests w/ monster 40 levels OOD).  
*	Added the autosquelch patch. I made some minor changes to the sub-quality 
squelching menu. For rings and amulets, there are only three levels (none, 
cursed, 
and all but artifact). I also added in the option to automatically squelch 
chests after 
they are opened.
 
*	I deliberately made almost no changes to the edit files, so the first 
version will give 
almost the the exact same playability as Angband v 3.0.3. with some nice options 
that Angband, IMHO, should contain, such as rod/wand stacking, screen dumps 
and autosquelch. The only changes in the edit files are:
*  Added rods re-charge time to the PVAL flag (without this updated file, the 
game WILL crash almost instantly due to divide by zero errors) 
*  Increased the rarity of chests, to compensate for them being loaded with 
so many good & great items 
*  Added the has_lite flag to the appropriate creatures, so the Lite Patch will 
work 
*  Removed the good flag from many of the creatures who have the great 
flag, to balance out all the great items that are now in the chests. Mostly only 
those who got the great flag added in the JLE-patch. 
*  Modified some of the greater vaults so they include chests in certain areas. 
*  Five new types of monster vaults and pits. The ogre pits are a little bland 
right now. I plan on adding more types of Ogres, but I am deliberately 
holding that until the next version of NPP Angband so this one keeps as 
close as possible to 100% Angband 3.0.3 playability. 

*  Six new types of monster vaults and pits. The ogre pits are a little bland 
right 
now. I plan on adding more types of Ogres, but I am deliberately holding that 
until 
the next version of NPP Angband so this one keeps as close as possible to 100% 
Angband 3.0.3 playability. 
*  There is a minimum depth enforcer when selecting the type of Monster Pit or 
Next, so the weaker ones, such as Jelly Pits, don't appear at higher depths.

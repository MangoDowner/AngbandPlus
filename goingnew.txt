--- Version 2.8.3v1, initial release ---

* Applied Tim Baker's Easy Patch 1.1
* Applied Tim Baker's Recall Patch 1.0
* Applied dsb's rod-sorting patch
* Applied James D. Lockwood's "store examine" patch
* Applied David Blackston's damage rating patch
* Applied Keldon Jones's widely-circulated monster AI patch,
  and added a new option to toggle it (which is off by default)
* Greg Wooledge's fear/sleep health bars, plus my own
  for confusion/stun
* Classes now color that '@' that we know and either love or hate
  (this should be made into a "class_chars" option in the future)
* A new item flag, "IGNORE_DISEN" (but nothing uses this yet)
* GoI tweaked a little:
  * monster distance attacks bypass invulnerability
  * attempting to engage in hand-to-hand combat while
    invulnerable just has you switch places with that monster
  * Thus the name Goingband.
* Bronze, Gold, and Shining dragon pits now available
* "Detect doors" detects locked doors now
* Monster inventories are now part of savefiles
* The "Hack -- save/restore memory" in monster1.c is patched
* The 4/6 keys no longer are legal keys in options screens
* The "keymap_dump" bug was fixed in the more straightforward manner
* Character dumps now include (part of) the 'C h' screen,
  which now displays immunities as '*' (idea and some
  code from GJW) if you use the "extend_dump" option
* Stat bonuses with sustains are now displayed correctly in 'C h'
* Resist chaos displays a '*' in resist confusion in 'C h', and "S.Dig"
  was changed to "SlowD"
* No more flavored "Amulet s" (note the space, that's what I got rid of!)
* (from COLORS.DIF) New "spell_colors" option
* The quitting prompts now prompt for SUICIDE (like
  GW-Angband), and, if you quit, your score is registered.
* Auto-haggle is off by default (I like haggling!), and the testing
  options are on by default
* r_info now has a limit of around 575, v_info of 511, options of 128
* Some more monsters in r_info.txt have exceptional drops
* Several other changes in r_info.txt
* Vault changes: three new vaults, info on making vaults, three
  new vault specifiers from Kangband/Kamband (';', 'T', 'D')
* Minor spelling change
* Debug mode and spoilers generation are compiled in
  by default
* Number of turns included in character dump
* Artifacts *can* break (but not as easily as regular objects),
  to allow for the future Seeker Arrow of Bard

TO DO:
* Sleep brand for ammo (!!!)
* Items which actually use IGNORE_DISEN
* Change the maximum number of monster blows to 8
* Make a new monster spell: BA_ICEE (ice storm)
* Also BR_PARA, but GF_OLD_SLEEP should be able to work on
  player before I do this
* Add new town buildings (bookstore, castle, arena, gambling house,
  adventurer's guild, etc.)
* Be able to customize town, spells, races, classes, (!!!) artifact activations
* Add "auto_stair" option that will make stairs go up/down approximately 1d6 levels
* Bug: Recall Patch 1.0 generates multiple artifacts with preserve mode
  (because of this, "remember_recall" is now off by default, but this is
  just a hack until a new version of the Recall Patch comes out)
* Add highscore-summarising features, like "angscore"
* Add lots of things from GW-Angband, Kangband, Kamband (both have
  annoying bugs now), Cthangband, and Zangband
* Add "video recorder" mechanism
* Add Kamband's race characters

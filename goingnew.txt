--- Version 2.8.3v4 ---

* Added monster speech, which was stolen from both Kamband and Zangband;
  to add speech to a monster, give the monster the CAN_SPEAK flag, and
  be sure the third number in the "W:" line matches the numbers in
  "bravnnn.txt" and "fearnnn.txt". Speech kinds 0 and 52 were stolen
  from Zangband, while kinds 4 and 137 were from the built-in
  "moan"/"insult" arrays.
* Turned off auto-pickup, and made it so that if you stay still and
  pick up an object, you do not use up a turn (but searching doesn't
  activate, and you should use '_' to enter a store without taking
  a turn)
* Under the knowledge ('~') command, there is a new self knowledge
  sub-command, but it is not the same as the magical effect...
* Added circular rooms from Ying-Yangband by Dag Arneson (does every
  variant have this now? ;-)
* Raised the quality of treasure in the "cross-shaped, inner
  vault" room type (Remco Gerlich)
* Changed the names of certain "novice xxx" monsters and other
  monsters which have the same name as each other
* Applied Keldon Jones' "center panel on player" patch, adding two
  options in the Goingband Options screen
* Added dungeon level/max to the character display
* Removed the "EVIL implies RES_NETH" stuff
* (Aidan Ryder) Chests drop good items; changed the levels of chests
* The roguelike set now uses the ']' key for the 'repeat last command'
  command, and the multiple artifact and monster inventory bugs were
  fixed due to the Recall Patch 1.1
* (Tim Baker) Fixed bug in earthquake routine where monsters would
  end up in walls
* Alter Reality updates stores and generates a new town layout

Goingband is now among the Angband variants listed at Bablos's page:

Darin Takemoto has ported Goingband 2.8.3v3 for the Macintosh (68K):
  ftp://export.andrew.cmu.edu/angband/Incoming/goingband-2833.cpt.bin

--- Version 2.8.3v3, merge with GW-Angband (Sunjul 26, 1998) ---

* Added lots of things from GW-Angband, including three
  inappropriately named classes (GW-Mage, GW-Ranger, GW-Rogue),
  *not* including random artifacts (oh well... :-)
* Added Zangband's time-of-day command (CTRL-T)
* Quitting is no longer scored if you have no experience
* Activated the HURT_FIRE and HURT_COLD flags: branded weapons and
  distance attacks do double damage on such creatures, added these
  susceptibilities to many monsters
* Gabriel gets Mana Storm...
* Added the Seeker Arrow of Bard
* Activated RES_WATE, RES_PLAS, RES_NEXU, RES_NETH, RES_DISE for monsters
* Changed normal walls' color to 'slate'; if you 'l'ook at traps, they
  give more descriptive names; changed colors of veins
* If your memory is blanked, *all* inscriptions are removed, unless the
  item would not be otherwise affected by memory loss
* Demon pits occur at much lower levels; however, they now include
  minor demons; monster pits now use the monster flags instead of the
  race characters (this means that troll pits can now include skeleton
  trolls)
* Modifimplemented Andrew Berman's suggestions for *slay* items
* Fixed bug from Angband 2.8.3 with examining items with more than one
  screenful of powers (pointed out by Robin Smith)
* Added stat modifications/sustains to extended character dump
* If you press 'escape' at the 'more' prompt, you will stop receiving
  messages until a non-message-related keypress is asked for.
* Changed MICoM and Grond: both are (only) heavily cursed and aggravate
* The wizard create object command now can handle up to 60 different "kinds"
* Modifimplemented Joseph W. Dixon's "My Custom Artifacts"
* Added some more new monsters, mostly from r.g.r.a posts
* (weisiger) Detect Traps detects trapped chests

The Angband Variant ('v'/'v')
This creature breeds explosively and can be found at town level.  It
can summon the RNG, and is magical, casting spells to take over your
hard drive or cause you to become addicted to the game; 1 time in 4.
It can hit to lose sleep, hit to make you late to work, hit to lose
sleep and hit to drain intelligence and thereby cause stupid character
deaths and other stupid player tricks.

--- Version 2.8.3v2, bug fixes (Satjul 11, 1998) ---

When I say "bugs", I mean "bugs and warnings". Or do I?

* Changed makefiles to include wor.c/wor.o/wor.obj/wor.o32
* Fixed "extern" bugs with the Easy Patch, and other bugs with it
* Fixed small bugs with IGNORE_DISEN, 'C h *'
* Fixed bugs with store examine patch
* Fixed bug with artifact creation patch
* Included lib/user directory!
* Fixed bugs with extend_dump (being the first option > OLD_OPT_MAX
  didn't help)
* Changed the Midget's name to Twerp, and made Ga-Nat more greedy
  than Vella (maybe this was in v1?)
* Added "class_colors" option, to control whether your "@" is colored
* Added "race_chars" option, enabling races to have their own characters
  and colors, like Kamband, except a little different. Note that
  "class_colors" (partially) overrides "race_chars". "race_chars" is
  off by default, to appease The Law of Roguelike Games (the one that
  says, "You Are @.") (suggested by Mischa Gelman)
* Somewhere, made some as-yet-nonexistent spell attacks (like Gravity
  and Nexus) do more things to monsters
* Just now, changed it so that Ithyl-Mak/Ludwig/Kon-Dar
  aren't *that* cheap... :-)
* Consolidated all word-of-recall code (for you programmers out there,
  it's do_word_recall in xtra2.c)
* Added a new spell: ice storm. A few monsters have it...
* Resist nexus provides resistance to the "... teleports you away"
  spell and "phase door" effect of gravity
* If you have both feather fall and free action, you are immune to the
  slowing effects of inertia and gravity
* (Karl Peters) Warriors' Fear Resistance shows up on 'C h'
* Options summary includes info for 'n' (Repeat last command) command

The gruesome software bug ('l'/'l')
It breeds explosively, moves invisibly and very fast. It can cast
spells which paralyze the game, produce errors which slow the game
down, and cause hallucination, 1 time in 2. It can leap at you 
to crash the game, leap at you to crash the game, leap at you 
to crash the game, leap at you to corrupt your savefile, and
leap at you to crash the game.

--- Version 2.8.3v1, initial release (Tuejun 7, 1998) ---

* Applied Tim Baker's Easy Patch 1.1
* Applied Tim Baker's Recall Patch 1.0
* Applied dsb's rod-sorting patch
* Applied Daniel Nash's '^aC' wizard artifact creation patch
  (noticed at 1.2)
* Applied James D. Lockwood's "store examine" patch
* Applied David Blackston's damage rating patch
* Applied Keldon Jones's widely-circulated monster AI patch,
  and added a new option to toggle it (which is off by default)
* Greg Wooledge's fear/sleep health bars, plus my own
  for confusion/stun
* Classes now color that '@' that we know and either love or hate
  (this should be made into a "class_chars" option in the future)
* A new item flag, "IGNORE_DISEN" (but nothing uses this yet)
* GoI tweaked a little:
  * monster distance attacks bypass invulnerability
  * attempting to engage in hand-to-hand combat while
    invulnerable just has you switch places with that monster
  * Thus the name Goingband.
* Bronze, Gold, and Shining dragon pits now available
* "Detect doors" detects locked doors now
* Monster inventories are now part of savefiles
* The "Hack -- save/restore memory" in monster1.c is patched
* The 4/6 keys no longer are legal keys in options screens
* The "keymap_dump" bug was fixed in the more straightforward manner
  (using Greg Harvey's patch)
* Character dumps now include (part of) the 'C h' screen,
  which now displays immunities as '*' (idea and some
  code from GJW) if you use the "extend_dump" option
* Stat bonuses with sustains are now displayed correctly in 'C h'
* Resist chaos displays a '*' in resist confusion in 'C h', and "S.Dig"
  was changed to "SlowD"
* No more flavored "Amulet s" (note the space, that's what I got rid of!)
* (from COLORS.DIF) New "spell_colors" option
* The quitting prompts now prompt for SUICIDE (like
  GW-Angband), and, if you quit, your score is registered.
* Auto-haggle is off by default (I like haggling!), and the testing
  options are on by default
* r_info now has a limit of around 575, v_info of 511, options of 128
* Some more monsters in r_info.txt have exceptional drops
* Several other changes in r_info.txt
* Vault changes: three new vaults, info on making vaults, three
  new vault specifiers from Kangband/Kamband (';', 'T', 'D')
* Minor spelling change
* Debug mode and spoilers generation are compiled in
  by default
* Number of turns included in character dump
* Artifacts *can* break (but not as easily as regular objects),
  to allow for the future Seeker Arrow of Bard

DONE:
. Bug: Recall Patch 1.0 generates multiple artifacts with preserve mode
  (because of this, "remember_recall" is now off by default, but this is
  just a hack until a new version of the Recall Patch comes out) (fixed
  in 2.8.3v4)
. Bug: monster_place (or whatever it's called) doesn't take into account
  hold_o_idx, so monster inventories still don't get restored XXX XXX XXX
  (fixed in 2.8.3v4)
, Orc/yeek uniques should insult you without taking up precious
  (no, not Smeagol's) melee attacks... (see below for similar idea)
. Monster elemental susceptibilities! (done for fire/cold in 2.8.3v3)
. (like Zangband) Have a specialized form of talking uniques, where you
  can give messages to each unique monster. Make a generic set of speech
  lines for non-specific uniques. Differentiate bravado and fear. (done
  in 2.8.3v4)
. (Aidan Ryder) Monsters should be less resistant; most EVIL monsters
  should not resist nether (done in 2.8.3v4), more susceptibilities
  (done in 2.8.3v3)
. (several) Should give not just info on "cuts", "stuns", "paralyzation"
  but also "bless", "heroism", "berserker", etc. (done in 2.8.3v4)

TO DO:
* Sleep brand for ammo (!!!)
* Items which actually use IGNORE_DISEN
* Taking an idea from Zangband: magicbane weapons! They will give you
  an amount proportional to the number of RF5/RF6 spells the monster has.
  Maybe also include charge-draining attacks?
* Change the maximum number of monster blows to 8
* Also BR_PARA, but GF_OLD_SLEEP should be able to work on
  player before I do this
* Add new town buildings (bookstore, castle, arena, gambling house,
  adventurer's guild, etc.)
* Be able to customize town, spells, races, classes,
  (!!!) artifact activations
* Add "auto_stair" option that will make stairs go up/down
  approximately 1d6 levels (somewhat like Cthangband)
* Add highscore-summarising features, like "angscore"
* Add "video recorder" mechanism
* Add lots of things from GW-Angband (2.8.3v3), Kangband, Kamband
  (both have annoying bugs now), Cthangband, and Zangband
* Add a spell to command a monster to return to where you are
* Have chests give items based on the level on which they were created
* More detailed monster descriptions (weisiger is working on this)
* Black Market: be able to order items, either
  price = base price * turns to generate
  price = level^2 * turns to generate, prepay 10 turns
* Scrolls of Endurance that reduce chances of player items being destroyed
  due to acid/fire/elec/cold damage; SHATTER attacks should try to destroy
  player items
* A new "spell", Energy Drain, will remove 1 hit die of a monster. When
  done, will turn the monster into an undead (skeleton/zombie/mummy) under
  your control. This does not work on EMPTY_MIND monsters.
* "spell_colors" modifiable by font pref files

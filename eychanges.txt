Changes from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2:

- Savegame format changed - older savefiles can be read, but magic-users will discover that
  they have to relearn all their spells (0.1.0 savefiles will also suffer all the effects
  of converting to 0.1.1).

- Added Oangband style rod stacking (but not wand stacking).

- Incorporated the autosquelch patch (by David T. Blackston).

- Updated Iain McFall's monster list patch to the latest version.

- Alchemy has been revised. Now, there is only a single combination of potions to create
  each potion, which is randomly determined at the beginning of the game. When a player
  drinks a potion, there is a chance (depending on his alchemy skill) that he will learn
  the formula to produce it. Known alchemical formulae can be accessed from the 
  "knowledge" screen ("~"), then choosing 4. Note that Alchemy is never certain, and
  the chance is dependant on the quality of the resulting potion - so even if you know
  the forumla for potions of *resistance* you'll probably not be able to mass-produce them
  without a very high alchemy skill. Alchemy skill is now also influenced by intelligence.
  Casting *identify* on a potion will reveal how to make it and in what formulae it is a
  member.

- Removed the concept of "realms" from the spell system. Now, different classes get to
  pick a list of spellbooks in c_info.txt, and specify a handicap for each. 

- Usable spellbooks appear in the inventory in the same color as they are on the ground.
  Unusable spellbooks appear dark grey.

- Rangers can no longer use the fourth mage spellbook (but they can still use the first
  two dungeon books). Instead, they get a new dungeon spellbook of their own.

- Priest spell "elemental brand" replaced with "Sanctify Shots", which gives bullets and
  shots slay evil.

- Fixed the running and targetting bugs while using monster lights.

- Trying to destroy an artifact will inscribe it with "indestructible" if not pseduo-id'd,
  or "special"/"terrible" if already pseudo id'd as "good" or "cursed". Also, if it's 
  already known to be "indestructible", pseduo ID will still work (and provide the correct
  inscription).

- Finally fixed the PSEDUO_ID flags in c_info.txt so that paladins get slow pseduo-id 
  and priests get faster pseduo_id (as in vanilla).

- Good drops will now drop some of the new objects.

- Doubled the maximum amount of objects in z_info.txt to 512.

## Item Changes ##

- Whips are no longer sold at the temple, wooden clubs are.

- Paladins no longer start with a spellbook. Instead, they get a shield.

- The Fail penalty of the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom altered somewhat.

- Added scroll of elemental brand (more powerful than old spell - can create weapons of 
  all four elements, and can enchant piles of missiles as well).

- Potions of resistance and *resistance* now properly identified when used.

- Potions of satisfy hunger made more expensive.

- Fixed bugs in mushrooms (thanks to Ron Boucher for noticing them).

## Monster Changes ##

- Rat-things made slightly deeper and they now give more experience.

Changes from 0.1.0b to 0.1.1:

## General Changes ##

- Incorporated Dr. Andrew White's Monster light patch, which can be turned on and off by
  a user-configurable option.

- Incorporated Prnoff's custom quests from a2.9.1 (though no new quests have been added).

- Incorporated Iain McFall's monster list patch (as usual, I altered the color scheme a 
  bit).

    items, and specify quantities for each.
  - Class titles are now definable in "T:" lines.
  - The "G:", "I:", and "M:" lines have been combined.
  - Classes can now recieve two different spell stats, in which case mana and fail

- Mana and fail rates for mystics now determined by both intelligence and wisdom.

- The ranger now starts with a few arrows.

- Greatly reduced chance of potion mixing success. (The promised revision of potion
  mixing will take place in the next version)

- Colorized monster memory, using green for all numbers except level of out of depth 
  monsters which is red. (inspired by CatHangband)

- Removed a nasty bug that caused Morgoth never to appear.

- Altered savefile format and added routines for converting 0.1.0 savefiles, with the 
  following caveats:
  - Games with Randarts will not be converted.
  - Rings might be transformed into other rings - however, in all cases, the new ring
    is better than the one it replaces, and includes the old ring's functionality.
  - All "flavor" objects (potions, scrolls, wands, amulets, etc.) will now be known.
  - You should delete any {playername}.prf files created by 0.1.0 unless you want
    Morgoth to be a white G.

- Mage spell "absorb hit" altered (can now absorb more than one hit per casting, but is
  timed).

- Changed display of hitpoints and spellpoints on the main screen - instead of two rows 
  each they now take one row each ("current/maximum").

- Fixed a bug in the inventory of the mage store.

- Mana is no longer incorrectly displayed if you wear armor heavy enough to reduce your
  max mana to 0.

    - Sustain rings combined : strength and charisma, dexterity and constitution, wisdom
      and intelligence.

    - Rings of Fire, Ice, and Acid now provide immunity to their elements, but have been
      made much rarer and deeper, and provide a lower bonus to AC.
    - Added Rings of Lightning, Resist Confusion, Resist Acid and Electricity, and 
      Greatness (+ to all stats).
    - Added cursed rings of slowness and drain life. 

  - Amulet of Intelligence added (note that amulets of stat do NOT sustain stats like rings
    of stat do).

  - Skeletons (the item, not the monster) have been totally removed from the game.

  - Cloaks of Stealth give bigger stealth bonus.

- The Phial of Galadriel's depth has been lowered slightly, to make it a bit harder to

###########################################################################################

Changes from 0.0.2 to 0.1.0:

## General Changes ##

- Classes are now configurable using the new c_info.txt file. It's currently sort of 
  rought around the edges, and it does something really ugly in order to give you the 
  level titles - I'll fix it next version. 

- Added two new races - Angel and Demon: Both are different from other races in that 
  their racial name and bonuses do not remain static, but rather grow with the levels.
  (these additional bonuses take effect even if maximize is off). They both start out 
  very weak, and grow into real power machines. In addition, they gain racial powers
  which can be activated using the "U" command ("O" on the roguelike set). These racial
  powers improve over the levels. On the down side, not only do both races have high 
  experience requirements, demons get far less experience from killing evil creatures, and
  angels get far less experience from killing non-evil creatures - which makes advancement
  much harder for both races (uniques always give full exp, though).

- Added Mystic class, as follows:
 - Mystics use wisdom as their spellcasting stat, get twice the mana other classes do
   for comparable stats/level, and gain spells faster. Also, their spells tend to have
   greater effects.
 - They can use the first 4 mage books and the first 3 priest books, and all the
   artifact books. They also get two new dungeon spellbooks, with a very powerful
   selection of spells.
 - They can cast spells when confused or blinded, but only from the two new spellbooks.
 - They are the worst fighters in the game, and only slightly better with magical devices
   than warriors. Mystics are supposed to rely on their spells. They do have a high throw
   skill, though (see below).

- Removed the "maximize" option. Race bonuses are always "maximized", i.e. they are applied
  throughout the game. Class bonuses are only applied during character creation. 

- Changed the way skills are stored, to enable easier addition of skills in this and future 
  versions.

- Dig skill is now adjustable by class/race. Elfs, high-elfs, and angels now get a small
  minus to dig. Half-orcs and Half-trolls now get a small bonus to dig. Dwarves and gnomes 
  get a larger bonus. Class does not currently affect digging.

- Throwing skill is now seperate from bow skill.  Halflings get a slightly higher throw 
  skill than their shooting skill. Half-orcs and half-trolls do not get a throwing penalty,
  despite getting a bow penalty. High-elves and Dunadan are less skillful in throwing than
  in shooting. All classes have equal throwing and bow skills except warriors and mystics 
  who are better at throwing (warrior bow skill has not been changed). Note that throwing
  skill is not effected by the quality of your shooting weapon and thus is higher to 
  raise. 	  

- There is a new Alchemy skill used for mixing potions (see below). Mages are best at it,
  then rangers, mystics, priests, and warriors. Paladins are terrible at it. Gnomes get a 
  bonus and hobbits get a slightly lower bonus.

- p_info format updated to reflect above changes.

- Changed the character display screen to reflect the above changes.

- Added a "U:" field in p_info.txt which determines special racial powers.

- Players can now mix potions using the new "x" command ("$" on roguelike keyboard). You
  have to supply two different potions, which are then destroyed and a third potion is 
  created. The potion created for each combination of potions is randomly determined at 
  character creation. The chance for success decreases the more the resulting potion is
  worth, and is modified by the character's alchemy skill. If the success chance is low,
  the player may take damage from the failure. Since there is no way to determine what 
  potion will be created without trying at least once, this is risky at best. 

- Autoscum is now a birth option - you can choose between autoscummed levels or not during
  character creation, and can't change your choice during the game.
  
- Updated p_info.txt to reflect the removal of rogues (oops).

- Added a book store (idea and some code stolen from Oangband). 

- Some store inventories changed:
 - Temple still sells a selection of scrolls, potions, and weapons, but some choices of 
   changed.
 - Alchemist now sells only powders (see below) and potions.
 - Spellbooks and other scrolls sold at the bookstore.
 - Magic store sells large selection of wands.

- The Black Market has been modified. It's inventory now depends on your recall depth, 
  making for less powerful (but cheaper) objects early on in the game, and better objects
  later on.

- Priest title "Priest Lord" changed to "Archpriest".

- Fixed a bug that turned the priest spell "call light" into "detect monsters".

- Added an option "verify destroy worthless objects" which defaults to false; unless it's 
  on, you don't need to verify the destruction of junk/cursed objects. (Oangband).

- Removed the following obsolete options: Use corners while running, Allow Quantity
  Specification.

## Item Changes ##

- Add new item type - throwing powders ('*'). 

- Implemented the item changes from Johnathan Ellis's edit patch, with some minor 
  modifications.

- Added Ethereal DSM.

## Monster Changes ##

- Implemented Johnathan Ellis's edit patch selectively - some monsters have been changed,
  added and removed according to it and other have stayed the same. Monsters I have removed
  in earlier version did not return.

- The storm of Unmagic has been beefed up, and made into a unique ("The Great Storm of 
  Unmagic").

- New monsters: Cockatrice, Wendigo, Pricurico, Dzoo-noo-qua, Troglodyte + many added from 
  Johnathan Ellis's patch

- Gug's now 'P' rather than 'G'.

## General Changes ##

- Spell browsing color schemed changed again.

- Broke the savefile format, and can not read 0.0.1 savefiles. Sorry about that.

- Mage spells rebalanced - added more offensive spells and defensive spells instead of 
  some of the detection and healing spells. Also, added a dimension door (controlled 
  teleport) spell. Globe of Invulnerability has been replaced by Globe of Resilence
  which reduces damage to 2/3. Also, mana costs and fail rates have been altered. 

- Rangers rebalanced. They now can get all the spells in the first 6 magic books (including 
  Genocide), they just get them 2 levels later, and higher level spells have a slightly 
  higher mana cost. However, they can no longer use the 3 most powerful books at all. 

- Paladins rebalanced. They can still use all of the prayer books but now recieve spells 4
  levels later than priests do - that means that in levels 1-4 they have to rely solely on
  melee. Higher level spells have considerably higher mana costs compared to priests. The
  minimum fail rate for paladins is now 7% (was 5%).

- Artifact spellbooks will not be affected by turning on randarts.

- Flasks of Oil have been renamed "Lantern Oil". They now only give 5000 turns of light, 
  do only 2d4 damage when thrown, and have been priced down to 2 GP.

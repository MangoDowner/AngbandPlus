This is the README file for Angband/64 beta release xx

Angband/64 beta xx is a variant, based upon Angband 2.7.9.6, with most of
the important innovations from the 2.8.x series.

general questions about Angband.


=== General information ===

Angband is a "graphical" dungeon adventure game using textual characters
to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein,
in the vein of "rogue", "hack", "nethack", and "moria".

There are extensive ascii "on line help" files in the "lib/help" directory.

Angband will run on Macintosh, Windows, Unix (X11/Curses),
Linux (X11/Curses), Acorn, Amiga, various IBM machines, and many others...

This variant will run on any machine that can run gcc and can run the original
Angband. Since I can only test it under MS-DOS and Linux, outside of that you
will have to compile and test for yourself.

See Makefile, h-config.h, and config.h for details on compiling.
See "Makefile.xxx" and "main-xxx.c" for various supported systems.

Visit the Angband Home Page ("http://www.voicenet.com/~benh/Angband/"),
and browse through the Angband newsgroup ("rec.games.roguelike.angband").

=== Quick and dirty compilation instructions ===

For 2 platforms (Linux / glibc 2 and MS-DOS >=386), a "pre-compiled"
archive is available, which contains everything you need to install and
play Angband/64 beta. For other platforms, including most UNIX systems,
you must compile the source code yourself.  Try the following non-trivial steps:

Step 1: Acquire.  Get the sources "from http://www.xs4all.nl/~thunder7"
Step 2: Extract.  Try "bunzip2 *.bz2" then "tar -xvf *.tar"
Step 3: Prepare.  Try "cd src", then edit "makefile"
                  You may also edit "h-config.h" and "config.h"
Step 4: Compile.  Try "make", and then "cd .." if successful
Step 5: Execute.  read the ang.sh script to get a feel for the command-line
                  options, or type angband -? for help
Step 6: Play....  Read the "online help" via the "?" command.

Of course, if you have a compiler, you can compile a (possibly customized)
executable on almost any system.  You will need the "source archive" (as
above), which contains the standard "src" and "lib" directories.

=== Upgrading from older versions (and/or other platforms) ===

Savefiles from Angband/64 and from other Angbnads are incompatible. (period)
I'm sorry, but the compatibility took far more time than it's worth.

In general, the savefile should be named "UUU.NNN" or "NNN" where "UUU" is the
userid of the player (on "multiuser" systems), and "NNN" is the name of the
"character" in the savefile.  Note that only "multiuser" platforms use the
"UUU.NNN" form, and the "dot" is required.

Angband uses a platform independant file format for the binary file used to
store the high score list.  This file is named "scores.raw".  To use an "old"
high score list, simply copy it into the "lib/apex" directory.

Angband uses a set of special ascii "configuration files" which are kept in
the "lib/file" directory.  These files should not be modified (or imported
from older versions) unless you know exactly what you are doing, but often you
can use "old" versions of these files with little trouble.

Angband uses a set of ascii "user pref files" which are kept in the "lib/user"
directory.  Most of these files can only be used on a small set of platforms,
and may need slight modifications when imported from older versions.  Note
that only some of these files are auto-loaded by the game.


=== Directory "src" ===

The "src" directory contains the complete set of "standard" source files.


=== Directory "lib" ===

The "lib" directory contains all of Angband's special sub-directories.


=== Directory "lib/apex" ===

The "lib/apex" directory contains the "high score" files.

The "scores.raw" file contains the "high score" table, in a "semi-binary" form,
that is, all the bytes in the file are normal ascii values, but this includes
the special "nul" or "zero" byte, which is used to separate and pad records.
You should probably not attempt to modify this file with a normal text editor.
This file should be (more or less) portable between different platforms.  It
must be present (or creatable) for the game to run correctly.


=== Directory "lib/bone" ===

The "lib/bone" directory is currently unused.


=== Directory "lib/data" ===

The "lib/data" directory contains various special binary data files.

The files 'f_info.raw', 'k_info.raw', 'a_info.raw', 'e_info.raw',
'r_info.raw', 't_info.raw', and 'v_info.raw' are binary image files
constructed by parsing the ascii template files in "lib/edit", described
below.  These files are required, but can be created by the game if the
"lib/edit" directory contains the proper files, and if the game was compiled
to allow this creation. Note that each of these files has a .hdr file with it,
which contains information used by the program about the contents of the .raw
files.


=== Directory "lib/edit" ===

The "lib/edit" directory contains various special ascii data files.

The files 'f_info.txt', 'k_info.txt', 'a_info.txt', 'e_info.txt',
'r_info.txt', 't_info.txt', and 'v_info.txt' are ascii template files used to
construct the binary image files in "lib/data", described above.  These files
describe the "terrain features", "object kinds", "artifacts", "ego-items",
"monster races", "traps", and "dungeon vaults", respectively.

The ascii template files are easier to edit than hard-coded arrays, and also
prevent compilation errors on some machines, and also shrink the size of the
binary executable, and also provide a user-readible spoiler file of sorts.

These files should not be modified unless you know exactly what you are doing.

These files are optional if the game is distributed with pre-created
binary raw files in "lib/data".


=== Directory "lib/file" ===

The "lib/file" directory contains various special ascii data files.

The 'news.txt' file is displayed to the user when the game starts up.  It
contains basic information such as my name and email address, and the names
of some of the people who have been responsible for previous versions of
Angband.  You may edit this file (slightly) to include local "site specific"
information such as who compiled the local executable.  You should refer the
user to a special "online help" file, if necessary, that describes any local
modifications in detail.  The first two lines of this file should be blank,
and only the next 20 lines should contain information.

The 'dead.txt' file is displayed to the user when the player dies.  It
contains a picture of a tombstone which is filled in with interesting
information about the dead player.  You should not edit this file.

The optional file 'wizards.txt' may be used to specify which users may enter
'wizard' mode.  A missing file provides no restrictions, and an empty file
prevents everyone from entering 'wizard' mode.  This file is only used on
multi-user machines, otherwise there are no restrictions.

The optional file 'time.txt' may be used to restrict the "times" at which
the game may be played, by providing specification of which hours of each day
of the week are legal for playing the game.  See 'files.c' for more details.
A missing file provides no restrictions, and an empty file will, by default,
forbid the playing of the game from 8am-5pm on weekdays.  This file is only
used on multi-user machines, and only if CHECK_TIME is defined, otherwise,
there are no restrictions.

The optional file 'load.txt' may be used to restrict the "load" which the game
may impose on the system.  See 'files.c' for more details.  A missing file
provides no restrictions, and an empty file will, by default, restrict the
"current load" to a maximal value of 100*FSCALE.  This file is only used on
multi-user machines, and only if CHECK_LOAD is defined, otherwise, there are
no restrictions.

These files should not be modified unless you know exactly what you are doing.


=== Directory "lib/help" ===

The "lib/help" directory contains the "online help" files.

This directory is used to search for normal "online help" files.


=== Directory "lib/info" ===

The "lib/info" directory contains the "online spoiler" files.

This directory is used to search for any "online help" file that cannot
be found in the "lib/help" directory.

This directory is empty by default.  Many people use this directory for
"online spoiler files", many of which are available.

Note that the default "help.hlp" file allows the "9" key to access a help
file called "spoiler.hlp", and allows the "0" key to access "user.hlp".

These special help files can thus be placed in the user's own "info"
directory to allow the on line help to access his files.


=== Directory "lib/save" ===

The "lib/save" directory contains "savefiles" for the players.

Each savefile is named "NNN" where "NNN" is the name of the character, or,
on some machines, the name of the character, or, on multi-user machines,
"UUU.NNN", where "UUU" is the player uid and "NNN" is the character name.

The savefiles should be portable between systems, assuming that the
appropriate renaming is perfomed.


=== Directory "lib/user" ===

The "lib/user" directory contains the "user pref files", if any.

In general, these files are used to "customize" aspects of the game for
a given site or a given player.

See "src/files.c" for information on the proper "format" of these files.


=== Directory "lib/xtra" ===

The "lib/xtra" directory contains special system files, if any.

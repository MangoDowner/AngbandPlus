This is Zangband 2.1.1ce, a version with various stuff added by me.

zangband-211ce-src.zip is the source;
zangband-211ce-win.zip is the Windows precompiled version.

Among the changes I've made:
- Zangband 2.2's pet menu has been added.
- Chaos warriors may choose their patron at startup.
- All chaos patrons grant some bonus abilities.
- Two new uniques to replace Qlzqqlzuup and Vecna.
- Three new chaos patrons: 
   Qlzqqlzuup, who mostly summons monsters, and grants a 'summon monster' ability
   Vecna, who grants a 'mind blast' ability
   Id, who is inspired by too much Doom :)  He provides Doom-like weapons at
       various levels.  (Note: most of the multiple-projectile weapons - such as
       the shotgun - are somewhat peculiar when fired at diagonally adjacent monsters,
       and tend to miss.  This is a 'feature' of Angband's bolt system.)
- Breath attacks are conical.
- Experience gained from a particular monster type decreases as more
  monsters of that type are killed.
- Weapons and armor may be given altered damage dice/base ac.

HAVE MUCH FUN !!!

Post Scriptum : Easyband is aimed to novice throught beginner player. The game is *very* easy at start, because of more HP,slaying weapon, few XP, but at higher level (35+) the game isn't much more different from standard Vanilla.
At these level every character is enough powerfull indipendently from class and race. So i have warned you this is Easyband not Gottakill'emallband.
A more challenge will be in Ironmode...

P.S.S: This game is dedicated to my wife, Federica, for all her patience and support.

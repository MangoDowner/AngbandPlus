  Bleeding Edge Angband

  This is not a variant.  So everyone can have the joy of playing with
the new patches, so they can comment in the angband newsgroup about how
great or how horrible they are, I'm putting as many patches into one
2.9.0 distribution as I can.
  
  I make no guarantees as to the stability of this patch mosh variant,
but you should have gotten a clue of that from the first line.  *grin*

  Right now I have:

  David T. Blackston's AutoSqueltching Patch
  Matthias Kurzke's e_info.txt Patch

  I'd like more, especially a fractal walls patch.  Patches, however,
should be switchable on and off.

  Regarding Jonathan Ellis's Edits Patch:

1) It's not a patch, it's a variant.  Probably a really good variant,
but a variant none the less.

2) I bet it's incompatible with Matthias's e_info patch.  I'm not sure,
but it seems really likely.  And, if Matthias's patch does everything
it's reputed to, and everything that it has the potential to do, then,
looking at Vanilla Angband as the 'breeding ground for variants' that
it is, Matthias's patch is just much more important than Ellis's patch.

  Enough mad compiling and run-on sentances for today.

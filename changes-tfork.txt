TFork 0.2

The most important change here... Permadeath is now DISABLED by default. Yes, you read
that correctly. Death will no longer invalidate your save file, unless you SPECIFICALLY
enable the perma_death option in Gameplay Options. Using debug commands or Wizard mode
WILL save your game automatically so your save file is marked.

Why? IMO, permadeath is a huge waste of time outside of competitions, and cheat_live
removes all need for thought in the game since you'll just be magically resurrected
if you die. Non-permadeath mode allows you to play in a less paranoid fashion, but
doesn't prevent you from landing yourself in an irreparable pickle, and allows you to
replay fights you goofed the first time. It is, in short, a much saner choice for most
anyone who plays the game for fun.

If you want permadeath, you can reenable it. If I get enough complaints, I may leave
permadeath enabled by default. But the option to turn it off will stay. Period.

Now on to other changes...

- This is a rewrite from 2.3.8-ah git branch. Tactics are back.
- Stats are randomly boosted on level up.
- Removed CMake stuff.
- Spread Blows ability now depends on Combat, so monks and other barehand 
fighters can get it.
- Thaumaturgy is fixed. Again. :)
- Monster leveling in dungeons is IMO totally broken and so has been removed.
- Perception and Searching now scale at 6:1, and Disarming at 4:1, from their 
respective skills. Sounds ridiculous, yes, but otherwise these skills are impractical.
- Likewise, Saving Throw scales twice as fast from Spirituality, so your 
Warrior CAN get a decent score now.
- Runecraft is broken and has been disabled. It will probably be removed in 
future versions.
- Antimagic has been changed. A lot. Dark swords are gone, and the enchantment 
malus is gone too; and AM can now block breaths... But the spell blocking code
does a check against monster level. Currently Morgoth has a 1/3 chance of 
breaking through a L50 Unbeliever's AM field, I'll change this as necessary.
- Mimicry 
-no longer requires sight, and Mimics can now do their magic without 
cloaks. The Mimicry menu is kind of shoddy right now, I'll fix it at some point.
- Fixed a couple of null pointer exception bugs in z-util.c that I should have 
noticed a while ago :o
- Due to the Antimagic changes Dark Swords have been removed; Mormegil is now a 
two-handed sword.
- Geyser once again does decent damage, and Mind school spells are once again damaging.

-----  Basic for Playing  ------
All the following texts were generated by automatic translation.
I am sorry to be the text which is hard to read.

-- Play

If it is a standard setup, it will move with a ten key and a command
input will be performed by the full key.
When a command is not known, if a return key or the 'x' key is pushed,
a command menu Since it comes out, it can choose out of there and can perform.
The alphabet currently attached to the last of a command is a key for executing
a command.
"(R) which rests" even pushes 'R' -- it can perform (a capital letter and
a small letter distinguish) -- if it is key arrangement of the standard
"investigates the surroundings (l/x)" and is 'l' and ROGU-like key
arrangement -- 'x' Pushing can also perform.


We recommend you to go to "Yeek cave" of the ground of a frontier district 
which is next immediately at first. Although the King of Yeeks where it 
lives in the deepest story is a formidable enemy, it is safe here except 
it. It is a small cave. If it becomes as strong as this dungeon can be 
completed, it will come out out of a town.
Probably, it will be good in diving into various dungeons. If neither much 
food nor the roll of hungry sufficiency is brought when coming out out of 
a town It does not arrange. Since this world is very large, when coming out 
out of a town, it goes into a broader-based map by '<'. The method of 
movement of usually returning to a map by '>' in the place attached to the 
destination is convenient. Although a way and a prairie are comparatively 
safe in a wilderness,  a powerful monster a lava zone and sea top It is and 
is dangerous. It does not arrange, unless it becomes still stronger, 
in order to go to such places.

In the adventure person of a beginner, it is still too difficult for the volcano
on the same island as the ground of a frontier district. Probably, it will be good
in returning, after becoming stronger. When it goes west, there is a cave where
an oak lives the ground of a frontier district and near the middle of MORIBANTO.
There is a labyrinth of the magic which will be spoken about if MINOTAUROSU lives
in the island of the south. It is waiting for an adventure person with many brave
dungeons to visit otherwise. It is the dungeon which becomes main of this game,
and is the last purpose. For the dungeon of Angband in which "Serpent of Chaos"
lives, a map is a center mostly. It is located in the northeast of Moriband.


--- Commands


A command distinguishes a capital letter and a small letter. Since many commands
are small letters, let's turn OFF Caps. Although the following commands are not
all The command seldom used is enough if it chooses with the menu of a return key.
"u/Z" means Z if original keyset, and u if Rogue-like keyset.

--- inscription 

Below, only the point extended from "Zangband" is explained.

- You can inscribe on spellbooks with "@ma" or "@m"+any alphabet letter.
  Then, type these alphabet letter in 'm' command to cast from the spellbook.

- You can inscribe on *identified* items with "%" or "%all".
  Then, "%" or "%all" is automatically replaced by strings which describe the item's
  abilities. 
  Ex. You inscribe with "%all" on a pair of gauntlets of power which provide 
  resistance to fire, then the description will look like {St;Fi} which means 
  bonus to Strength and resistance to fire.
  And if You inscribe it with "%", its description will look like {Fi} which means
  its random added ability is resistance to fire.


---- Auto pickup

At first, please make file named "pickpref.prf" or "pickpref-(character's name).prf" in 
the directry same as your user preference file is, It is in ~/.angband/Hengband/ if UNIX,or hengband/lib/user/ if other OS.

pickpref.prf is read every time. pickpref-(character's name).prf is read only when 
the player name is (character's name). Priority is given over pickpref.prf. 
pickpref-(character's name).prf is later,
These files are read at the time of starting of a game.
By the '$' command It can reread. When you want to have come to rewrite a file
during a play Probably, it will be convenient.

Next, the made file is edited by suitable editors, such as a memo pad.
One item is written to one line.

Example of the file
--------------------------------------------------------

!ruined chest
!chest (empty)

Basicaly, If the character sequence written to the file is contained in a part 
of the name, the item is picked up automatically.
On however, the header character ! means to destroy the item automatically.
On moreover, the header character ~ means to leaves the items on the floor as it is
without gathering or destroying.

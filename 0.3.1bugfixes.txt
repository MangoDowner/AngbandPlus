Bugs fixed in 0.3.1b -

- MOVE_BODY and KILL_BODY didn't work.
- Random sustains of ego items were being spoiled.
- A bug prevented the monster memory of being updated with monster teleport spells.
- LUCK didn't affect items created by mimics.
- Several makefiles were out of date. (Thanks Adam Horowitz and Gwidon S. Naskarent for 
  reminding me).
- A bug with the display of the priest spell "Orb of Draining". (Thanks Julian Lighton for
  noticing).
- A minor bug with the recharging of rods (Thanks Julian Lighton for noticing).

  down again). 
- The FRIENDS flag could create groups that were too large.

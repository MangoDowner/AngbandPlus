Note that these are play balance bugs only, there are no known stability
bugs (Fingers crossed).

- Death and high scores do not record styles and sub-styles.
- Updated birth.txt is incomplete.
- Should add kobolds from JLE's patch.
- Not all the monsters from the future.txt file are created yet. Also the
Zangband monsters imported still need massaging to fit.
- Summon spells don't summon anything... this will be waiting on the next
feature release as there is no(t much) point summoning a monster if all it
does is attack you.
- Room descriptions are not saved. This is currently by design...
- Come to mention it, flow code is broken for fleeing monsters. We should
choose a path that doesn't lead to dead ends. Fleeing monsters currently
have no preference in this regard.
- Need to notify the player they are singing/playing and when they are using
their preferred style.
- Spells that create bridges, raise and lower water should be temporary,
to prevent unreachable areas and getting monsters stuck on terrain (Which is
not handled well).
- Wall spells should create walls. However only temporary ones. (See
previous bug). This can be achieved (maybe) through smart use of spell
objects, especially with a NEVER_GET flag.
- Travelling over shallow and deep terrain is still not handled well enough.
- We cannot swim underwater yet. (Or climb for that matter).
- Increasing number of objects and monsters has rendered the much-needed save
file import compatibility with Angband gone. But RR has broken this by saving
artifacts with the new version. I haven't decided how to resolve this. Save
file compatibility between versions of UnAngband will take a hammering.
Sorry. But its OK, because I only release a new version every 6 months.  ;-)
- (Style bug) Don't try reading code for monster movement now. Its damn hard
to understand.
- We are (again) 2 point releases behind the Angband code state of the play.
Does anyone have a list of patches in order to get the code up to 2.9.3.
- Its a shame because it would look good, but monster lite code is not in
this version. Because I think its a nasty hack.
- Two-weapon style is available, but we can't wield two weapons yet.
- Need to implement options so that we can play as close to the Vanilla game
as possible, so that people can test the various settings.
- Need to update Dragon armors.
- Have said that ego items can use tvals other than their wield slot. This
is not implemented in the code yet.

- Monsters are not correctly summoned/created on terrain type which is not
floor.
- Monsters do not flow at all correctly. Consider disabling as this is a big
can of worms. Note that in vanilla flowing is still broken for KILL_WALL/
PASS_WALL monsters and permanent rock which we could consider a sub-problem
of the whole flow over different terrain types issue. So perhaps a different
pathing algorithm / flow lists by monster might be used.
- We can generate unconnected spaces as part of lake generation. Should
always ensure that points generated in a lake are all connected, if even
only diagonally.
- We can generated unconnected spaces as a part of big lake generation,
followed by room placement. Should always ensure that room placement does
not block lake segments.

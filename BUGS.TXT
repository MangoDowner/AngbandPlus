- We can generate unconnected spaces as part of lake generation. Should
always ensure that points generated in a lake are all connected, if even
only diagonally.
- We can generated unconnected spaces as a part of big lake generation,
followed by room placement. Should always ensure that room placement does
not block lake segments.

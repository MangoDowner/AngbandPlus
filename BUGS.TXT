- Looking is badly broken.
- Running is probably broken, despite changes, so will need to be thoroughly tested.
- Monsters do not correctly move over different terrain types still.
- Monsters are not correctly summoned/created on terrain type which is not floor.
- Monsters do not flow at all correctly. Consider disabling as this is a big can of worms. Note that in vanilla flowing is still broken for KILL_WALL/PASS_WALL monsters and permanent rock which we could consider a sub-problem of the whole flow over different terrain types issue. So perhaps a different pathing algorithm / flow lists by monster might be used.
- Traps that cast spells are broken now.
- Some new feature functionality not implemented yet or not working correctly eg DEEP, SHALLOW.
- MF_HIDE flags are not correctly working and will cause monsters to disappear intermittently when on, walking off terrain that they can hide under.
- Thieves do not teleport once they steal anymore. This may be a feature, not a bug. (See todo.txt)
- We can generate unconnected spaces as part of lake generation. Should always
ensure that points generated in a lake are all connected, if even only diagonally.
- We can generated unconnected spaces as a part of big lake generation, followed by
room placement. Should always ensure that room placement does not block lake segments.

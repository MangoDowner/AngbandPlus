Note that these are play balance bugs only, there are no known stability
bugs (Fingers crossed).

- Names of some artifacts when random artifacts is off are prematurely
shortened.
- Chests are not handled 100% yet (You never hit a trap on them).
- Features are almost always referred to using the wrong pronoun.
- You should not be able to pick up an item in a location that does
not have the DROP flag, and not be able to move if you are on a
location that does not have an EASY_CLIMB or MOVE flag.
- You should be able to traverse rubble. But requiring 2 moves.
- Monsters need more information saved.

- Campaign mode is broken.

- Mushroom weirdness from mushroom patch drops.

- Death and high scores do not record styles and sub-styles.
- Updated birth.txt is incomplete.
- Should add kobolds from JLE's patch.
- Not all the monsters from the future.txt file are created yet. Also the
Zangband monsters imported still need massaging to fit.
- Need to notify the player they are singing/playing.
- We are (now) many point releases behind the Angband code state of the play.
- Its a shame because it would look good, but monster lite code is not in
this version.

- We can generate unconnected spaces as part of lake generation. Should
always ensure that points generated in a lake are all connected, if even
only diagonally.
- We can generated unconnected spaces as a part of big lake generation,
followed by room placement. Should always ensure that room placement does
not block lake segments.

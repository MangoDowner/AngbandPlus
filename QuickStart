For installing, here are some things to remember:

1  Be sure all directories are present under lib/:

   apex
   bone
   data
   edit
   file
   help
   save
   temp
   user
   xtra

   If not, you either have not extracted the sources correctly, or something else went wrong.

2  If you get weird behaviour inside the game, lots of strange objects, lots of (nothing) every-
   were, etc. and you have upgraded from a previous beta, please make sure that all files in
   lib/data, lib/edit and lib/save from the old beta are deleted/overwritten. Most complaints
   about this behaviour were solved this way.

3  Under Linux, make sure you have the right permissions, and have an environment variable called
   ANGBAND64_PATH pointing to the main lib dir, which is installed after in <somedir>/lib if you do
   unzip -d <somedir> a64lb_xx.zip. So make sure ANGBAND64_PATH=<somedir>/lib and put that (with an
   export ANGBAND64_PATH perhaps, depending on your shell) somewhere in your .profile. 
   If you compile from source, you'll get an executable called 'angband64'. That's the game. If you
   like, you can call it angband64-beta-x-release-y or something like that to differentiate the
   versions.

4  if you are just playing, and are not interested in some log files that help me debugging,
   try running without -l and without -x.

5  if you want info on the command-line arguments, type something like angband -? (or any other unknown
   command line argument).

6  If your character has dramatic fighting capability, be sure to check the tactics under 'C'.
   Some classes, such as mages, start in 'wary' mode or worse, thus hitting practically nothing.
   This is realistic, because mages should use magic......

7  If you have trouble with certain keys, you need to look through the changes.txt file, at least
   until I have revamped the documentation - for example, all magic is cast using 'z'.

8  I apologize if any text files or source files are unreadable on 80 columns wide screens. I use
   a 133x54 terminal, and try to keep things at 80 chars/line, but it's trying.

9  If you use another Unix, like Solaris or something like that, you'll have to fiddle with the
   makefile a bit. Please remove references like -m686, remove the .depend file or make a new
   one, etc.
   Basically, you should compile all source files like normal angband, keeping in mind that there
   are a bit more source files now (like object3.c and object4.c).

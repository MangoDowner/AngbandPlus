=== General Info ===

This is the readme file for Oangband 0.3.1 (November 5, 1998)

     Oangband is a variant of Angband, created to experiment with changes in melee algorithms, spells, items, monsters, a substantial reduction in both HPs and damage, and whatever else might both catch Leon Marrick's fancy and be practicable for him to code.  Appropriately, it is called Opinion-Angband, or Oangband for short.

     On-line help exists for all significant changes made, so make certain you have a look through at least some of the new help documents available through the "?" command.  In addition, the files with the complete list of changes, "A-020 diffs.txt", and "020-031 diffs.txt", can be found in the info/diffs directory.

     Oangband is based on Angband 2.8.3.  I hope you will join me in a paean of praise to Ben Harrison, whose excellent code has made so many variants of Angband possible.

     Expect another full version (more than bug-fixes) around Easter, 1999.


Yours,
Leon Marrick

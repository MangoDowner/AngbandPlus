=== General Info ===

This is the readme file for Oangband 0.4.0 (April 18, 1999)

     Oangband is a variant of Angband, created to experiment with changes in 
melee algorithms, spells, items, monsters, a substantial reduction in both HPs 
and damage, and whatever else might both catch Leon Marrick's fancy and be 
practicable for him to code.  Appropriately, it is called Opinion-Angband, or 
Oangband for short.

     On-line help exists for all significant changes made, so make certain you 
have a look through at least some of the new help documents available through 
the "?" command.  In addition, the file containing the complete list of 
changes from version 0.3.2 to 0.4.0 can be found in the lib/files directory.

     Oangband is based on Angband 2.8.3.  I hope you will join me in a paean of 
praise to Ben Harrison, whose excellent code has made so many variants of 
Angband possible.

     Expect another full version (more than bug-fixes) in the fall of 1999.


Yours,
Leon Marrick

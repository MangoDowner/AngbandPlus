Changes to Zceband 2.12:
- Multiple message tracking.  "You tunnel into the granite wall. <30x>"
- The game-crashing bug has disappeared.
- Players start with a larger basic inventory.
- A 'fiend' race.  It's...different.  Fiends may not wield weapons or bows, and
  may not wear lights, cloaks, gloves, or boots.  However, it's intended to be
  a warrior race.
- Angband 2.8.5 line-of-sight algorithm.
- Maps may be much larger than normal.
- Fixed the bug with multiple-projectile weapons.
- Increased the maximum number of random quests to 125.  (Note that using this number
  would produce a quest on every level)
- Added crushing ceilings.
- Added barrels.
- Added the Doom monsters.

Changes to Zangband 2.11ce from Zangband 2.11c:
- Zangband 2.2's pet menu has been added.
- Chaos warriors may choose their patron at startup.
- All chaos patrons grant some bonus abilities.
- Two new uniques to replace Qlzqqlzuup and Vecna.
- Three new chaos patrons: 
   Qlzqqlzuup, who mostly summons monsters, and grants a 'summon monster' ability
   Vecna, who grants a 'mind blast' ability
   Id, who is inspired by too much Doom :)  He provides Doom-like weapons at
       various levels.  (Note: most of the multiple-projectile weapons - such as
       the shotgun - are somewhat peculiar when fired at diagonally adjacent monsters,
       and tend to miss.  This is a 'feature' of Angband's bolt system.)
- Experience gained from a particular monster type decreases as more
  monsters of that type are killed.
- Weapons and armor may be given altered damage dice/base ac.

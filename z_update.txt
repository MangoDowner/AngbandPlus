This is a document file listing the changes in ZAngbaA (compared to
recent versions of ZAngband.) No long explanations, just a list. See code for
details. In reversed chronological order (more or less):

ZAngbaA 2.3.5
-You can now start over when selecting a realm.
-Added pits of "eldritch horror" monsters.
-The keys '[' and ']' have been freed up; buildings can be entered with the
 same command as stores; quests can be entered and exited with the stair
 commands (which are now the only way). The keys '^Q' and '|' have also been
 freed up; access their functions with the '~' key.
-Added the following changes from ZAngband 2.3.5:
    -Cleaned up monster fighting messages.
    -Quest entrances show now the name of the quest.

    -Disintegration balls are now stopped by permanent walls.
    -Corrected a bug which prevented monsters from casting non-bolt
     spells at monsters when a friend is between.
    -Shattered weapons are now 1d1 instead of 0d0.  This fixes the 'division
     by zero' error when getting a critical hit with such a weapon.
    -The EMPTY_MIND flag of monsters is now remembered by the player when
     an attack shows that the monster is immune to psi-powers.
    -Exploding monsters no longer hurt the player twice when exploding.

     better graphic-scaling on systems with HiColor/TrueColor mode
     (can be switched off with -s).
    -The mindcrafter 'domination' spell no longer affects quest monsters.

    -Artifacts now have a higher activation failure rate when cursed.
    -Added some new vaults by Eric Bock and tweaked a couple of others.
    -Added a "status bar" that displays certain timed effects under the
     stats. Timed effects previously already displayed like poison, wounds
     and stunning remain as they were.

     [Note: include details of how to do this?]
    -The 'M'ap now scales to the level size.

     and amulets.
    -Enhanced pack monster AI.
    -Monster memory, unique lists, spoilers, and kill counts are now sorted
     by monster level regardless of the monsters' index in r_info.txt.

     information and reformatted character dumps to prevent line wrapping.
    -Fixed the excessive disturbing messages produced by monsters fighting 
     each other.
    -Wands and staves will now stack properly when emptied.
    -Some changes to makefile.lsl and main-lsl and began work on getting
     the graphics to work including adding graf-lsl.prf (only vanilla
     monsters at present).
    -Many other bugfixes.
-Improved the level file syntax in preparation for customizable vaults.
-The "unified use command" option is now on by default.

 all classes, but is also no longer as good.

-The now-unused 'skip mutations' option is gone.
-The 'ironman small levels' option always generates 1x1 small levels.
 (Yes, that's very tough, but it's an ironman option.)
-Added various flags and stuff to features in f_info.txt. The features now are
 primarily indexed on the basis of these.

      - Psychic Drain is always a radius-0 ball, not bigger.
      - Adrenalin Channeling only heals when the player isn't already
        'heroed' ('herofied'? 'heroficated'?) and hasted.

/*
 * The new "VIEW" code maintains a "current viewable space", which
 * is used by the "player_has_los_bold()" macro to determine if the
 * player has line of sight to a grid.
 *
 * Note that pre-calculating the "viewable space" ahead of time has some
 * rather obvious advantages.  On of the most notable is that, since the
 * "maximal view area" is precalculated, it takes no time at all to note
 * that a given grid is NOT viewable, which otherwise takes up a lot of
 * processing power when many monsters are nearby.
 *
 * Also note that unless the player "moves" or "opens doors", there is
 * no need to recalculate the "viewable space", and even when doors are
 * opened, it only matters if that door itself was already viewable.
 * So, if the player is, say, resting, then the monsters can move around
 * without ever having to check "los()" from the player.  This results in
 * such a speedup over the old method that the old code has been removed.
 *
 * I wouldn't be surprised if slight modifications could prepare some field
 * in the cave array to indicate which grids have "los()" on the player...

/*
 * Can the player "see" the given grid in detail?
 *
 * He must have vision, illumination, and line of sight.
 *
 * Note -- "GRID_LITE" is only set if the "torch" has "los()".
 * So, given "GRID_LITE", we know that the grid is "fully visible".
 *
 * Note that "GRID_GLOW" makes little sense for a wall, since it would mean
 * that a wall is visible from any direction.  That would be odd.  Except
 * under wizard light, which might make sense.
 *
 * Note that the test for walls includes a loop which cannot use the
 * "floor_grid_bold()" function, since this function may be called on
 * a grid which is actually in the outer wall.
 *
 * Note that the special processing for checking illumination of walls
 * takes a little extra time, but provides a more "correct" metaphor.
 *
 * Note that it is very important *not* to run the final "wall checker"
 * loop on the outer walls of the dungeon (it will induce a memory fault).
 *
 * To speed up the function, we assume that all "perma-walls", once
 * perma-lit, are illuminated from all sides.  This is correct for all
 * cases except monster vaults and the buildings in town.  But the town
 * is a hack anyway, and the player has more important things on his
 * mind when he is attacking a monster vault.  Note that I hate to do
 * this, even though it is "just a little hack", but the savings in
 * processor time are rather extreme when "view_bright_lite" is set.

/*
 * And now for info on the "update_view()" function...  -BEN-
 *
 * The "update_view()" function maintains the "GRID_VIEW" and "GRID_XTRA"
 * flags for each grid, and maintains an array of all "GRID_VIEW" grids.
 * This set of grids is the complete set of all grids within line of sight
 * of the player, allowing the "player_has_los()" macro to work very fast.
 * In addition, the current algorithm sets "GRID_XTRA" for those grids
 * which are "easily" in line of sight of the player.
 *
 * The "update_lite()" function maintains the "GRID_LITE" (torch lit) flag
 * for each grid, and maintains an array of all "GRID_LITE" grids.  These
 * grids are the ones which are "illuminated" by the player's "torch".
 * Note that every "GRID_LITE" grid is also a "GRID_VIEW" grid, and in
 * fact, the player (unless blind) can always "see" all "GRID_LITE" grids,
 * except (perhaps) if they are "off screen" (on a different panel).
 *
 * Any grid can be marked as "GRID_GLOW" which means that the grid itself is
 * in some way permanently lit.  However, for the player to "see" anything
 * in the grid, as determined by "player_can_see()", the player must not be
 * blind, the grid must be marked as "GRID_VIEW", and, in addition, "wall"
 * grids, even if marked as "perma lit", are only illuminated if they touch
 * a grid which is not a wall and is marked both "GRID_GLOW" and "GRID_VIEW".
 *
 * To simplify various things, a grid may be marked as "GRID_MARK" which means
 * that even if the player cannot "see" the grid, he "knows" what is there.
 * This is used to "remember" walls/doors/stairs/floors/objects, and to
 * implement most of the "detection" spells.
 *
 * A grid may be marked as "GRID_ROOM" which means that it is part of a "room",
 * and should be illuminated by "lite room" and "darkness" spells.
 *
 * For various reasons, a grid may be marked as "GRID_SEEN" and put into the
 * array of "GRID_SEEN" grids.  This is a temporary flag/array, primarily used
 * for optimizing "update_view()" and "update_lite()", for spreading lite/dark
 * during "lite_room()" / "unlite_room()", and for calculating monster flow.
 *
 * The old "CAVE_INIT" flag is saved in savefiles, but is currently unused.
 * Note that the old system used "CAVE_INIT" because grids were not marked
 * as "GRID_GLOW" until they were first "seen", due to a brain dead method of
 * displaying rooms only when first seen, and of using the "GRID_GLOW" flag to
 * mark a room (or walls) as "known".  This was also done by "GRID_MARK", so
 * there was a lot of redundancy.  The old "check_view()" routine was called
 * a lot, and it "flooded" rooms with light when they were first encountered.
 * The "CAVE_INIT" flag allowed 2.7.0-2.7.3 to keep track of which rooms had
 * been flooded.  This was scrapped in 2.7.4v2 in favor of "update_view()",
 * previously optional on the "pre_compute_view" flag.
 *
 * Several flags are available to control which grids are "memorized", in
 * addition to those detected by various spells.  The "update_map()" function
 * allows the user to memorize all walls, all landmarks, all perma-lit grids,
 * and/or all torch-lit grids.  Note that turning off all four options is only
 * possible now that "update_view()" is required, and provides an "interesting"
 * way to only see the "currently known" grids.  Maybe the "borg" will use this.
 *
 * Note that the new "update_view()" method allows, among other things, a room
 * to be "partially" seen as the player approaches it, with a growing cone of
 * floor appearing as the player gets closer to the door.  Also, by not turning
 * on the "memorize perma-lit grids" option, the player will no longer have to
 * deal with "magic treasure".  An even better approach might be to add fields
 * to the "cave_type" structure to associate a "memory" (attr/char) with every
 * grid, and to use that "memory" whenever the "GRID_MARK" flag is set.  This
 * would also avoid the "magic object" problem.
 *
 * And my favorite "plus" is that you can now use a special option to draw the
 * walls/floors in the "viewable region" brightly (actually, to draw the *other*
 * grids dimly), providing a "pretty" effect as the player runs around.  This is
 * not recommended for slow machines, as it is one of the more abusive routines.
 */



/*
 * Some comments on the "update_view()" algorithm...
 *
 * The algorithm marks grids as "GRID_VIEW" if the player has "los()" to
 * the grid, and it marks them as "GRID_XTRA" if, in addition, the "los()"
 * is very "obvious" or "easily determinable".
 *
 * The algorithm is very fast, since it spreads "obvious" grids very quickly,
 * and only has to call "los()" on the borderline cases.  The major axes/diags
 * even terminate early when they hit walls.  I need to find a quick way
 * to "terminate" the other scans.
 *
 * Note that in the worst case (a big empty area with maybe 5% scattered walls),
 * each of the 1500 or so nearby grids is checked once, with most of them getting
 * an "instant" rating, and only a small portion requiring a call to "los()".
 * Note that the "town" provides a "pretty bad" case.
 *
 * In the "best" case (say, a normal stretch of corridor), the algorithm
 * makes one check for each viewable grid, and makes no calls to "los()".
 * So running in corridors is very fast, even if a monster pit is nearby.
 *
 * The only time that the algorithm appears to be "noticeably" too slow is
 * when running, and usually only in "town".  Note that resting, most normal
 * commands, and several forms of running, plus all commands executed near
 * large groups of monsters, are strictly more efficient with "update_view()"
 * that with the old "compute los() on demand" method.  So it is important to
 * optimize the "running" case.  One way to do this is to use one of the options
 * to reduce the view range when running.  This provides a gradual reduction of
 * the view range from 20 to 10 and then instantly back up to 20 when the player
 * stops running for whatever reason.  This is useful in town.  Actually, the
 * algorithm is pretty efficient, and may not need any more optimizations.
 */


/*
 * More comments on the update_view() algorithm...
 *
 * Note that we no longer have to do as many "los()" checks, since once the
 * "view" region has been built, very few things cause it to be "changed"
 * (player movement, and the opening/closing of doors, changes in wall status).
 * Note that door/wall changes are only relavant when the door/wall itself is
 * in the "view" region.
 *
 * The algorithm seems to only call "los()" from zero to ten times, usually only
 * when coming down a corridor into a room, or standing in a room, just misaligned
 * with a corridor.  So if, say, there are five "nearby" monsters, we will be
 * reducing the calls to "los()".
 *
 * I am thinking in terms of an algorithm that "walks" from the central point out
 * to the maximal "distance", at each point, determining the "view" code (above).
 * Note that for each grid not on a major axis or diagonal, the "view" code depends
 * on the "floor_grid_bold()" and "view" of exactly two other grids (the one along
 * the nearest diagonal, and the one next to that one, see "update_view_aux()"...).
 *
 * Notice that we "memorize" the viewable space array, so that at the cost of
 * under 3000 bytes, we reduce the time taken by "forget_view()" to one assignment
 * for each grid actually in the "viewable space".  And for another 3000 bytes,
 * we prevent "erase + redraw" ineffiencies via the "seen" set.
 *
 * A similar thing is done for "forget_lite()" in which case the savings are
 * much less, but save us from doing bizarre "temp_lite" maintenance checking.
 *
 * In the worst case (in the middle of the town), the reachable space actually
 * reaches to the largest possible "circle" of view, just under 1500 grids.
 *
 * Each grid G examines the "state" of two (?) other (adjacent) grids, G1 & G2.
 * If G1 is lite, G is lite.  Else if G2 is lite, G is half.  Else if G1 and G2
 * are both half, G is half.  Else G is dark.  It only takes 2 (or 4) bits to
 * "name" a grid, so (for MAX_RAD of 20) we could use 1600 bytes, and scan the
 * entire possible space (including initialization) in one step per grid.  If
 * we do the "clearing" as a separate step (and use an array of "view" grids),
 * then the clearing will take as many steps as grids that were viewed, and the
 * algorithm will be able to "stop" scanning at various points.
 * Oh, and outside of the "torch radius", only "lite" grids need to be scanned.
 *
 * And note that only "GRID_GLOW" and "GRID_ROOM" and "GRID_MARK" need to be saved
 * in the savefile, leaving us with a free bit-flag to save later.

/*
 * Calculate the viewable space
 *
 *  1: Process the player
 *  1a: The player is always (easily) viewable
 *  2: Process the diagonals
 *  2a: The diagonals are (easily) viewable up to the first wall
 *  3: Process the main axes
 *  3a: The main axes are (easily) viewable up to the first wall
 *  4: Process sequential "strips" in each of the eight octants
 *  4a: Each strip runs along the previous strip
 *  4b: The main axes are "previous" to the first strip
 *  4c: Process both "sides" of each "direction" of each strip
 *  4c1: Each side aborts as soon as possible
 *  4c2: Each side tells the next strip how far it has to check
 *
 * Note that the octant processing involves some pretty interesting
 * observations involving when a grid might possibly be viewable from
 * a given grid, and on the order in which the strips are processed.
 *
 * Note the use of the mathematical facts that:
 *   if (manhatten(dy,dx) < R) then (dist(dy,dx) < R)
 *   if (manhatten(dy,dx) > R*3/2) then (dist(dy,dx) > R)
 *
 * This is based on the observation that (1 < 1.415 < 1.5) and the speed
 * of the "manhatten()" function.  Look for "20" and "30" in the code below.
 * Also look for "15", when "propagating", since "n" is used for dx AND dy.
 * These values are now scaled to "MAX_SIGHT" (assumed to equal 20).
 *
 * A similar calculation is used by the "distance()" function to determine
 * that hypot(dx, dy) is almost equal to ((dx+dy+MAX(dx,dy)) / 2).
 *
 * This "optimization" replaces a "circle" with an "octagon" that completely
 * includes the circle, but gets pretty close to it at the major edges.
 * In this function, we only have to do the manhatten checks one-eighth of
 * the time, since the "octagon" is symetrical.  By "skipping" the corners
 * of the octagon (with very little speed cost), we skip one-eighth of the
 * possible 1681 grids, or 210 of 1681.  So the array only has to hold 1475
 * grids, call it 1500.
 *
 * The disadvantage of this is that it is now possible for grids which are
 * more than 20 grids away to be viewable.  In particular, in the town, this
 * algorithm thinks that certain grids which are 21 or 22 grids away are
 * actually in line of sight.  This causes problems with "update_mon()".
 * This also happens at the edges of "large" rooms.  I think this has been
 * fixed at very little cost.  The field of view appears circular now...
 *
 * Note the "optimizations" involving the "se","sw","ne","nw","es","en",
 * "ws","wn" variables.  They work like this: While travelling down the
 * south-bound strip just to the east of the main south axis, as soon as
 * we get to a grid which does not "transmit" viewing, if all of the strips
 * preceding us (in this case, just the main axis) had terminated at or before
 * the same point, then we can stop, and reset the "max distance" to ourself.
 * So, each strip (named by major axis plus offset, thus "se" in this case)
 * maintains a "blockage" variable, initialized during the main axis step,
 * and checks it whenever a blockage is observed.  After processing each
 * strip as far as the previous strip told us to process, the next strip is
 * told not to go farther than the current strip's farthest viewable grid,
 * unless open space is still available.  This uses the "k" variable.
 *
 * Note also the care taken to prevent "running off the map".  The use of
 * explicit checks on the "validity" of the "diagonal", and the fact that
 * the loops are never allowed to "leave" the map lets "update_view_aux()"
 * use the optimized version of "floor_grid_bold()".

			Reference Guide to Sangband

			(A Game Based on Angband)

		- Racial Information -

	Races are ranked on a scale from 1 to 10 in each skill with 1 being
the lowest possible score.  This represents how quickly you may advance the
skill.

	Humans advance fairly quickly in ALL areas, but they also start with
poor skill ratings, while High Elves and Dunedians advance slowly in ALL areas
but start with high skill ratings.

	Base Hit Dice is an indicator of how many Hit Points a given race
will have.  Endurance adds to this, but this is how many Hit Points any member
of the race will have.

	The lower the Stat Rank, the lower the stat will tend to be for that
race.  The scale is from 0 to 10, with 0 being the lowest.

Hum = Human	Hob = Hobbit	HlO = Half Orc	  HiE = High Elf
HlE = Half Elf	Gno = Gnome	HlT = Half Troll  DkE = Dark Elf
Elf = Elf	Dwa = Dwarf	Dun = Dunedian	  Gia = Giant

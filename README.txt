Welcome to Anquestria. It is very much a work in progress, but should be fully playable.

A great deal more work can be done, and anypony that wants to help is welcome, so if you want to help out, contact me at anquestria@gmail.com or visit one of the sites below.

Development progress can be followed at http://anquestria.blogspot.com/

Aquestria 0.12 changelist (things different from Angband 3.2):
Player races changed entirely
Shop owners changed
Character descriptions during character creation changed entirely
Glove encumberance for arcane casters changed to helm encumberance (can't cast as well with a covered horn, unless it is made for casters)
Executable icon and name changed
Some item and enemy name changes
Ranged attacks have been refactored (to benefit from gear +damage, and be more balanced at high levels)


A variety of tasks, for a wide range of skill sets, are available if you would like to help. Even if you have no experience with anything like this, feedback is always welcome.

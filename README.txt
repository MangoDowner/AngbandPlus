Welcome to Anquestria. It is very much a work in progress, but should be fully playable.

A great deal more work can be done, and anypony that wants to help is welcome, so if you want to help out, contact me at anquestria@gmail.com

Development progress can be followed at http://anquestria.blogspot.com/
Current source code can be found at https://github.com/natron77/Anquestria


Aquestria 0.1 changelist (things different from Angband 3.2):
Player races changed entirely
Shop owners changed
Character descriptions during character creation changed entirely
Glove encumberance for arcane casters changed to helm encumberance (can't cast as well with a covered horn, unless it is made for casters)
Executable icon and name changed
The Phial of Celestia artifact name change



List of easy work available:
New icon (32x32 bitmap, saved as .ico)
Retheming artifacts
Retheming monsters
Retheming ego items (Elvenkind to Pegasi or something)
Updating help files (currently reference Angband races)
Disabling some classes for some races (no pegasi/earth pony casters, for example)

List of work available to take this from an Angband reskin to a full variant:
Creating new artifacts
Creating new classes
Creating new spells
Creating new mechanics (flight, etc)

                           ************************************

Welcome to EyAngband, the Angband varient authored by Eytan Zweig. This readme
file gives a summary of the main new features that differentiate EyAngband from
normal (vanilla) Angband. For a more complete change list, check eychanges.txt
or the EyAngband website at http://members.xoom.com/eytanz/eyangband/ . 

1. New character races

EyAngband includes two new races - Angel and Demon: Both are different from other
races in that their racial name and bonuses do not remain static, but rather grow
with the levels. They both start out very weak, and grow into real power machines. 

2. Changes to character classes.

EyAngband modifies several of the character classes - mages and rangers both get
considerably different spell selections, paladin's magical abilities have been
rebalanced, and the rogue class has been totally removed. 

In addition, EyAngband offers a new character class - the Mystic, which can use
both mage and priest spellbooks, gains spells much faster, and has more mana 
available to it than any other class - but it is also the worse fighter of all.

3. Changes to gameplay

EyAngband offers many changes to normal Angband gameplay. Highlights include 
the replacement of the "maximize" option with a "half-maximize" mode, where 
race stat bouses are permanent but class bonuses only affect chracter generation,
a seperation of throwing and bow skills, player invisiblity, inclusion of 
auto-squelching and the monster-list terminal patches, a bookshop for scrolls 
and spellbooks, and many interface changes.

(note for people familiar with Drangband - player invisibility in EyAngband is
less powerful than in that varient - it only affects the chance of a monster
responding to you, it does NOT protect you from projectiles.)

4. Quests

EyAngband includes a new building - the adventurer's guild - where the player can
recieve random quests which can be completed for rewards. 

5. New items and monsters

EyAngband includes nearly 100 new monsters, and many new items, including some 
artifacts, especially new artifact lights and the new artifact spellbooks, which 
offer powerful spells but carry additional risks if the spell fails.

6. Alchemy

EyAngband allows players to mix potions to create new potions - a risk is involved,
as the potions may explode, but with some luck the player can create powerful rare
potions from cheap common ones.

7. More customability

EyAngband offers customizable character classes through the new c_info.txt file, and 
customizable fixed quests through the q_info.txt file.

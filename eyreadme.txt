                        ************************************

Welcome to EyAngband, the Angband varient authored by Eytan Zweig. This readme
file gives a summary of the main new features that differentiate EyAngband from
normal (vanilla) Angband. For a more complete change list, check eychanges.txt
or the EyAngband website at http://eyangband.sourceforge.net/ . 

1. New character races

EyAngband includes five new races 
- Angels, who are different from other races in that their racial name and 
  bonuses do not remain static, but rather grow with the levels. They start out
  very weak, and become really powerful. However, they only gain half normal
  EXP for killing non-evil creatures.
- Demons, who advance similarly to angels and can become mighty warriors or 
  mages.
- Nilbogs, a powerful warrior race with great stats that advance fairly 
  rapidly in levels but whose magical items lose their plusses.
- Rattikin, a half-roden race with great dexterity and innate resistance to
  disease.
- Felpurr, a half-feline race with decent all-round stats, and innate luck.

2. Changes to character classes.

EyAngband modifies several of the character classes - mages and rangers both 
get considerably different spell selections, paladin's magical abilities have
been rebalanced, and the rogue class has been totally removed. In addition, 
EyAngband offers three new character class 
- The mystic, which can use both mage and priest spellbooks, gains spells much
  faster, and has more mana available to it than any other class - but it is
  also the worse fighter of all. 
- The bard, who does not use spell books at all but rather musical instruments, 
  and combines decent fighting skills with spells that allow him to influence 
  the monsters around him or affect his own abilities.
- The Spellsword, a "pure" mage/warrior combo.

3. Changes to gameplay

EyAngband offers many changes to normal Angband gameplay. Highlights include 
the replacement of the "maximize" option with a "half-maximize" mode, where 
race stat bouses are permanent but class bonuses only affect chracter birth, 
monsters that can now be poisoned or blinded, a "diseased" condition for 
players, more resistances, a seperation of throwing and bow skills, player
invisiblity, inclusion of auto-squelching and the monster-list terminal
patches, a bookshop for scrolls and spellbooks, artifact memory, and many 
interface changes.

4. Quests

EyAngband includes a new building - the adventurer's guild - where the player
can recieve random quests which can be completed for rewards. 

5. New items and monsters

EyAngband includes nearly 120 more monsters and many more items, including over
30 new artifacts, than normal Angband. It includes new types of items, such as
throwing powders, magical lanterns, and artifact spellbooks, which provide rare 
and very powerful spells. Also, the existing item list has been reworked so that
there are far fewer useless items.

6. Alchemy

EyAngband allows players to mix potions to create new potions - a risk is 
involved, as the potions may explode, but with some luck the player can create 
powerful rare potions from cheap common ones.

7. More customability

EyAngband offers customizable character classes through the new c_info.txt 
file, and customizable fixed quests through the q_info.txt file.

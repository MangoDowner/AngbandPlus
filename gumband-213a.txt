****************************************************************************
Our story so far...
  It is the time of the Conjunction of a Million Spheres. Your Earth is
composed almost entirely of cave-riddled mountains (which have their own
dark inhabitants, known mostly by rumour), with villages in the few fertile
valleys that exist. Except for high summer, movement and trade between the
villages is almost impossible.
  Fresh rumour begins infiltrating the villages.  Rumours about the strange,
otherworldly beings that have begun to concentrate in the vast system of
caves under the mountains.  Rumours that the forces of Chaos are gathering
in unheard of numbers (led by three Chaos Lords referred to only as "The
Sword Rulers"), somewhere deep within the Earth, preparing for a great
battle with Law, upsetting the rule of the Cosmic Balance on your plane.
  Something needs to be done.  The Balance must be restored.  Someone must
journey to the bowels of the Earth and attempt to banish these Sword Rulers
from your plane...

=============================================
= Gumband 2.1.3a = Last Update: 03-Mar-2001 =
============================================================================
Changes from Gumband 2.1.2b are marked with '##'. Only the most major
changes are listed here, to keep things short...
============================================================================
Send any and all complaints (or praise ;) to aa343@chebucto.ns.ca. Patches,
makefiles, etc., should be sent to gumby_jd@yahoo.com.
============================================================================
PLEASE NOTE: Preserving savefile compatability is *NOT* important to me. I
*highly* suggest you finish up your current character with your current
version before moving to this one. At the very least, Monster Memory could
be severely messed up between versions...
============================================================================
My plans for this variant? Well, I plan to remove the Amber elements and
replace them with things that extend the already existing elements of
Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion cycle (represented in ZAngband by the
Chaos Patrons, the Sword (and Legion) of the Dawn and Stormbringer).  Stuff
other than the Amber elements will disappear, of course, if I find I need
the room. :)
============================================================================
I've only ever compiled this under MS-DOS with DJGPP. Your milage may vary
for other platforms and compilers... :) If you've had problems compiling
ZAngband v2.1.1c, then you'll probably have problems compiling Gumband.
  NOTE: I hear that there are major problems running the DOS version, and
compiling a Windows version with LCC, under Windows ME. I'm sorry, but since
I have no familiarity with either, there's nothing I can do. :( If someone
manages to get things working for that platform and/or compiler, could they
please mail me the makefile they used and any source files they needed to
update? [with explanatory notes, of course, so that I can add them without
breaking things for everyone else :]
============================================================================
Thanks to Bablos for compiling the Amiga version.
Thanks to Franklin Bratcher for compiling the Windows version.
============================================================================
Thanks to all the folks in #angband and rec.games.roguelike.angband who've
put up with me, and even helped me in many cases, while I was plundering
their knowledge of C for this little project. :) So, if you've responded to
any of my posts dealing with Gumband, or C programming in general, consider
yourself thanked. :) [individual thanks will be down there in the entries
that apply]
============================================================================
There have been other minor changes than those listed here that are no
longer worth individual mentions. Most changes to the monster, object and
artifact lists won't be included here, and some items might drop off the
list from time to time (to save space), tho that won't mean that the change
has been reversed.
============================================================================

##01) Implemented a quick start option. If you select it, your character
will start the game with mildly enchanted equipment in their inventory. The
enchantments include a minor Slay or Brand for weapons with a few plusses,
and one of the basic elemental resistances for armour. The Ranger's Short
Bow only gets plusses. Using this option will cut your final score in half
and character dumps will be marked.
NOTE: This change has broken savefile compatability. Savefiles from Gumband
v2.1.2b will *NOT* work with this version, so I suggest you finish up your
current game before upgrading.

##02) As Chaos Patrons, Mabelrode, Xiombarg and Arioch will now, not
counting 'wrath' and 'piss off' events, never TY Curse (unless, as a Chaos
Warrior, you kill them) you or blast your armour or weapon. They also can
give a *VERY* genereous combination reward. [see 'Chaos Warriors' below]

##03) Chaos Resistance no longer gives Confusion Resistance.

04) Critical hit calculations have been evened out a bit (melee goes x2, x3,
x4, x5, x6 to damage, with missiles doing x2, x3 and x4 damage, on a
critical hit). Weapon weight is figured at +50% for both the chance for and
the quality of a critical hit.

##05) A simple change: the *.spo files created by the wizard/debug mode
spoiler generation routines now appear in the ./lib/info directory instead
of in the ./lib/user directory. It's only significant in that the ./lib/info
directory needs to be present, so make sure that it is...

##06) Many will disagree, but I've removed the 10% 'sales tax' applied when
you have auto_haggle on. Haggling was a horrible feature in the first place,
so I fail to see why those who don't like it should be punished.

##07) Regeneration now only consumes 20 nutrition points, down from 30. As
usual, Slow Digestion will reduce that number by 10.

##08) Score and winner status now displayed in the character dump.

##09) Added an option to debug mode's play with object command to allow you
to choose 's'pecial (ie, random artifact) when re-rolling an item.

##10) Removed the display of the life rating during character creation. [I
find myself 'scumming' for a decent rating much of the time, and I assume
that it's the same for others - who wants a character when we *know* they're
only getting 85% of the hit points they normally would?]

##11) Being Berserk now gives +25 to hit and +10 to damage. In return, you
are reduced to just the base AC of worn armour and your Dexterity bonus,
minus a further 10 points. Spellcasting failure rates go up by 25% as well.

##12) Altered many of the included realm.prf files. If you used them, I
suggest that you look them over again so that you don't miscast spells...

##13) The display of skills on the character screen has been altered to
include the raw value of the score, in addition to a description of how good
that skill currently is. The descriptions are now, from worst to best:
Pathetic, Bad, Poor, Fair, Good, Great, Superb, Awesome, Heroic and Godly.
(I like the idea of being able to see just what the actual effects of an
increase in level or a change of equipment are on the skills)

##14) Unresisted cold damage now reduces the player's Dexterity (used to be
Strength). Unresisted fire damage now reduces the player's Charisma, as well
as their Strength.

##15) The maximum number of autoroller attempts has been reduced to 500000,
down from 1 million - if you can't get a decent character in that time, try
lower minimums. :)


              ####### Altered Races and Classes #######

Beastmen:
 In addition to the chance of gaining mutations as they increase in level,
   Beastmen now randomly gain a single mutation or lose a bunch of mutations
   (all of one of the three mutation classes, since that was easiest) every
   once in a while as they move around or rest...

Chaos Warriors:
 Gain bonus abilities based on their patron.
 Bonus melee attack at level 25, bonus missile shot at level 35.
 +1 to hit and to damage every 10 levels.
 If you have Arioch, Xiombarg or Mabelrode as a patron, and you kill them,
   then you will be hit with multiple TY Curses.

Draconians:
## Now gain the following resistances at the level in brackets: Fire (5),
   Cold (10), Acid (15), Electricity (20), Light (25), Dark (30),
   Poison (35). [done just to fill that big gap between electricity and
   poison]
## Draconian Rogues now breathe according to realm: Poison (Death), Nexus
   (Trump) or Confusion (Sorcery).

Elves:
 Racial activation is Detect Animals at level 10.

Gambolts:
 (see .\lib\help\birth.txt for the full details on this replacement for the
   Amberite race)
 Exceptional DEX & CHR (both sustained), Saving Throw and Stealth. Decent
   Searching and great Perception. All other stats and skills are average.
 Permanent speed +2.
 Hit Dice of 8, 60' infravision, and an XP penalty of +50% (which is open
   to negotiation).
 Racial activation is Charm Monster at level 20.
 Cannot 'legally' choose to be Priests, Paladins, Chaos Warriors or Monks.

Golems:
## XP required is at +125% (up from +100%).
 They have 13 hit dice (up from 12 HD).
 Magic Devices skill at +5 (up from -5).
## They now resist Fire (because of their 'birth' in a kiln or oven) and
   Shards, in addition to their original Poison resistance. (note: I've
   removed the Nexus resistance I added a few releases ago)
 They no longer get intrinsic See Invisible, Free Action or their level 35
   Hold Life, but keep their Slow Digestion.
## Intrinsic Armour Class has been changed to equal the Golem's level.

Half-Elves:
 Racial activation is Detect Animals at level 15.

Half-Trolls:
 All Half-Trolls, not just Warriors, get Slow Digestion with their level 15
   Regeneration.

High Magi:
## Now get a mana bonus of +50% instead of the normal +25%.
## XP Required is at +25% (down from +30%).
## Pseudo-ID speed is based on magical realm.

Humans:
 Racial activation is Self Knowledge at level 15.

Kobolds:
## Starts with STR -1, DEX +2 and CON +1. [instead of +1/+1/0]

Mindcrafters:
 XP required is at +30% (up from +25%).
 Various changes to their powers, noted in the Altered Spells section.

Monks:
 The 'Monk Hack' has been enabled, allowing the intrinsic speed of Monks to
   be cumulative with that of Klackons and Sprites.

Paladins:
 Bonus melee attack at level 25 and bonus missile shot at level 35.
 +1 to hit and to damage every 10 levels.

Priests:
 The penalty for using edged weapons (ie, Polearms, Axes or Swords) is now
   a *real* penalty of (-15,-15) instead of the (-2,-2) that no one ever
   really noticed.

Rangers:
 Bonus melee attack at level 25.
 Bonus shots with Short and Long Bows at levels 15, 30 and 45, instead of
   just at levels 20 and 40.
 +1 to hit and to damage every 10 levels.
 Nature magic only, no secondary realm.
 Begins with Short Bow instead of second spellbook.

Rogues:
 Rogues gain 1 XP for successfully searching out a secret door or trap with-
   out using a spell. Others gain nothing.
 Only Rogues gain XP for picking the locks on doors and chests.
 Other classes only get 1/2 of the normal XP gained for disarming traps.
## Backstabbing a monster requires that the Rogue be wielding a weapon that
   is 5 pounds or lighter, the Rogue pass a randint(monster_level+10) <=
   stealth check, and that the monster be somewhat humanoid.
## Backstabbing also affects monsters that are stunned or confused, in
   addition to those who are sleeping (ie, those that are helpless) or
   fleeing.
## Backstabbing a sleeping monster now does (5 + (plev/10)) times normal
   damage (ie, x5 to x10!) and stabbing a fleeing monster deals x3 normal
   damage (instead of the original x1.5). This is *REALLY* nasty with
   cumulative Slays and Brands, so I'll probably put in a limit somewhere.
## Rogues are the only class who increase in Stealth and Searching with
   level.

Skeletons:
 Begins the game at nightfall.

Spectres:
 Begins the game at nightfall.
 No longer gains telepathy at level 35.
 Has permanent light.
 Has Levitation.

Sprites:
 Sprites now gain their 'sleeping dust' activation at level 8.

Vampires:
 No longer start with scrolls of Light, and start with a higher number of
   scrolls of Darkness.
 Begins the game at nightfall.
## Takes damage from wielding *any* light source (either in the Light slot
   or as a weapon or armour) without having Resist Light.
 Gains Levitation at level 10.

Warriors:
## Warriors gain an AC bonus equal to %50 of worn body armour's base AC,
 rounded down.

Warrior-Magi:
 Bonus melee attacks at levels 25 and 50, bonus missile shot at level 35.
 6 blows with same weight and multiplier restrictions as Warriors.
 +1 to hit and to damage every 5 levels.
 Arcane magic only, no secondary realm.
 Begins with Hard Leather Armour instead of second spellbook.
## Available mana is at 75% what everyone else gets. (it's their own fault
   for spending so much time learning to fight :)
## XP required is at +35% (down from +50%).

Weaponmasters:
 (see .\lib\help\birth.txt for the full details on Weaponmasters)
 Weaponmasters are roughly equal to Warriors as far as stats and skills go.
 Weaponmasters have chosen for them, at birth, one of the four melee weapon
   types (Hafted (blunt), Polearms, Axes, or Swords) and start out with a
   fairly heavy (approximately 15 pounds) weapon of the proper type.
 Weaponmasters gain a bonus to-hit and to-dam equal to the player's level
   only when using a weapon of the type they specialize in.
 [thanks to GSN for the suggestion on how to keep this from affecting bows &
   throwing - I probably never would've spotted something so simple on my
   own :]
 Weaponmasters gain extra blows when wielding a weapon in their specialty
   class (extra blows at levels 15, 30 and 45), but never have more than one
   blow, regardless of Str & Dex and any magical considerations, when
   wielding other weapons.
 Gains Fear Resistance at level 35.
 No spellcasting.
 XP penalty of 30%.

Yeeks:
 Their 'scare monster' racial activation has been moved to level 5.
## Immunity to Acid now at level 30 (up from 20).

Zombies:
 Begins the game at nightfall.


              ####### Monster-Related Changes #######

 Bumped Sauron to level 97 and replaced Oberon, and the Serpent of Chaos
 with the three Sword Rulers (Arioch, Xiombarg and Mabelrode), all three of
 which must be now be defeated to win.

 Monsters with HURT_FIRE or HURT_COLD take +50% damage from those sources.

 Monsters with RES_CHAO take extra damage from weapons of Chaos (in the
 Eternal Champion setting, such weapons were created from Chaos to fight
 Chaos), but damage from Chaos breath, bolts and balls are reduced like any
 other resistance.

 New monster types: ELEMENTAL (most 'E' creatures and a few others) and
 SCUMDOG (the various GWAR uniques).

 New summoning types: S_HELLBLADES, S_ELEMENTAL, S_ANIMALS (as opposed to
 specific species such as Spiders and Hounds), S_SCUMDOG, S_DAWN.
 (Thanks to Eric Bock and Antimatter (of #angband) for helping me get the
 summonings working properly.)

 EXPLOSIVE flag added (monster blows up when killed - a formalization of the
 Unmaker's death effect).

## Due to what seem to be stack overflow problems, EXPLOSIVE monsters can no
 longer be generated in hordes or clone/symbol-clone nests.

 New monster blow methods: TONGUE (like a frog) and TENTACLE. No special
 effects for either, just flavour.

 New monster blow effect: RBE_VAMP. A creature that hits (or bites, or
 whatever) to 'VAMP' drains the player's XP and also heals a number of hit
 points equal to the XP drained in that attack. If the player has hold life
 and makes the saving throw, then the VAMP creature only heals an amount
 equal to the damage dealt in the attack. VAMP grants no healing if the
 player is a Golem or one of the Undead races, though it will still drain
 the experience points. (vampiric creatures need the life force of *living*
 creatures to heal themselves)

## Monsters can now cast Poison Bolts (BO_POIS). [the "#define RF5_BO_POIS"
 was already there, but the code blocks for it in melee2.c were empty, for
 some reason]

 The various object-mimics, monsters with a symbol of "<>$*,!=?|", are no
 longer detected as monsters with Detect Objects/Treasure, only as their
 object type.

## Bill Ferny is now EVIL instead of GOOD. :) Sorry 'bout that. And he and
 Brian Mulroney no longer have DROP_GREAT - it's an obsolete flag on those
 two with the Quick Start option I've implemented.

## Monsters normally generated in groups, with escorts, or who are breeders
 are no longer selected for random quests. [IMHO, they're usually far too
 wimpy individually to be fair challenges.]

## Undead monsters are no longer totally immune to Nether attacks. Instead,
 they resist at 1/9th normal damage (compared to 1/3rd for those who resist
 Nether and 1/2 for Evil creatures).

## Defined humanoid monsters as a monster with one of the following symbols:
 "hknNoOpPtTyY" - organs all in the right place [can't hamstring a naga, but
 otherwise fine], and not relying on magic for their existance, like Angels
 or the undead. 160 creatures total, as of this writing). Used for Slay
 Humanoid and the backstab attack of Rogues.

## Mithril (and the newer Adamantite) Golems now drop the appropriate coin
 type, just like the Creeping Coins do.

## If you feel righteous [ie, Bless/Prayer spells and scrolls], then your
 equipment won't become cursed from a monster's CAUSE_# or Hand of Doom
 spell attacks.

## The monster health bar has been updated to show if a monster is stunned
 (light brown) or confused (dark brown).


               ####### Object-Related Changes #######

## The Phial of Galadrial is now a level 2, rarity 2 item.

## The standard non-random artifacts can again be generated in the town.

## Brass Lanterns are less likely to show up in the General Store, are a bit
 more expensive when they do, and are level 5 items (were level 3 items).

## Fiddled with the recharge times for many artifacts and other items,
 especially those with bolt/ball attacks, to make them useful.

 Altered the amount of XP gained by Warriors (and Paladins) for destroying
 the dungeon spellbooks. They now gain ((book_cost / 50) * plev) for their
 efforts.

 Altered the Dexterity table governing the chance of having something stolen
 from your backpack. There is no more immunity: the table tops out at 98% at
 DEX:18/220 or higher.

 Chaotic weapons deal x2 damage to creatures who breathe chaos and those who
 resist chaos (RES_CHAO). [briefly, weapons of Chaos, in the earlier
 Moorcock stories, were created from Chaos by Law specifically to fight
 Chaos]

## Chaotic weapons have a reduced chance of causing earthquakes or causing
 your foe to vanish.

## Non-Chaotic weapons that cause earthquakes now only do so when the damage
 dealt is greater than 50 *and* randint(2)==1. If damage is less than 50, an
 earthquake can happen if randint(10)==1 [instead of randint(7)==1].

## Weapons of Westernesse (along with Sting, Glamdring, Orcrist, and
 Orchast) now activate to detect Orcs every 10 turns. (it'll have to do
 until limited ESP becomes a reality for Gumband)

## Armours of Spines now activate to shoot spines in a ball, centered on the
 player.

## Amulets are now vunerable to electricity.

## Amulets of Teleportation have become Amulets of Holding (an 80/4 item
 which sustains all stats and has a chance for Hold Life).

## Rings of Teleportation are no longer cursed. Instead, they are now a
 level 45 (rarity 6, cost 5000) item which activates for teleportation
 every 100 turns.

## Wielding a weapon with a Slay that conflicts with your race deals damage.
 Wearing heavy gloves (gauntlets or better - regardless of artifact or ego
 status) will prevent the damage. Yeeks and Gambolts are considered animals,
 by the way. Since Slay Humanoid doesn't affect undead or golem monsters,
 those races are also not scorced by such weapons. Slay Evil will harm just
 about everyone if I ever code up a morals system for players. :)

## Added a SLAY_ELEMENTAL flag, and weapons of Slay Elemental & *Slay*
 Elemental. One random low resistance is granted, up to two for the *Slay*
 version, which also boosts Dexterity. x3 base damage.

## Added a SLAY_HUMANOID flag. x3 base damage to humanoid creatures. Used
 *only* on the Long Sword 'Kanajana' (tho I might someday add an artifact
 dagger of some sort with the flag) and will never appear on random
 artifacts.

## Brands and Slays are now cumulative. First it's checked to see if the
 current multiplier is less than the brand/slay's original multiplier. If it
 is, the multiplier happens as normal. If the multpiler is greater than the
 brand/slay's original, then the multiplier is increased by 1. If a monster
 is immune to an element you have the brand for, then the multiplier is
 reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1, of course - don't want to multiply by 0).


                   ####### Spellcasting #######

 The biggest change of all to a spell effect: Invulnerability does *NOT*
 prevent all damage, nor does it have a chance of being penetrated. Instead,
 Invulnerability reduces *all* damage to 1/9th of normal (cumulative with
 resistances and such, if I'm reading things right). Hate me yet? :)

## Failure rates for spellcasting are adjusted as follows:
   Wearing gloves (without Free Action or a Dexterity bonus) for mage-type
      spellcasters (+25%) [no mana penalties]
   Being encumbered by heavy armour (+15%) [no mana penalties]
   Priests wielding a non-blessed edged weapon (+25%)
   Being Berserk (+25%)
   Being stunned (+15%/+25%)
   
## Characters suffering any of the conditions above can no longer get a 0%
 spell failure rate, no matter how high their spell-stat or level is.
 [failure rate below 0% is adjusted back up to 0% *before* penalties are
 assessed]

## The various branding spells can now be used on non-stacked items in the
 inventory and on the floor. Shopkeepers will *not* touch player-branded
 weapons, not including bolts branded with Cubragol.

Arcane:
## I've rewritten Arcane again. :) This time, only spells (with some minor
 alterations) from the first two spellbooks in the other realms are in
 Arcane - nothing that appears in the dungeon spellbooks, except for
 Restoration and Phlogiston (which stays in place - no Light Area spell!)
 The spell list now goes as follows:

 Cantrips for Beginners            Minor Arcana
 ======================            ============
 Static Bolt ('Zap', 13d4 max)     Resist Environment (as Nature's spell)
 Detect Monsters                   Sleep Monster
 Cure Light Wounds (3d8)           Stone to Mud
 Phase Door                        Lightning Bolt (20d8 max)
 Detect Doors/Traps                Recharging
 Phlogiston                        Magic Mapping
 Stinking Cloud                    Cure Medium Wounds
 Confuse Monster                   Identify

 Major Arcana                      Manual of Mastery
 ============                      =================
 Ray of Light                      Ball Lightning (125 max)
 Satisfy Hunger                    Healing
 Teleport Self                     Brand Weapon (randomly chosen brand)
 Remove Curse                      Summon Monster
 Cure Critical Wounds (12d8)       Poison Gas ('Stinking Cloud', 150 max)
 Teleport Other                    Teleport Level
 Haste Self                        Word of Recall
 Vampiric Drain                    Restoration

Chaos:
 'Mana Burst' now has a plev% chance of being a ball of *real* mana (GF_MANA
   instead of the normal GF_MISSILE).
 'Touch of Confusion' becomes 'Demon Detection'. Level, cost and fail are
   unchanged.
## 'Chaos Branding' moved to book 2, 'Teleport Other' moved to book 3.

Death:
## 'Wraithform' now lasts (randint(plev) + plev), making it useful. Wraith-
   form, whatever the source, no longer grants reflection, and only reduces
   damage to 1/3rd instead of 1/10th.
## 'Orb of Entropy' is now GF_HELL_FIRE damage instead of GF_OLD_DRAIN and
   is now named 'Infernal Orb'.
## 'Dispel Good' has been replaced by the original spell in its slot, 'Cloud
   Kill,' a poison ball dealing 100 + the player's level in damage.

Life:
## 'Remove Fear' has been replaced by 'Spiritual Hammer', an early bolt of
   Holy Fire, with the same level, cost and fail as 'Remove Fear'. It begins
   at 3d4 damage and tops out at 10d4.
## The various Cure Wounds spells now increase in power with the character's
   level.  Light tops out at 10d5, Medium at 10d10, and Critical at 15d10.
## 'Bless Weapon' has been changed to 'Summon Angel'. There is a 1-in-5
   chance of a hostile summoning. Costs and failure rates are unchanged.
   Scrolls of Bless Weapon (rarity of 75/4 & 100/2) has been added to
   compensate.
## 'Protection from Evil' now affects creatures of any level <= level 97,
   regardless of the character's level. Duration of the effect has been
   reduced. It is also less likely to successfully repel a monster (maximum
   40% chance to repel at character level 50). These mods apply regardless
   of the source of the PfE. (see melee1.c for full details) Scrolls of
   Protection from Evil are also a bit easier to get.
## 'Remove Curse' and 'Dispel Curse' now give you a message if a curse was
   actually removed.

Mindcraft:
 'Precognition' now detects doors and stairs at level 5, with detect traps
   bumped to level 10, and full detection moves to level 35, up from 30.
 'Minor Displacement' has moved its dimension door (targeted, short-ranged
   teleportation) effect to level 30 (from level 25).
 'Major Displacement' now gives Teleport Other at level 50 instead of its
   original 'Banish' (teleport away all creatures in line of sight) effect.
 'Psychometry' now gives Identify at level 30 and *Identify* at level 40.
 'Mind Wave' now becomes a line-of-sight effect at level 40 (up from 25).

Nature:
 'Detect Creatures' has become 'Animal Detection'.
 'Nature Awareness' also is reduced to detecting animals, but at player
   level 20 Elementals are detected as well.
## 'Cure Wounds/Poison' now also heals 6d8 damage.
## 'Elemental Branding' moved to book 2, 'Entangle' moved to book 4.

Sorcery:
 'Detect Objects/Treasure' and 'Detect Enchantment' have been moved to the
   first two books, with costs, levels and fail rates remaining about the
   same.
 'Detection True' has been moved to book 3 and dropped the 'True'.
 'Identify True' has been renamed 'Insight' and also moved to book 3.
## 'Stasis' (and, of course, all GF_STASIS effects) now affects uniques, as
 well as those creatures with NO_SLEEP. They still get a saving throw, tho.

Trump:
 'Reset Recall' becomes 'Minor Divination' which detects traps, doors,
   stairs and normal monsters, with the same levels, costs and failure rates
   as 'Reset Recall'.
## 'Trump Branding' moved to book 2, 'Banish' moved to book 3.


                  ####### Other People's Work #######

(NOTE: I might have missed one or two, but no biggie. :] Mail me if you spot
your own work so I can credit you properly...)

01) Kieron Dunbar's Stormbringer patch, to put Stormy in the a_info & k_info
text files instead of creating it on the fly.

02) Kieron's self-cursing items patch - items with the "AUTO_CURSE" flag
will curse themselves when worn, and after a few turns, when uncursed. The
type of curse [heavy or normal] depends on what other Cursed flags the item
has.

03) Removed Kieron's store-quantity patch. [the bug involved wasn't serious,
but it *was* annoying]

04) Added Prfnoff's '[Last Messages]' routine to the character dump so we
can all see what you died of. :)


                        ####### Bugs #######

01) There are too many potions in the game at the moment, so a few potions
cannot be generated via debug mode's item creation menus since the list runs
out of symbols fairly quickly. It is not a priority to fix.

02) I still can't figure out why "b) dismiss pets" is being displayed as
"b)         ", ie, blanked out...

03) If you look through the entire monster list ['/' then CTRL-a] while the
'know all monster info' cheat is active, you will see the occasional blank
monster (ie, The ('')/(''): [(r)ecall, ESC]). This is because there are
still empty slots in r_info.txt, which I will eventually fill.

04) Like with Chaos Patrons, when you go to a 'p'revious character, the
current Weaponmaster specialty remains, instead of restoring the older
character's specialty. If you then continue rolling, a new specialty will be
randomly chosen, of course. Not worth the effort to fix, IMHO.

05) For some reason Weaponmasters are *sometimes* being shown, only on the
'C'haracter screen, not in Self Knowledge, to gain Reflection at level 30.
Despite the display, the character does *not* actually have it. I can find
no reason for the display error or why it's only happening sometimes.

06) Sometimes, completely at random, the Roguelike option will set itself to
true upon startup. I have no idea why...

New combat rules for GW-Angband 2.8.3v2:
----------------------------------------

Player combat rules are significantly altered.  Instead of getting
a number of "blows per round" and a number of "shots per round", the
player has an energy cost associated with each blow or shot.  This number
is based primarily on DEX, but modified by class, experience level and
(for melee weapons only) the ratio of the player's STR over the weapon's
weight.

High-level characters may have per-blow energy costs which would give
them several blows per "normal" round.  In order to reduce tedium (and
keyboard wear-and-tear), a new option has been introduced: the maximum
desired blows per attack.  If this is set to a value greater than 1,
the character will attempt to take that many blows each time a monster is
attacked in melee.  (But the per-blow energy cost is also considered --
the character is not allowed to take more blows than the largest number
which will fit in a 100-energy round.)

Also, if the maximum desired blows per attack is set to a value greater
than 1, and a monster dies in melee before all the desired blows have
been used, the character will be charged only the energy cost of the
number of blows actually used to kill the monster.

    Example: a character has a per-blow energy cost of 30 and is attacking
    a monster.  If the maximum desired blows per attack is set to 2, then
    the character will swing 2 times (and will be charged 60 energy).

    However, if the monster dies on the first blow, then the character
    will only be charged 30 energy.
    
    If the same character sets the maximum desired blows per attack to 4,
    then the character will swing up to 3 times each time a monster is
    attacked (4 blows would require 120 energy, which is greater than 100
    and thus disallowed).
    
    If that character later gains enough power to lower the per-blow
    energy cost to 25, then the character could swing up to 4 times
    per attack.

By setting the maximum desired blows per attack to 0 (the default)
or 1, the character will only swing one time per attack (which gives
the maximum flexibility).  By setting it to 9, the character will act
similar to a normal Angband character, always taking as many blows as
possible each time an attack is made.  However, even with the maximum
desired blows per attack set to 9, the character still has one benefit
over her Angband counterpart -- unused blows will not count against her.
(This benefit is identical to that of the high-level Oangband 0.3.2
Warrior, except that it applies to all characters regardless of class
or level.)

In certain situations the character may gain additional benefit by setting
the maximum desired blows per attack to a high value.  Consider monsters
which are faster than the character, but who have low hit points.
If the character takes one swing against the monster, it may miss, or
not do enough damage to hit; but multiple swings may kill the monster.
By taking several swings at once, the character may avoid letting the
monster attack in between the character's blows.  This benefit must be
weighed against the flexibility gained by taking single swings.

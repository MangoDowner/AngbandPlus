Many people should be thanked and I cannot remember you
all.  But I've tried to maintain a list.

- #angband on IRC with it's many inhabitants.  Many of them
  know the angband sources well and have patiently answered
  many of my questions.

- all those who have tested and reported bugs, problems and
  improvements for langband.

- Knut A. Erstad for showing a workable way out of the DLL-hell on
  Windows.  Karl Trygve Kalleberg for helping me get sound working
  with SDL. 

- Greg Velichansky for doing the first port of angband to SDL which
  was the basis I started with.  It has changed a lot, but his work is
  still essential. 

- Kevin Rosenberg for being invaluable aid in improving
  debian-packaging and getting langband into debian main.  

- Andreas Fuchs for providing a patch that allows players to use
  roguelike keyset.  See faq.html on how to enable.

- Scott Holder for adding numeric-ids to all my monsters when I needed
  them and out of stupidity had forgotten to include them for backward
  compatibility to vanilla angband.  Lots of ugly grunt-work that
  needed doing.
 
- Most of the tiles in graphics/tiles have been made by David E
  Gervais. (dg_*.bmp to be specific)

- The splendid character portraits (graphics/people/*.png) have been
  made by Claudio Pozas and you can find more of his work at:
  http://www.d20reviews.com/pozas

  A special permission to use them with Langband has been given. If
  you plan to use them for other purposes, please ask the artist.

- The crosshair png was originally made by Eldritch on #angband.

- The summer.png tiles are borrowed from Freecraft fcmp, and are
  covered by GPL (like Langband). 

- The "Death-picture" is a detail from the Tomb of Louis de France in
  the Abbey Church in Saint-Denis.  The artwork was made in 1260.

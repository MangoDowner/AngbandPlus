[Version 0.6.5a](https://dgolddragon28.github.io/Unangband/2017/06/26/Version065a.html)
==============================

Unangband 0.6.5a is out! Download the source or binary of the new release [here](https://github.com/DGoldDragon28/Unangband/releases/tag/v.0.6.5a).

Among several bugfixes to improve the experience, I have also created a native Mac OS X (Cocoa) port of the game
(mostly by ripping code for the port from [Vanilla](https://github.com/angband/angband) ). The Cocoa GUI has not
been extensively tested with Unangband, and therefore there may be bugs. The linux (curses/x11) version is to be
considered more stable, and can still be run on OS X. In addition, graphics tiles and sounds are non-functional
(and therefore not included) in the OS X version.

Please report any bugs with the game at the issue tracker. A shout-out to @aeoo for finding many of the bugs that
this release fixed, and others who posted issues as well.

I will likely do one or two more bugfix releases before the quest update (0.7.0).

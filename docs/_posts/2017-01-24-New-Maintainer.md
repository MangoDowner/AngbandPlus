[New Maintainer; New Repository](https://dgolddragon28.github.io/Unangband/2017/01/24/New-Maintainer.html)
==============================

On October 18, 2016, I was given maintainership of Unangband by Andrew Doull, the creator and long-time maintainer
of the roguelike variant. Today, as the first release since the switch (0.6.5) approaches, I have taken the (small
amount of) time to set up this site in order to be able to facilitate better communication and a front for the variant.

Andrew Doull's old Unangband blog (and his releases) can be found at [http://unangband.blogspot.com/](http://unangband.blogspot.com/).

Anyone who wishes to help in the further development of this game is more than welcome to contribute: either fork this
repository and submit pull requests or contact me [directly](mailto:dgolddragon28@gmail.com).

[Continuing Delay](https://dgolddragon28.github.io/Unangband/2017/04/18/Continuing-Delay.html)
==============================

As stated in my previous post, I do not expect to get a new release out until June or July.
However, I realized that I left slight ambiguities. To any who are worried by the lack of
commits lately, I have been bogged down with other work and do not expect to have much time
to work on this until late May. This doesn't preclude any of you from submitting pull
requests or issues during that time, though, and I will deal with them as I am able.

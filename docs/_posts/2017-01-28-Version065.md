==============================

Unangband 0.6.5 is out! Download the source or binary of the new release [here](https://github.com/DGoldDragon28/Unangband/releases/tag/v.0.6.5).

Major changes:

-Reworked maps so that they don't provide senseless teleportation halfway across Arda; each map may now have a 'from' dungeon specified, and attempts to use the map from any other dungeon (if the 'from' is defined) fail.

-Made some artifacts always appear in certain 'reward shops' (e.g. the Phial of Galadriel is attained at her Mirror).

-Allies in battlefield levels now vary based on the 'A:' entry for that dungeon

-Encumbrance reduces energy as opposed to speed.

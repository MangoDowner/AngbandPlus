<h1>Changelog v0.1.4 (Engine)</h1>
<pre>
2003-02-18  Stig E Sandø &lt;stig@users.sourceforge.net&gt;
	* Mostly updated the engine to accomodate contraband needs, most
	of which are not relevant to the vanilla game.  Most work has also
	been on contraband.
	* Split up and cleaned some of the birth-query code
	* Started to use produce/init protocol for classes, races and
	monsters
	* Removed most skill-related code from the engine.
	* Added 'R'est command
	* Added rudimentary disturb code to stop resting and running
	* Removed mana constants from engine
	* Hopefully improved the DRAW-TO-MAP function to be a bit faster
	* Tweaked game-loading
	* Reorganised debian-packaging to put the data/ directory in a
	langband-data/ package.  The new data/ directory has constant
	binary data now.
	* Added support for 1024x768 and 1280x1024 resolution.
	* Experimental change to avoid callbacks to lisp-code.. all is run
	from lisp now.
	* Updated a lot of the print.lisp code and even fixed a bug or two
	* Now support inline calculations in theme.lisp
	* Added OpenAL support.. still some sound-problems though.
	* Several minor bugfixes and internal code improvements.

<h1>Changelog v0.1.5 (Engine)</h1>
<pre>
2003-03-09  Stig E Sandø &lt;stig@users.sourceforge.net&gt;
	* Added FFI-definitions for OpenMCL (very unstable and not
	recommended for people not familiar with lisp)
	* Added GCU/Curses support back into zterm.  The code seems to
	work but has not been extensively tested.
	* added preference files for user in ~user/.angband/langband where
	user can control various game-settings, including the use of
	roguelike keys.
	* roguelike keyset hook added to engine, and actual keys added to
	vanilla variant by Andreas Fuchs 
	* added 'D'estroy item command to engine
	* tweaked sound-code to use string identifiers independent of
	engine constants.
	* added code to 't'hrow items to engine
	* unified the allocation code (objects, monsters, ..) to one
	common function 
	* made character-class init two-step instead of the old one-step.
	this allows overriding in variant
	* moved much of the death-code to vanilla as it was fairly
	vanilla-specific
	* fixed some pesky details in dungeon drawing
	* made an upper-bound to piles when stacking (99)
	* improved saving/loading of player and variant object to be
	controlled by the variant instead of engine.
	* added no-cons FORMAT that writes directly to a window instead of
	making a temporary string.  Mostly useful for simple code.
	* added some hooks for monster- and object-knowledge
	* added handy functions to apply effects to circles and
	rectangular areas of the dungeon.. useful for e.g spells
	* fixed several issues relating to stores, store-maintenance and
	activation. 
	* rearranged dialogue/conversation code to be put in an
	engine-module that a variant may choose to load.
	* other minor fixes and tweaks.

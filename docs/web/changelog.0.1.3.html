<h1>Changelog v0.1.3 (Engine)</h1>
<pre>
2003-01-18  Stig E Sandø &lt;stig@users.sourceforge.net&gt;
	* Ripped out the zterm backend in C with all the Term_* functions
	and wrappers and replaced it with window.lisp and some helpers in
	global.lisp.  The new system uses multilayer graphics, is in lisp,
	has no questionable license, is less than one tenth in codesize
	and seems to work well.  Some issues and slowdowns may appear and
	should be reported so they can be fixed.  This has affected
	zterm/*.c and zterm/*.h and many places in the lisp-code that used
	the old functions.  Bugs may still be frequent in untested parts
	of the code.
	* Disabled GCU in this release, if it is requested it will be
	included in future releases.
	* Tweaked targeting and added crosshair cursor.  Also allows
	targeting with right mouse-button.
	* Fixed the game-loop to use a priority-queue based on monster
	energy instead of the complicated old system.
	* Removed much of the ffi aparatus for strings, as it isn't needed
	anymore.  The code now does not rely on string-passing over FFI in
	the inner loop.
	* Renaming of many functions, esp those with C- prefix, due to the
	drastic changes in the FFI-related code.
	* Replaced the x-attr/x-char and text-attr/text-char system in the
	active code with GFX-SYM and TEXT-SYM which are precalculated
	integers specifying the graphics/ascii to use.  Declarative
	structures can still use x-attr/... but active code will only use
	gfx-sym and text-sym in the future.
	* Improved handling of visual effects for missiles and spells.
	Need more tweaking and is unstable.  Similar changes will happen
	to sound-effects as well.
	* Improved the code considerably to do input-events with more
	ease.  Only supports mouse-events and keyclicks, but this is
	handled in a much more transparent way now.
	* Improved missile-shooting and missile damage code
	* Removed MAP-INFO and instead added DRAW-TO-MAP which uses
	multilayer graphics.
	* Improved mouse-handling which now has a separate generic and it
	is calculated which subwindow is clicked before a variant will
	handle a click.
	* Improved keyboard handling with support for shift/alt/ctrl keys
	and direct specifications of these in key triggers
	* Several other minor changes
</pre>

<h1>Changelog v0.1.3 (Vanilla)</h1>
<pre>
2003-01-18  Stig E Sandø &lt;stig@users.sourceforge.net&gt;
	* Updated code to fit large changes in engine, see engine
	changelog.
	* Added visual effects for spells and missiles
	* Added control of images to the variant, and this control is no
	longer on the C-side.
	* Reorganised some key-info to use config/ to make it easier to
	tweak
	* Added possibility of describing spells directly in the book
	definition
	* Fixed several spell-issues, and now displays study-status for
	spells.
	* Updated most monsters, objects, flavours, etc with x-attr/x-char
	info with graphics directly instead of relying on graf-prefs.lisp
	updates.  Easier to read and understand now.
	* Other minor fixes.

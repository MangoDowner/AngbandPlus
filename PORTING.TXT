DrAngband 2.9.2+ 50-line mode
-----------------------------

This textfile gives a quick guide to enabling 50-line mode
in ports of DrAngband. Here is how it should be done:

1. Prior to the execution of init_xxx() (in the relevent
main-xxx.c file) a global variable, screen_y will be
set to either 25 (for default 80*25 mode) or some other
value like 50 (for 80*50).

2. When setting the screen mode if:
   screen_y = 25: Default mode requested. Set the screen
   to 80*25.

   screen_y > 25: Large screen requested. The actual size
   requested does not have to be given, as long as screen_y
   is updated to reflect the new setting (this is VERY
   important). It works fine with anything from 25 - 68.
   68+ and the full dungeon map is displayed vertically on
   one screen.

3. That's all! Main.c will calculate screen geometry for the
   given mode and everything will run nicely :-)

4. Oh yeah, test big screen mode with: angband -y
   Or "angband -yXX" for any screen of >= 25.
   Eg. "angband -y43" for a 43 line display.

Versions currently supporting big screens:

DOS,
OS/2,
Unix/Curses (GCU)
Unix/X11.

NOTE: As of version 2.9.4, screen_x may also be greater than
normal. Only the X11 and GCU port supports this at the moment.
(Set with -x switch).

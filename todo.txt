--> Improv's Suggestions
 - Sound attacks should have a chance to knock weapons out of the user's
   hand if they don't resist it
 - Chaos should import chaos effects from Z (mutate race, reduce stats, etc)
 - Maybe mana attacks should be able to blast armor or weapons (very rarely,
   only if player doesn't resist)
 - Monks need reworking of their combat system so they don't suck anymore.
 - Posessor 'spell' success rate formula needs reworking

--> takkaria's "remember to do this" list
 - Port security changes from vanilla's CVS.
 - Maybe change the contextual help to use roff() instead of messages.
 - '?' at the "look" prompt for a feature should bring up help on that feature.
   (maybe for monsters too)
 - attempt to come up with a skills screen that doesn't hurt my eyes
 - rename roff() to text_out() so it makes more sense.

--> To watch
 - number of class/race/realms/subrace if > 64 will overflow the
   liked/hated_class in st_info arrays and lots of arrays in the structs
 - number of k_idx > 10000 will overflow the store hack (TV:256)
 - number of flag groups > 32 will overflow things

--> Urgent

--> Urgent bugs
 - character running on a know trap should stop BEFORE triggering it

--> BEFORE RELEASE

TODO
star_identify doesn't react well to stacks of items - it goes on and on about
'this item'.

you see a rubble when 'l'ooking.

add some more hooks to do (in the dump) a loop that goes from 1 to the current
turn and metions:

killed uniques
killed monsters for the first time
found artifacts
levels gained
found vaults
deaths

etc. Most of it is in place, except for the levels.

There's still an obscure bug in store.c somewhere. It's triggerable by setting
okay = FALSE right after feeling = 0 when generating a town level. The game
will then keep on generating new town levels, and somewhere, it crashes
in store.c: store_carry(). Memory is being corrupted somewhere. st_ptr points
to nirvana, and SIGSEGV results :-(. This has probably been solved by
substituting store[which]. for every st_ptr-> there, but I still don't know
why?

there's no difference between the mage spells genocide I and genocide II.

should potions of sleep induce sleep in monsters when thrown?
Ditto confusion, fire, poison etc? Experience anyone?

it's not possible to 'l'ook at a known trapped chest and then remember
anything about the trap on it.....

it's possible for monster groups that should be created in vaults to extend
outside the vault.

priests shouldn't carry cursed items...

prevent traps from disintegrating with rogues - ask for it.
Make them portable?

place traps next to intelligent monsters in the dungeon?

remake the trap of silent switching so that switching a lantern with 6 torches
results in one torch wielded, and 5 torches + a lantern in the inventory.

add all descriptions in a_info.txt. Difficult, because some names don't exist
in Tolkien (Carlammas anyone?)

make monsters able to build walls, like a scared Xorn or Umber Hulk?
Also neat for ghosts...

Make more types of ghosts (ghosts, liches, vampires, undead beholders, etc?)

Perhaps an helmet of light should be +1 to +3 to light

print messages "flees in terror" only when a monster actually flees.

add light-bearing to monsters - light hounds, orcs with torches, etc.

decide if detect traps should detect multiple traps all at once, or not.
For the moment, it does.

more different ego-weapons

monster inventories
Give monsters things like hands (1-4), flags for can wear armour + max level
or perhaps go the ADOM way: integrate the player and monster types, making
monsters able to gain experience etc.

make monster wake-up chance dependant on light radius = intensity

eatable mosses (and uneatable, poisonous) etc to be scraped off dungeon walls

food in the wilderness

you see all of the some pieces of pearl sink in the lava.

=== PosBand version history ===

Version 0.9.9 **-***-** Alexander Ulyanov <posband@earthsea.org>

	New features:

	* Invisibility. Invisibility != high stealth; it doesn't
	  prevent monsters from waking up, but makes their melee
	  and ranged attacks very random. Some monsters (including
	  spiritual beings and those who don't use eyes to see), and
	  high-level uniques are unaffected by invisibility. Invisibility
	  is innate to some races, and is granted by some items and
	  artifacts; some spells/items may grant temporary invisibility.
	  Invisibility effect can also be achieved by standing in
	  fog, and (much weaker) in water or fire.
	* As a consequence, monsters can be blinded now. (Perhaps make
	  light/darkness blind them, too? Would be nice to make ?oDarkness
	  useful.)
	* All monsters are now invisible in fog.  Elementals and vortices
	  are invisible in their native terrain.  You can't see through this
	  kind of invisibility.
	* Slots are not hard-coded any longer. Creatures with e.g. 20
	  bodies are possible now -- the only limit is total 23
	  equipment slots (to fit on the screen).
	* Multiple weapons/bows wielding is possible now!
	* Possessing a human (e.g. Novice rogue, Swordsman, Patriarch)
	  will now give you all the abilities of his class. 
	* Fighting/Shooting skills split to Barehanded, Edged weapons,
	  Hafted weapons, Polearms, Axes, Slings, Bows, Crossbows, Throwing.
	* *Identify* service now available in the Guild (costs 4000gp).
	* Experienced monsters now regenerate faster.
	* Abyss grids are more dangerous now. By stepping on it without
	  levitation, you will fall ~7-10 levels down, causing up to 40d8
	  damage.  (No, you cannot fly past levels 99 or 100 that way.)
	* Some new "exotic" base item types (Swords of Balrog, Poisoned
	  Darts, etc.).
	* Dark Elves now start game with a stack of poisoned darts
	  (many players reported difficulties in early game, before the
	  "specialisation" choice)
	* Player gets full monster memory information for his own body.
	* It is possible now to invoke help from new form selection screen.
	* New splash screen (yes, again -- old one was rather silly).
	  Splash screen and tombstone now have color.
	* Linux binary packages for Red Hat and Slackware.
	* Ported autoconf scripts from Vanilla (heavily modified).
	* Savefiles are now compressed with zlib (if it is available).
	* Character notes are now stored in the savefile itself.
	* Starburst rooms, new pit types from NPPAngband 0.4.0.
	* Maybe other minor changes.

	Front-end changes:

	* Added "lfb" (Linux framebuffer).
	* Removed "ami", "cap", "dos", "emx", "gtk", "ibm", "sla",
	  "vme", "x11" and "xpj".  "ros", "crb" and "mac" are unmaintained
	  at the moment -- I may try to rework the display system in the
	  future. Minor changes to "gcu", "vcs" and "xaw" front-ends.

	New races: <...>

	Bugfixes:

	* 'C' screen (barely) squeezed on 80x24 terminal.
	  The game should now work properly with small terminals
	  again. Character dump is also fixed. Note that 'C' screen
	  is now 6 pages long :).
	* Reforging or randart generation could crash PosBand in
	  randart-only games.
	* Skills were calculated incorrectly for all monster/possessor
	  races. Ugh!
	* "gcu" front-end has correctly working pseudo-graphics now.
	  Well, in theory at least :) Code from Vanilla 3.0.5.
	* Acid/disenchanment couldn't affect items in some slots.
	* Randarts which activate for illumination every turn were
	  sometimes generated.
	* Tailored rewards fixed. Should now work as expected (that is,
	  give you Really Neat Items Which You Actually Need).
	* Randarts' price is now equal to the price of template artifact.
	  Rather crude decision, but selling randarts for ridiculously
	  low prices made the Guild trying to replace all your randarts
	  with the standard artifacts, whether they were actually better or
	  not.
	* "Heal Pet" power worked only on neutral-aligned pets.
	* The game could try to reward a monster race with a
	  spellbook; since monster races have no spellbook, the game
	  would fallback on random reward.
	* Ice and rock squares were nearly invisible.  Changed
	  ice to while ` (admittedly not the best solution), and
	  rocks to dark gray :.
	* Reforged light sources could be refilled -> pval +15000.
	* Rods of Perception could be used without recharging.
	* "Decayed" levels removed. They looked ugly, and were not
	  particularly playable.
	* All monsters in pit/nest will have the same alignment now,
	  preventing immediate spectacular combats between pit inhabitants
	  (you could wait until most of monsters are killed, teleport or
	  banish the rest, and collect *tons* of loot)
	* Descriptions of posions of resist acid/electricity/poison
	  incorrectly referred to fire resistance.
	* Removed help file manual.txt. Extremely out of date.
	* MICoMorgoth pval reduced to +50, which is for all practical
	  purposes equal to +125. 18/1000+ stats wouldn't fit properly.
	* Monster-monster nether bolt attack affected player.
	* Monster recall now lists monsters by level by default.  Can't
	  imagine why player might be interested in the order of
	  monsters in monster.txt (that was the default behavior).
	* Narya/Nenya/Vilya/One activation damage increased to plasma/360,
	  water/600, storm/750 and mana/1500-3000.
	* Monsters cannot lash with a whip or throw boulders when in webs. 
	* Potion of Resistance actually granted only temporary acid
	  resist.
	* Randard DSMs had no activation.
	* Some randart objects that would be squelched couldn't be picked
	  up.
	* Tomb screen didn't show monster race.
	* Some other typos and minor bugs fixed.
	* Help updates.
	* Some bugfixes from NPPAngband 0.4.0.
	* Massive code cleanup. Many source files renamed or splitted.
	  Removed unused things; removed things that are needed to
	  support ancient systems. Honestly, I don't care much about
	  DOS.
	  

Version 0.3.0-alpha2 10-Oct-04 Alexander Ulyanov <uav@urmail.ru>

	New features:

	* Unique corpses can now be sold at the Adventurers Guild.
	* Added option "Turn off quick messages on low HPs"
	  (low_hp_careful).

	New races:

	* Hydra

	Bugfixes:

	* The game hanged at birth if the cursed item was accidentally
	  generated.
	* Monsters who past walls could push past monster standing next
	  to wall, causing it to be pushed in wall.
	* font-x11.prf split to two files. If walls and floors don't
	  appear properly in X11, just delete feat-x11.prf file.
	* File randart.txt moved from lib/edit to lib/file directory.
	  Files in lib/edit are pre-parsed to binary lib/data files so
	  they can be removed. randart.txt is parsed on the fly, and
	  therefore does not really belong to lib/edit directory.
	* Slightly redesigned Adventurers Guild interface.
	* Boots of Slow Descent renamed to Boots of Levitation.
	  Items of Wizardry base depth increased to 30. Boots of Wizardry
	  max pval lowered.
	* Morgoth got some resistance holes.
	* Outer permanent walls were not displayed (unless you bumped into
	  them, or quaffed potion of enlightemnent)


Version 0.3.0-alpha1 02-Oct-04 Alexander Ulyanov <uav@urmail.ru>

	New features:

	* New terrain system.
	  There are now four kinds of elemental terrains, each one
	  consists of two varieties: water/ice, fire/lava, fog/abyss,
	  sand/rocks...
 	* New themed levels (forest, volcano, rivers etc.)
	  NOTE! These are *off* by default. Set the option
	  "birth_themed_levels" to "yes" if you want themed levels.
	* Water elementals can now heal with potions of water (heals
	  1/6 max hps). Also, fire now blinds w/elems for 2 turns
	  (unresistably).
	* Three new demons (Familiar, Torturer, Ice demon) to fill
	  the gap between quasits and bodaks, for Demonic Qs.
	* Flasks of oil, torches, lanterns, food (any), arrows,
	  scrolls of Word of Recall are now always generated in stores.
	* New artifacts and ego-items by Ceilti OCahill.
	* New option "no_race_char" -- makes the player always show as
	  "@", regardless of race.
	* Major changes of non-unique Ainur.
	* Added the Valar -- for the fun of it! They are always friendly and
	  extremely powerful. They can attack uniques, unlike pets. They
	  cannot be normally met; you can summon a Vala either by activating
	  the Silmaril (new artifact -- with the same rarity as the One
	  Ring). They disappear after 100 turns (they can be re-summoned
	  after that).
	* New randart generator by Chris Carr and Chris Robertson.
	* Added some OAngband vaults.
	* Finished LAWFUL/CHAOTIC definition.
	* Starting equpment is now race-specific.
	* Neither monster nor player receive any extra experience for
	  killing experienced monster.
	* Redesigned web site.

	New races:

	* Ainu
	* Fire Elementals

	Bugfixes:

	* A long awaited fix of breeder problem. Now they simply freeze
	  when you're outside their scanning range -- just like the
	  old times :). Also, breeders can now attack each other when
	  bored.
	* Pets don't use teleportation and saving-throw spells by
	  default.
	* Group pet summons are now much smaller.
	* Quest monsters could evolve!
	* Age is now 16-bit, so that the age is more appropriate for
	  the Ainur.
	* Very stupid bug -- draconic quylthilgs evolved to greater
	  _demonic_ quylthulgs. Time to go to sleep :-/.
	* Player could evolve into strange monsters by pressing shift+key
	  at new race selection screen.
	* Pets no loger pick up items.
	* Pets no longer drop treasure when killed.
	* Monster casting an orb of draining on another monster was
	  automatically hasted.
	* Fixed an old bug -- elemental rings had no activation description.
	Thanks to Polarhound and Netbrian for useful feedback!

	Internal improvements:

	* Code cleanup.
	* Body powers code is generated now from a single source
	  (which is preprocessed with GNU M4 macro processor in
	  several include files). This makes adding new powers easier
	  and faster.
	* Added a simple makefile in the root directory.
	* Some hacks removed.
	* Some other hacks introduced :).

Version 0.2.0-alpha3 26-Jul-04 uav <uav@urmail.ru>

	New features:

	* New races: Shadow Dragon, Skeleton
	* Monsters no longer receive items, which they cannot wear, as quest
	  rewards (neither as great, nor as tailored rewards)
	* When a monster sleeps, confuses or scares another monster
	  successfully, it tries to choose different target for itself,
	  as his former target is temporarily unable to fight. Especially
	  makes sense with sleep (monster could sleep another monster,
	  then attack and awake him at once).
	* New pet control menu item: 'Set enabled spells'.
		Allows to set spells which you want
		your pets to use. There are six groups: innate ranged
		attacks (various missiles and breathes, do not use mana),
		offensive spells (various bolts and balls, use mana),
		teleportation spells, spells with a saving throw (scare,
		confuse, paralyze etc. etc.), summoning spells and mass
		summoning spells. Typically you want to turn off
		teleportation spells to avoid stupid teleports, blinks
		on the other side of walls etc. Turning off spells with
		a saving throw also makes sense at depths >1500ft, since
		most monsters completely resist them, and those who don't
		have good saving throws anyway.
	* New news.txt file. No fancy ascii-art, but more vivid and
	  informational
	* Monster race spoiler data are now automatically generated with
	  Python script. As a result, monster race spoiler will be now
	  always accurate and up-to-date.
	* NOTE! Web site moved to "http://orthanc.chat.ru/pos/"

	Bugfixes:

	* Bugfix: Chaos Dragon's exp penalty was 350%, causing byte overflow
	  to ~95%. Changed to 200%.
	* Bugfix: "Failed a quest to kill 0 <player>"
	* Bugfix: Screenshots were created with "NPPAngband" generator field.
	  (Thanks to Jeff Greene for pointing this)
	* Bugfix: main-ros.c contained references to NPP -- anyone dares to
	  compile Pos for RISC OS?
	* Bugfix: "Create darkness" monster spell always created darkness
	  near player.
	* Bugfix: When pets killed monsters, experience fractions were not
	  taken into account, leading to 0 exp for pet kills worth less than
	  10 exp (2 exp for Qs). (Reported by Hugo Kornelis)
	* Bugfix: The message "You sense the presence of the greatest ...
	  alive" was sometimes issued even without actual king unique
	  being generated
	* Bugfix: Rings with +0 to searching etc. were possible
	* Bugfix: Player's height and weight are now 16-bit values,
          so no more 50lb giants
	* Exp cost of The Guardian of Chaos lowered -- he was worth more
	  that Morgoth! Although he is certainly tough :)
	* SP are not displayed now if the player has no powers
	* Monsters can now teleport away each other
	Thanks to Polarhound for reporting many bugs.

Version 0.2.0-alpha2 08-Jun-04 uav <uav@urmail.ru>

	New races:
		- Dark Elf. A typical humanoid races. Starts without
		  much specialization; has confuse, MM (expensive) and
		  detect chaos. At cl15, though, he must choose between
		  Dark elven warrior, Dark elven mage or Dark elven
		  priest.

		  Dark elven warrior has special attacks: 
		  powerful attack with +10 to-hit and +(plev*2/3) to-dam,
		  far reaching attack with polearm, allowing to hit monster
		  one grid far (like in ToME), whirlwind attack, allowing
		  to hit everything nearby. All attacks are available as
		  powers; power stats is STR. Gets "examine object" power,
		  which instantly pseudo-ids object, at cl30. Becomes
		  a dark elven lord at cl35, with elemental bolt spells
		  (like real Dark elven lords), heroism, berserk and haste.

		  Dark elven mage (Dark elven sorceror at cl35) is a typical
		  spellcaster. Gets MM, blink, stinking cloud, frost/fire
		  bolt, teleport, detect monsters, identify, teleport away,
		  summon elementals, detection, frost/fire ball, resistance,
		  acid bolt, ice bolt, summon demon, recall, dark storm, ice
		  storm, word of destruction and dimensional door. Powers
		  stat is INT.

		  Dark elven priest (Dark elven druid at cl35) gets
		  three "curse" spells ("You point at it and curse";
		  pure damage, resisted by nobody, but monsters get a saving
		  throw and damage doesn't increase with level; if the
		  monster is killed with this spell, he is considered to
		  be "sacrificed", and consumed by a ball spell with
		  significant damage), darkness ball, summon spiders,
		  healing, death orb, blink, summon undead, *healing*,
		  detection, restoration, remembrance and summon greater
		  undeads. Powers stat is WIS. As you see, this is
		  actually necromancer-like form (or "dark priest", if you
		  like).

		  All dark elves start with RDark, get RPois at cl15
		  (first evolution) and one more resist at cl35 (second
		  evolution).

		- White Dragon. Much like Red Dragon. Very wise, good
		  stealth and saving throw. Unique feature is "breathe
		  freezing": Non-uniques have 1/30 chance of instakill
		  (freezing solid and shattering); Reptiles (including
		  hydras, nagas and dragons) and insects of any kind have
		  their metabolism slowed, resulting in -(5+d5) speed, up to
		  -40, and take full damage regardless of their cold
		  resistance; All other creatures take standard cold damage.

	New features:

	* Corpses generation can be disabled now (in squelch menus)
	* Stone-to-mud wands are now sold in General store (no_wield
		monster races suck at digging)
	* Added "difficulty" field to monster race selection screen

	Bugfixes:

	* Bugfix: inventory slot disappearing after reforging service
	* Bugfix: souls are now better with magic devices, so that player
	  doesn't get bored trying to activate wand of MM
	* Bugfix: equipment "matrix" was a bit mangled in chardump
	* Bugfix: quest monsters could be polymorphed. Not sure whether this
	  is actually bad (JG is opposed to idea of "protecting" quest
	  monsters in any special way)
	* Bugfix: pets killing uniques (for Q's only) were handled
	  incorrectly. Also, uniques couldn't be killed by pets via
	  ranged attacks
	* Bugfix: RF5_BOLT_NETHR spell issued messages "It cast a nether
	  bolt at you." in monster-vs-monster combat.
	* Bugfix: 'command pets' command had no key in roguelike keyset
	  ('[' -- all the best keys are already reserved...)
	* Bugfix: regular priest's bless prayer worked indefinitely long
	* Red dragons no longer get INT/WIS/CHR sustain at cl45
	* Blue yeeks base level changed to 1, so that Qs can actually
	  summon anything at dlvl1
	* 'I'nspecting weapons no longer issues "It gives you N attacks..."
	  message if player's body has no weapon slot
	* GChromWSM now has all basic immunities
	* Spider progression modified: tarantulas were worse that giant
	  spiders. Changed melee attacks, base level and xp/kill for
	  giant spiders, giant tarantulas, araneas and elder araneas
	* Pets levelup is now 2.5 times slower
	* Fixed/partially rewritten racial histories
	* Source cleanup. Now it compiles without horrible warnings


Version 0.2.0-alpha1 20-May-04 uav <uav@urmail.ru>

	New features:

	* Added possession in basic form. The first monster race is now
	  'Soul', which also has special class 'Possessor'. Soul starts with
	  no equipment slots, no attacks, hit die 1, no powers (it has
	  SEE_INVIS and PASS_WALL, though). It is given a wand of magic
	  missile so that you can kill some townsmen and find a humanoid
	  corpse for you. Monsters have 35% chance of dropping corpse (or other
	  'remains') after death, 65% for possessors. By pressing 'N' you
	  can incarnate into any corpse and use its powers just like monster
	  race; note, though, that possessed corpse will not grow. By
	  pressing 'N' while possessing a corpse you can leave it and become
	  a soul again... note however that soul is very vulnerable and you
	  should leave a corpse only in safety; also, when you leave a
	  corpse, it decays!
	* Added pets, companions, monster experience, level-up and
	  evolution. Needs testing.
	* Added some items to make pets (Scrolls/Staves of Summon Pet,
	  Wands of Charming).
	* Added monster companion (from dl10-15) to some normal races.
	  Funny, though probably owerpowered.
	* Added "king" monsters for monster races. "Kigns" are uniques with
	  your race (e.g. Lich -> Vecna, Red Dragon -> Glaurung, Water
	  Spirit -> Waldern). You get 3x exp, permanent blessing and heroism
	  and a special artifact for killing king. If there is an artifact
	  associated with a unique, it can be retrieved by any character
	  but only with 1/15 probability.
	* Added few new monsters (more water elementals to summon, uniques
	  for some races).
	* Added some new monster flags (e.g. summon water elementals).
	* Added new, fourth flags field for objects/player, for all the new
	  stuff such as cold touch. Actually unused yet.
	* Added a possibility to "theme" some powers, to avoid adding far
	  too many new PWR_*. For example, Chaos Dragons have "Identify"
	  power with the name "Chaos Knowledge".
	* Added bodies and corpses for some monsters from low dlvls, just
	  to test possessors :). If body/corpse is undefined for a monster,
	  it simply won't drop the corpse.
	* Added "lawful/chaotic" alignment for monsters. Lawfuls will attack
	  chaotics and vice versa. Somewhat funny to see mercenaries killing
	  beggars and lepers in town :). The flag is set only for few
	  monsters now.
	Added new monster races:
		- Soul - possessors; see above.
		- Chaos Dragon - breathes chaos, disenchantment and
		  confusion; some nice high-level powers (wonder, teleport,
		  summon chaotic (elemental) dragon, detection, identify,
		  alter reality, summon chaotic (elemental) ancient
		  dragons), but high exp penalty.
		- Ethereal Dragon - breathes light and darkness. Can absorb
		  light to heal itself, cast small but powerful light orbs,
		  cast huge but relatively weak darkness storms, and shift
		  planes - temporary immateriality).
		- Giant - humanoid monster. Limited to large weapons
		  (>= 18 lb., has large penalties with lighter ones),
		  large armor (at least metal brigandine). When digging
		  granite walls, can create boulders - heavy to carry, but
		  excellent damage when thrown. Resistant to confusion;
		  quickly gain new forms and resistances. Aggravating
		  at high levels. Huge STR and CON.
		- Kobold - mostly duplicates "normal" kobolds. Weak race.
		- Spider - +5 speed, good DEX, unique webbing ability.
		  (All monsters stuck in the webs cannot move or attack
		  in melee until they tear the webs. Chance to tear is
		  10-66%, depending on monster native level). Weak, fragile.
		  At higher levels, they can become phase spiders (+15
		  speed, phase door, teleport, teleport away, dimension
		  door; as weak as normal spiders) or araneas (large and
		  tough, fire and mind spells, summon spiders).
	* Dummy "Monster" class is not shown in most places. Instead, the
	  race name, which can be rather long, takes two lines.
	* Additional info for "l"ooking on monsters. For all monsters -
	  level, XP for kill. For pets (or in wizard mode) - precise
	  experience, HP, SP, AC, spell power etc.
	* Added infinite randarts.
	* Added support for themed vaults. Only two actually available
	  ("Greater Altar of Water" - Waldern's lair, with assorted water
	  and ice elementals; "Treasury of Nagas" - red and guardian nagas,
	  spider naga and some treasures in centre).
	* Added "reforge artifact" service in Adventurers Guild
	  (need fame of at least 50 - in 'excellent' range). It takes
	  existing artifact (not a randart!) and some money (artifact
	  "power" ^ 2 * 75) to make a randart from existing item.
	  Buggy, but interesting to play with :-). Potential use
	  for worthless artifacts.

	Bugfixes:

	* Code updated to NPP 0.3.4
	* Bugfix: NPP 0.3.1 slowing bug fixed, thanks to JG
	* Bugfix: innate attacks did not damage monsters in walls
	* Bugfix: innate attacks 'to hallucinate' would yield chaos attacks
	  in previous versions; chaos would polymorph, which would
	  render innate attacks unusable. Changed to disenchant.
	* Bugfix: all innate elemental attacks damage is now multiplied by
	  2. Hopefully will solve the problem when the dragon's fiery
	  bite was generally much worse than normal attacks, because many
	  monsters resist fire.
	* Bugfix: monsters with no_wield, but without any innate attacks
	  either (Qs, soul) didn't show any message in 'innate attacks'.
	* Bugfix: evasive monsters had double chance to evade innate
	  attack
	* Water elementals changed a bit (ice elementals are now not
	  stronger than water; added water vapor and greater water and
	  ice elementals.
	* Many other bugfixes. Mostly just annoying things.


Version 0.1.0 22-Feb-04 uav <uav@urmail.ru>

	* The game is migrated to NPPAngband 0.3.1 code base. 0.0.x
	  savefiles won't read. All the 0.0.2 features are migrated;
	  hopefully cleanly. Some things adapted for NPP.
	* Added new Dragon Scale Mails. Ideas from rgra by J.R.Dunson and
	  Neodymium. Makes all DSMs way more interesting. Maybe needs some
	  balancing, but generally ok.


Version 0.0.2 13-Jan-04 uav <uav@urmail.ru>

        * Some bugs fixed.
        * Three new flags for 'weird bodies'. COLD_TOUCH: shatters any potions
          or flasks of oil in inventory. NETHER_BEING: immune to cold, poison,
          darkness, nether, time (cold, darkness, nether attack heal some damage
          actually), but very susceptible to fire and light. PASS_WALL: 
          immaterial, like Sprites or Spectres in other variants, can pass
          through walls (NOT through impenerable, though), but takes 1 hp every
          turn in the wall (NOT below 0 hp - walking in walls weakens but not
          kills).
        * Two new races: Water Spirit (COLD_TOUCH), Lich (NETHER_BEING,
          PASS_WALL at Archlich stage). Water Spirit is a typical warrior; very
          poor INT/WIS, but can cast cold, water and ice bolts/balls. Lich is an
          INT-based spellcaster, has nether attacks, dispelling spells, various
          forms of beguiling and healing. Weak; very ugly. Both races are
          humanoid with normal slots. Note that I'm going to add Water Vapor
          and more other elemental forms in future (currently 3 forms, not
          many)
        * Monster races can now have arbitrary main stat (for powers); this
          reflects ideas I had at first
        * More powers for new races - still have to add many...
        * monraces.txt help file about monster races. I plan to keep similar
          monsters (say, undeads) in one section, with some general description,
          including background (from Tolkien, probably from AD&D).


Version 0.0.1 29-Dec-03 uav <uav@urmail.ru>

        * First version. Based on Vanilla Angband 3.0.3. Very basic things.

vim:syntax=changelog:tw=78

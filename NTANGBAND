What is the difference between Pern and NT?

NT attempts to be Non-Tolkienian.

NT attempts to make nonviolence possible.
  By allowing peaceful professions
  By allowing nonviolent ways to gain exp

NT also attempts to provide both zany dungeons and deep, intense places.

This game attempts to be whatever I think should be in Angband.

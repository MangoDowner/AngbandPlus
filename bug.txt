Known bugs:
	Pluralization bugs everywhere. staff->staves is proper.
	When posessors are forced out of corpse, but are wearing cursed
		item, nothing happens. Fix will be implemented once we
		have DG's golem code (after this release), at which
		point the body will be mangled into a blob with all the
		old corpse's equipment slots

        Monster memory does not fully work for ego monsters
	Items mutate (!).  Start a DragonRidder and see what happens to
		your firescones in Angband (if you have the old files)
	Spellbooks are wrong.  You cast the right spells, but the books
		have the wrong names. (Note:  I know how to fix this,
		but I don't deem it pointful until magic stabilizes,
		probably not for a few releases.)
	The help files are hopelessly out of date.  I would not rely on
		anything you read there.  It could help you, but it 
		could hurt you.  The change log is your friend.  I am
		your friend.  Ask me.

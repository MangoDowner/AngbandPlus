Known bugs:
- When saving while in a 'only once' quest and then reloading if you exit
  without completing the quest it's not marked as failed ...
- Corpses weight ... is strange when hacked
- Artifacts can reappear if leaved on saved
  levels, they should NOT !
- when god gets angry it may crash the game, but the savefile is safe
- display of the attributes when pressing C is broken(will be fixed in the
  next version)

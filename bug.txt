# Known bugs:
[B]- Pluralization bugs everywhere. staff->staves is proper.
[B]- When posessors are forced out of corpse, but are wearing cursed
     item, nothing happens. Fix will be implemented once we
     have DG's golem code (after this release), at which
     point the body will be mangled into a blob with all the
     old corpse's equipment slots
[B]- Monster memory does not fully work for ego monsters
[B]- Teleport level out of dungeons, recalling into a dungeon and taking stairs
     out of it, or changing wilderness mode sometimes brings player to a strange
     location.
[B]- Ego types (like a Cursed Ring of Stupidity) will prevent the
     automatizer from destroying an otherwise destroyable item

[V]  T.o.M.E 2.1.1 aka "Once more unto the breach"

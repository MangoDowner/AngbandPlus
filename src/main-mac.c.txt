How to compile:
 - Move PernAngband.proj, PernAngband.r and Carbon.r from the src
   directory to its parent,
 - Double-click on PernAngband.proj,
 - Please take a look at the comment in A-mac-h.pch for a couple of
   source code modifications that may be necessary,
 - Click on the build button, or choose that from the project menu,
 - Hope it works.

Graphic tiles and sounds are not included in the standard
distribution because of their sheer size. You can either
remove them from your project file or copy them from
existing Conglomo binary.

Carbon compilation requires Carbon SDK 1.1(?) or greater,
freely downloadable from Apple. The project file assumes
that "Carbon Support" folder should be placed directly
beneath your CodeWarrior compiler folder, i.e. where
"MacOS Support", "MSL" etc are.

The resource editing instruction in the original file is
now obsolete, so I removed it.

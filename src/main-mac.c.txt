How to compile:
 - Move PernAngband.proj and PernAngband.r from the src directory to
   its parent,
 - Double-click on PernAngband.proj,
 - Please take a look at the comment in A-mac-h.pch for a couple of
   source code modifications that may be necessary,
 - Click on the build button, or choose that from the project menu,
 - Hope it works.


* main-mac.c that supports 16x16 tileset and transparency effect
  for use in PernAngband *

It's taken from Vanilla 2.9.2 and slightly modified for
the savefile menu screen of PernAngband CVS.  Since DG does't
like to see New/Open(/Import) menus in his game any longer
(I cannot accuse him: windowing system ports have always been
incredibly messy because of these), you have to modify resource
file as well: you can either use the one that should come along
with source code ---together or separately--- or edit your
favourite one to make the file menu look like this:

	 File
    ------------------
	|Close #W|
	|Save  #S|
	|--------|
	|Exit  #E|
	|Quit  #Q|
	+--------+

I used 'PrnA' for the creator signature and replaced "Angband"
with "PernAngband" in the name of Preferences file.

For graphics tils support, please pay close attention to the value
of pictRows. It almost certainly need adjustment...
Please count numbers of rows in 8x8 and 16x16, then substitute
the values for those in:

static int pictRows = 79;	<-- here (8x8)

and 

	    if (streq(ANGBAND_GRAF, "old"))
	    {
		    ANGBAND_GRAF = "new";
		    arg_transparency = true;
		    pictID = 1002;
		    maskID = 1003;
		    grafWidth = grafHeight = 16;
		    pictRows = 70;	<-- here (16x16)
	    }
	    else
	    {
		    ANGBAND_GRAF = "old";
		    arg_transparency = false;
		    pictID = 1001;
		    maskID = 1001;
		    grafWidth = grafHeight = 8;
		    pictRows = 79;	<-- and here (8x8).
	    }

Note to porters: say

#define USE_TRANSPARENCY

in A-mac-h.pch.

 * very useful if this file can optimize its own display calls.

/*
 * Instantiate a "term_data" structure
 *
 * This is one way to prepare the "term_data" structures and to
 * "link" the various informational pieces together.
 *
 * This function assumes that every window should be 80x24 in size
 * (the standard size) and should be able to queue 256 characters.
 * Technically, only the "main screen window" needs to queue any
 * characters, but this method is simple.  One way to allow some
 * variation is to add fields to the "term_data" structure listing
 * parameters for that window, initialize them in the "init_xxx()"
 * function, and then use them in the code below.
 *
 * Note that "activation" calls the "Term_init_xxx()" hook for
 * the "term" structure, if needed.
 *
 * This function is called at the end of main-sdl.c's term_data_link
 * before "activation." You should use it to overwrite main-sdl.c's default
 * values. If, and only if, this function gets called, the user wants to 
 * use this graphics engine. 
 *
 * The most impotant thing here is hook initialization. It is appropriate
 * to call term_init() here since it will not be called from main-sdl.c's
 * term_data_link() if an alternate graphics engine is requested.
 *
 * Likely default flags have been uncommented. Fix them if they're not right
 * for you.

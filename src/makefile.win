# File: Makefile

# This is not a very "nice" Makefile, but it usually works.

#
# Note that you may have to make modifications below according
# to your machine, available libraries, compilation options,
# and your "visual module" of choice.  This Makefile is intended
# for use with Unix machines running X11, Curses, Ncurses, or Vt100,
# or possibly for "Atari" or "Amiga" computers with "Curses" ports,
# see below for more information.
#
# Note that "main-mac.c", the visual module for the Macintosh,
# must be compiled in a special way, see elsewhere.
#
# Note that "main-win.c", the visual module for Windows,
# must be compiled in a special way, see elsewhere.
#
# Note that "main-ibm.c", "main-emx.c", and "main-286.c",
# the visual modules for various types of IBM-PC computers,
# must be compiled with special Makefiles, see elsewhere.
#
# Note that "main-lsl.c", the visual module for ???,
# must be compiled with "Makefile.lsl", see elsewhere.
#
# Note that "main-acn.c", the visual module for Risc Acorn,
# must be compiled with "Makefile.acn", see elsewhere.
#
# Note that "Makefile.w31" and "Makefile.wat" are slight variations
# on "Makefile.win" and "Makefile.ibm", respectively, which allow
# the use of the "main-win.c" and "main-ibm.c" files, respectively,
# with special compilers.
#
# If you are able to construct "main-xxx.c" and/or "Makefile.xxx"
# files for a currently unsupported system, please send them to me
# (benh@voicenet.com) for inclusion in future versions.
#
# This Makefile comes with "default" dependancies that may be obsolete.
#
# You may want to run "make depend" if you are planning on changing
# anything.
#


#
# The "source" and "object" files.

##
## Following are some "system" definitions
##
## No changes are needed to compile a version that will run on both
## X11 and Curses, in debugging mode, with maximal warnings, on many
## normal Unix machines of the Sun OS variety (non-solaris).
##
## To use an "alternative" definition, simply "modify" (or "replace")
## the definition below with one that you like.  For example, you can
## change the compiler to "cc", or remove the "debugging" options, or
## remove the X11 or Curses support, etc, as desired.
##
## See also "config.h" and "h-config.h" for important information.
##
## Some "examples" are given below, they can be used by simply
## removing the FIRST column of "#" signs from the "block" of lines
## you wish to use, and commenting out "standard" block below.
##
## This is not intended to be a "good" Makefile, just a "simple" one.

# Standard version (see main-x11.c and main-gcu.c)
#
# This version supports both "X11" and "curses" in a single executable.
#
# You may have to add various X11 include/library directories to the
# "CFLAGS", if your machine places files in a weird location.
#
# You may be able to remove "-ltermcap" on some machines (ex: Solaris).
#
# You may have to replace "-lcurses" with "-lncurses" to use the
# "new curses" library instead of the "old curses" library, and
# you may have to add "-l/usr/include/ncurses" to the "CFLAGS".
#
# See "main-gcu.c" and "config.h" for some optional "curses" defines,
# including "USE_GETCH" and "USE_CURS_SET".  Note that "config.h" will
# attempt to "guess" at many of these flags based on your system.

/*
 * Look through the following lines, and where a comment includes the
 * tag "OPTION:", examine the associated "#define" statements, and decide
 * whether you wish to keep, comment, or uncomment them.  You should not
 * have to modify any lines not indicated by "OPTION".
 *
 * A number of compile options have been removed in Sangband, usually for
 * one of three reasons:
 * 1) The code in question has been fully incorporated into the game,
 *   like monster fear, the DRS monster memory code, and Tim Baker's easy
 *   patch.
 * 2) The feature no longer imposes any significant costs (monster terror).
 * 3) The game no longer supports x286-based machines (because of the use
 *   of 64K arrays to hold monster descriptions, and because the code now
 *   runs very slowly on them).
 *
 * Note: Also examine the "system" configuration file "h-config.h".  A
 * lot of options have been moved there.
 *
 * And finally, remember that the "Makefile" will specify some rather
 * important compile time options, like what visual module to use.

/*
 * OPTION: Verify savefile Checksums (Angband 2.7.0 and up)

/*
 * OPTION: Forbid the use of "fiddled" savefiles.  As far as I can tell,
 * a fiddled savefile is one with an internal timestamp different from
 * the actual timestamp.  Thus, turning this option on forbids one from
 * copying a savefile to a different name.  Combined with disabling the
 * ability to save the game without quitting, and with some method of
 * stopping the user from killing the process at the tombstone screen,
 * this should prevent the use of backup savefiles.  It may also stop
 * the use of savefiles from other platforms, so be careful.
 */
/* #define VERIFY_TIMESTAMP */


/*
 * OPTION: Forbid the "savefile over-write" cheat, in which you simply
 * run another copy of the game, loading a previously saved savefile,
 * and let that copy over-write the "dead" savefile later.  This option
 * either locks the savefile, or creates a fake "xxx.lok" file to prevent
 * the use of the savefile until the file is deleted.  Not ready yet.

 * the user will run "angband" from the same directory that contains
 * the "lib" directory.  This is a reasonable (but imperfect) default.
 *
 * If at all possible, you should change this value to refer to the

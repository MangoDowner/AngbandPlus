These files are meant to be a guide and to make my life simpler.  If you want
to use them for any purpose (for instance, in a different variant) feel free,
but give me credit and tell me about it.  (Well, if you're just going to grep
it or print it out, I don't care, but please leave my name in your revisions.)
If I am leaving out some vital information, tell me.

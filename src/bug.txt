Known bugs:
- The spell window code is disabled
- The streamers are disabled(in some dungeons)
- Problems when killing Bull Gate in the M$ quest, which are somewhat linked
  to the mysterious shadow clock apparition in the wilderness
- When saving while in a 'only once' quest and then reloading if you exit
  without completing the quest it's not marked as failed ...

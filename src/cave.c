/*
 * A simple, fast, integer-based line-of-sight algorithm.  By Joseph Hall,
 * 4116 Brewster Drive, Raleigh NC 27606.  Email to jnh@ecemwl.ncsu.edu.
 *
 * Returns TRUE if a line of sight can be traced from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).
 *
 * The LOS begins at the center of the tile (x1,y1) and ends at the center of
 * the tile (x2,y2).  If los() is to return TRUE, all of the tiles this line
 * passes through must be floor tiles, except for (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
 *
 * We assume that the "mathematical corner" of a non-floor tile does not
 * block line of sight.
 *
 * Because this function uses (short) ints for all calculations, overflow may
 * occur if dx and dy exceed 90.
 *
 * Once all the degenerate cases are eliminated, the values "qx", "qy", and
 * "m" are multiplied by a scale factor "f1 = abs(dx * dy * 2)", so that
 * we can use integer arithmetic.
 *
 * We travel from start to finish along the longer axis, starting at the border
 * between the first and second tiles, where the y offset = .5 * slope, taking
 * into account the scale factor.  See below.
 *
 * Also note that this function and the "move towards target" code do NOT
 * share the same properties.  Thus, you can see someone, target them, and
 * then fire a bolt at them, but the bolt may hit a wall, not them.  However,
 * by clever choice of target locations, you can sometimes throw a "curve".
 *
 * Note that "line of sight" is not "reflexive" in all cases.
 *
 * Use the "projectable()" routine to test "spell/missile line of sight".
 *
 * Use the "update_view()" function to determine player line-of-sight.

/*
 * Can the player "see" the given grid?
 *
 * He must have vision, illumination, and line of sight.
 *
 * If the player is "blind", then no grids can be "seen".
 *
 * Note that "CAVE_LITE" means that a grid is lit by the player's torch,
 * which means that the grid is "lit" and "viewable", so all such grids
 * can, by definition, be "seen".
 *
 * Note that "CAVE_GLOW" means that a grid is "permanently illuminated",
 * which, normally, means that if the grid is "viewable", then it can be
 * "seen".  But for wall/door grids, since they are not "translucent",
 * this is only true if, in addition, the grid which is closest to the
 * player and adjacent to the wall grid is also "permanently lit".
 *
 * This bizarre method for handling perma-lit wall grids may be more
 * expensive than simply assuming that perma-lit wall grids, like the
 * floor grids, can be seen when viewable, but it provides a somewhat
 * more "correct" semantics, in particular, it prevents the player from
 * "seeing" the wall of a room from a hallway running next to the room.
 *
 * Technically, we should check all eight grids adjacent to the wall grid,
 * and if any of them are "perma-lit" non-wall grids which are "viewable"
 * to the player, then the wall grid, if perma-lit itself, can be "seen",
 * but this is extremely expensive, and dangerous, if the wall grid is
 * adjacent to any "illegal" grids.  But the semantics would be slightly
 * better, for example, currently, wall grids which frame the "entrance"
 * to a lit room cannot be "seen" by a player in a dark hallway.
 *
 * We must be very careful about combining this function, in particular,
 * the parts which deal with "perma-lit" wall grids, with any optimized
 * algorithms, such as the "update_view()" code, which only calls the
 * "note_spot()" function (which uses an "inline" version of this code)
 * for grids which "change" viewability, since strange things may happen
 * if we are not careful.  For example, when a player enters a lit room,
 * from a dark hall, through a closed door, with no torch, we must ensure
 * that the walls adjacent to the door are "seen" from the doorway.
 *
 * The "doorway" example is responsible for the "optional" method shown
 * below, in which we check three adjacent grids instead of just a single
 * adjacent grid, and we forbid these grids from being walls.
 *
 * See also the various "inline" versions of "player_can_see_bold()", for
 * example, in the "note_spot()" and "map_info()" functions.

/*
 * Extract the attr/char to display at the given (legal) map location
 *
 * Basically, we "paint" the chosen attr/char in several passes, starting
 * with any known "terrain features" (defaulting to darkness), then adding
 * any known "objects", then adding any known "monsters", and then adding
 * the player if needed.  This is not the fastest method but since most of
 * the calls to this function are made for grids with no objects, monsters,
 * or players, it should be fast enough.
 *
 * Note that the "zero" entry in the feature/object/monster arrays are
 * used to provide "special" attr/char codes, with "monster zero" being
 * used for the player attr/char, "object zero" being used for the "stack"
 * attr/char, and "feature zero" being used for the "nothing" attr/char,
 * though this function makes use of only "feature zero".  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * Note that monsters can have some "special" flags, including "ATTR_MULTI",
 * which means their color changes, and "ATTR_CLEAR", which means they take
 * the color of whatever is under them, and "CHAR_CLEAR", which means that
 * they take the symbol of whatever is under them.  Technically, the flag
 * "CHAR_MULTI" is supposed to indicate that a monster looks strange when
 * examined, but this flag is currently ignored.  All of these flags are
 * ignored if the "avoid_other" option is set, since checking for these
 * conditions is expensive and annoying on some systems.
 *
 * Currently, we do nothing with multi-hued objects, because there are
 * not any.  If there were, they would have to set "shimmer_objects"
 * when they were created, and then new "shimmer" code in "dungeon.c"
 * would have to be created handle the "shimmer" effect, and the code
 * in "cave.c" would have to be updated to create the shimmer effect.
 *
 * Note the effects of hallucination.  Objects always appear as random
 * "objects", monsters as random "monsters", and normal grids occasionally
 * appear as random "monsters" or "objects", but note that these random
 * "monsters" and "objects" are really just "colored ascii symbols".
 *
 * Note that "floors" and "invisible traps" (and "zero" features) are
 * drawn as "floors" using a special check for optimization purposes,
 * and these are the only features which get drawn using the special
 * lighting effects activated by "view_special_lite".
 *
 * Note the use of the "mimic" field in the "terrain feature" processing,
 * which allows any feature to "pretend" to be another feature.  This is
 * used to "hide" secret doors, and to make all "doors" appear the same,
 * and all "walls" appear the same, and "hidden" treasure stay hidden.
 * It is possible to use this field to make a feature "look" like a floor,
 * but the "special lighting effects" for floors will not be used.
 *
 * Note the use of the new "terrain feature" information.  Note that the
 * assumption that all interesting "objects" and "terrain features" are
 * memorized allows extremely optimized processing below.  Note the use
 * of separate flags on objects to mark them as memorized allows a grid
 * to have memorized "terrain" without granting knowledge of any object
 * which may appear in that grid.
 *
 * Note the efficient code used to determine if a "floor" grid is
 * "memorized" or "viewable" by the player, where the test for the
 * grid being "viewable" is based on the facts that (1) the grid
 * must be "lit" (torch-lit or perma-lit), (2) the grid must be in
 * line of sight, and (3) the player must not be blind, and uses the
 * assumption that all torch-lit grids are in line of sight.
 *
 * Note that floors (and invisible traps) are the only grids which are
 * not memorized when seen, so only these grids need to check to see if
 * the grid is "viewable" to the player (if it is not memorized).  Since
 * most non-memorized grids are in fact walls, this induces *massive*
 * efficiency, at the cost of *forcing* the memorization of non-floor
 * grids when they are first seen.  Note that "invisible traps" are
 * always treated exactly like "floors", which prevents "cheating".
 *
 * Note the "special lighting effects" which can be activated for floor
 * grids using the "view_special_lite" option (for "white" floor grids),
 * causing certain grids to be displayed using special colors.  If the
 * player is "blind", we will use "dark gray", else if the grid is lit
 * by the torch, and the "view_yellow_lite" option is set, we will use
 * "yellow", else if the grid is "dark", we will use "dark gray", else
 * if the grid is not "viewable", and the "view_bright_lite" option is
 * set, and the we will use "slate" (gray).  We will use "white" for all
 * other cases, in particular, for illuminated viewable floor grids.
 *
 * Note the "special lighting effects" which can be activated for wall
 * grids using the "view_granite_lite" option (for "white" wall grids),
 * causing certain grids to be displayed using special colors.  If the
 * player is "blind", we will use "dark gray", else if the grid is lit
 * by the torch, and the "view_yellow_lite" option is set, we will use
 * "yellow", else if the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid
 * is not "viewable", or is "dark", or is glowing, but not when viewed
 * from the player's current location, we will use "slate" (gray).  We
 * will use "white" for all other cases, in particular, for correctly
 * illuminated viewable wall grids.
 *
 * Note that, when "view_granite_lite" is set, we use an inline version
 * of the "player_can_see_bold()" function to check the "viewability" of
 * grids when the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and we do NOT use
 * any special colors for "dark" wall grids, since this would allow the
 * player to notice the walls of illuminated rooms from a hallway that
 * happened to run beside the room.
 *
 * Note that bizarre things must be done when the "attr" and/or "char"
 * codes have the "high-bit" set, since these values are used to encode
 * various "special" pictures in some versions, and certain situations,
 * such as "multi-hued" or "clear" monsters, cause the attr/char codes
 * to be "scrambled" in various ways.
 *
 * Note that eventually we may use the "&" symbol for embedded treasure,
 * and use the "*" symbol to indicate multiple objects, though this will
 * have to wait for Angband 2.8.2 or later.  Currently, we simply use
 * the attr/char of the first "marked" object in the stack.  If we did
 * use some special symbol, it could be stored in "f_info[0]".
 *
 * Note the assumption that doing "x_ptr = &x_info[x]" plus a few of
 * "x_ptr->xxx", is quicker than "x_info[x].xxx", if this is incorrect
 * then a whole lot of code should be changed...  XXX XXX XXX

 * Note that the memorization of objects is completely separate from

 * and object memorization when an object is dropped into a floor grid
 * which is memorized but out-of-sight.
 *
 * This function should be called every time the "memorization" of
 * a grid (or the object in a grid) is called into question, such
 * as when an object is created in a grid, when a terrain feature
 * "changes" from "floor" to "non-floor", when any grid becomes
 * "illuminated" or "viewable", and when a "floor" grid becomes
 * "torch-lit".
 *
 * Note the relatively efficient use of this function by the various

 * viewable or illuminated in any way, but not when they "maintain"
 * or "lose" their previous viewability or illumination.

/*
 * Some comments on the cave grid flags.
 *
 *
 * One of the major bottlenecks in ancient versions of Angband was in
 * the calculation of "line of sight" from the player to various grids,
 * such as monsters, using the relatively expensive "los()" function.
 * This was such a nasty bottleneck that a lot of silly things were done
 * to reduce the dependancy on "line of sight", for example, you could
 * not "see" any grids in a lit room until you actually entered the room,
 * at which point every grid in the room became "illuminated", and there
 * were all kinds of bizarre grid flags to support this behavior.  There
 * were other somewhat related bottlenecks involved in the determination
 * of which grids were illuminated by the player's light source.
 *
 * These bottlenecks led to the developement of special new functions to
 * optimize issues involved with "line of sight" and "torch lit grids".
 *
 * The "update_view()" function, below, is used to pre-calculate the
 * entire "field of view" for the player, which, once calculated, can
 * be used to provide an extremely fast method for determining if a grid
 * is in "line of sight" of the player.  It sets the "CAVE_VIEW" flag
 * on every cave grid in the player's field of view, and maintains an
 * array of all such grids in the global "view_n" array.  See also the
 * "player_has_los_bold()" function.
 *
 * The "update_lite()" function, below, is used to pre-calculate the
 * entire "set of torch lit grids", which, once calculated, can be used
 * by the "player_can_see_bold()" function to provide an extremely fast
 * method for determining if a particular grid is illuminated.  It sets
 * the "CAVE_LITE" flag on every cave grid lit by the player's torch, and
 * and maintains an array of all such grids in the global "lite_n" array.
 * See also the "player_has_los_bold()" function.
 *
 * The special arrays maintained by the "update_view()" and "update_lite()"
 * functions can be used not only to quickly scan through all the grids in
 * the dungeon with one of the two related cave grid flags set, but also,
 * in conjunction with another special temporary array, and the "CAVE_TEMP"
 * cave grid flag, are used to redraw any grid which enters or leaves the
 * player's field of view or torch lit range.  This allows the use of some
 * interesting "special lighting effects" (see elsewhere).
 *
 * The "CAVE_TEMP" flag, and the array of "CAVE_TEMP" grids, is also used
 * for various other purposes, all temporary, such as spreading lite or
 * darkness during "lite_room()" / "unlite_room()", and for calculating
 * monster flow.  This flag is always cleared when we are done.
 *
 * The current "update_view()" algorithm uses the "CAVE_XTRA" flag as a
 * temporary internal flag to mark those grids which are not only in view,
 * but which are also "easily" in line of sight of the player.  This flag
 * is always cleared when we are done.
 *
 * For various subtle reasons described in the "player_can_see_bold()"
 * function, any perma-lit wall grids which "remain" in the field of view
 * must be redrawn each time the field of view is recalculated, as if they
 * are just entering the field of view.
 *
 * For efficiency, the "update_lite()" function uses the results of the
 * "update_view()" function, so "update_view()" must be called before
 * "update_lite()".
 *
 * For efficiency, the "update_lite()" function is optimized for the
 * standard cases of a torch lite radius less than or equal to three.
 *
 * For efficiency, the "update_view()" function is only called when the
 * player moves, and when a wall grid becomes a floor grid, or vice versa,
 * while in the player's field of view.
 *
 * For efficiency, the "update_lite()" function is only called when the
 * player moves, when a wall grid becomes a floor grid, or vice versa,
 * while in the player's field of view, or when the player's torch lite
 * radius changes.
 *
 * Note that when the player is resting, or performing most repeated
 * actions, such as digging, there is no need to call either of these
 * two functions.  This means that the game is extremely fast unless
 * the player is running through the dungeon.
 *
 * I wouldn't be surprised if slight modifications to the "update_view()"
 * function would allow us to determine "reverse line-of-sight" as well
 * as "normal line-of-sight", which would allow monsters to use a more
 * "correct" calculation to determine if they can "see" the player.  For
 * now, monsters simply "cheat" somewhat and assume that if the player
 * has "line of sight" to the monster, then the monster can "pretend"
 * that it has "line of sight" to the player.
 *
 *
 * Any grid can be marked as "CAVE_GLOW" which means that the grid itself is
 * in some way permanently lit.  However, for the player to "see" anything
 * in the grid, as determined by "player_can_see_bold()", the player must not
 * be blind, the grid must be marked as "CAVE_VIEW", and, in addition, "wall"
 * grids, even if marked as "perma lit", are only illuminated if they touch
 * a grid which is not a wall and is marked both "CAVE_GLOW" and "CAVE_VIEW",
 * and that grid must be closer to the player than the wall grid.  Note that
 * this last condition can cause problems, see "player_can_see_bold()".
 *
 * To simplify various things, a grid may be marked as "CAVE_MARK", meaning
 * that even if the player cannot "see" the grid, he "knows" the terrain in
 * that grid.  This is used to "remember" walls/doors/stairs/floors when they
 * are "seen" or "detected", and also to "memorize" floors, after "wiz_lite()",
 * or when one of the "memorize floor grids" options induces memorization.
 *
 * Objects are "memorized" in a different way, using a special "marked" flag
 * on the object itself, which is set when an object is observed or detected.
 *
 * A grid may be marked as "CAVE_ROOM" which means that it is part of a "room",
 * and should be illuminated by "lite room" and "darkness" spells.
 *
 * A grid may be marked as "CAVE_ICKY" which means it is part of a "vault",
 * and should be unavailable for "teleportation" destinations.
 *
 *
 * The "view_perma_grids" allows the player to "memorize" every perma-lit grid
 * which is observed, and the "view_torch_grids" allows the player to memorize
 * every torch-lit grid.  The player will always memorize important walls,
 * doors, stairs, and other terrain features, as well as any "detected" grids.
 *
 * Note that the new "update_view()" method allows, among other things, a room
 * to be "partially" seen as the player approaches it, with a growing cone of
 * floor appearing as the player gets closer to the door.  Also, by not turning
 * on the "memorize perma-lit grids" option, the player will only "see" those
 * floor grids which are actually in line of sight.
 *
 * And my favorite "plus" is that you can now use a special option to draw the
 * "floors" in the "viewable region" brightly (actually, to draw the *other*
 * grids dimly), providing a "pretty" effect as the player runs around, and
 * to efficiently display the "torch lite" in a special color.

/*
 * Some comments on the "update_lite()" function...

 * The "update_lite()" function uses the results of "update_view()".

/*
 * Some comments on the "update_view()" algorithm...
 *
 * Algorithm summary:
 *
 *  1: Process the player
 *  1a: The player is always (easily) viewable
 *  2: Process the diagonals
 *  2a: The diagonals are (easily) viewable up to the first wall
 *  2b: But never go more than 2/3 of the "full" distance
 *  3: Process the main axes
 *  3a: The main axes are (easily) viewable up to the first wall
 *  3b: But never go more than the "full" distance
 *  4: Process sequential "strips" in each of the eight octants
 *  4a: Each strip runs along the previous strip
 *  4b: The main axes are "previous" to the first strip
 *  4c: Process both "sides" of each "direction" of each strip
 *  4c1: Each side aborts as soon as possible
 *  4c2: Each side tells the next strip how far it has to check
 *
 * Note that the octant processing involves some pretty interesting
 * observations involving when a grid might possibly be viewable from
 * a given grid, and on the order in which the strips are processed.
 *
 * Note the use of the mathematical facts shown below, which derive
 * from the fact that (1 < sqrt(2) < 1.5), and that the length of the
 * hypotenuse of a right triangle is primarily determined by the length
 * of the longest side, when one side is small, and is strictly less
 * than one-and-a-half times as long as the longest side when both of
 * the sides are large.
 *
 *   if (manhatten(dy,dx) < R) then (hypot(dy,dx) < R)
 *   if (manhatten(dy,dx) > R*3/2) then (hypot(dy,dx) > R)
 *
 *   hypot(dy,dx) is approximated by (dx+dy+MAX(dx,dy)) / 2
 *
 * These observations are important because the calculation of the actual
 * value of "hypot(dx,dy)" is extremely expensive, involving square roots,
 * while for small values (up to about 20 or so), the approximations above
 * are correct to within an error of at most one grid or so.
 *
 * Observe the use of "full" and "over" in the code below, and the use of
 * the specialized calculation involving "limit", all of which derive from
 * the observations given above.  Basically, we note that the "circle" of
 * view is completely contained in an "octagon" whose bounds are easy to
 * determine, and that only a few steps are needed to derive the actual
 * bounds of the circle given the bounds of the octagon.
 *
 * Note that by skipping all the grids in the corners of the octagon, we
 * place an upper limit on the number of grids in the field of view, given
 * that "full" is never more than 20.  Of the 1681 grids in the "square" of
 * view, only about 1475 of these are in the "octagon" of view, and even
 * fewer are in the "circle" of view, so 1500 or 1536 is more than enough
 * entries to completely contain the actual field of view.
 *
 * Note also the care taken to prevent "running off the map".  The use of
 * explicit checks on the "validity" of the "diagonal", and the fact that
 * the loops are never allowed to "leave" the map, lets "update_view_aux()"
 * use the optimized "cave_floor_bold()" macro, and to avoid the overhead
 * of multiple checks on the validity of grids.  Note that for months we
 * were using a meaningless test for "East strip, South side", so it looks
 * like perhaps the first half of each of those tests is obsolete given the
 * test for the "optimizations" below.
 *
 * The bizarre "se","sw","ne","nw","es","en","ws","wn" variables are very
 * important.  They indicate, for each "strip" (named by major axis and
 * then minor direction), the maximal distance which may be traveled along
 * that strip.  They start out as the maximum viewable distance, modified
 * if needed to avoid leaving the dungeon.  Then, for example, consider the
 * "se" variable.  While moving down the south-bound strip just to the east
 * of the main south axis, as soon as we get to a grid which does not allow
 * "viewing" to pass, if all previous related strips (including the primary
 * "south" axis) have terminated at or before the same point, then we can
 * stop, and reset the "max distance" to ourself.  Draw a picture if needed.
 *
 * Note the use of efficiency macros.  The "cave_view_hack()" macro is a
 * chunk of code which adds the given location to the "view" array if it
 * is not already there, using both the actual location and a pointer to
 * the cave grid.  See above.
 *
 * By the way, the purpose of this code is to reduce the dependancy on the
 * "los()" function which is slow, and, in some cases, not very accurate.
 *
 * It is very possible that I am the only person who fully understands this
 * function, and for that I am truly sorry, but efficiency was very important
 * and the "simple" version of this function was just not fast enough.  I am
 * more than willing to replace this function with a simpler one, if it is
 * equally efficient, and especially willing if the new function happens to
 * derive "reverse-line-of-sight" at the same time, since currently monsters
 * just use an optimized hack of "you see me, so I see you", and then use the
 * actual "projectable()" function to check spell attacks.
 *
 * The algorithm is very fast, since it spreads "obvious" grids very quickly,
 * and only has to call "los()" on the borderline cases.  The major axes/diags
 * even terminate early when they hit walls.  I need to find a quick way
 * to "terminate" the other scans.
 *
 * Note that in the worst case (a big empty area with say 5% scattered walls),
 * each of the 1500 or so nearby grids is checked once, most of them getting
 * an "instant" rating, and only a small portion requiring a call to "los()".
 *
 * The only time that the algorithm appears to be "noticeably" too slow is
 * when running, and this is usually only important in town, since the town
 * provides about the worst scenario possible, with large open regions and
 * a few scattered obstructions.  There is a special "efficiency" option to
 * allow the player to reduce his field of view in town, if needed.
 *
 * In the "best" case (say, a normal stretch of corridor), the algorithm
 * makes one check for each viewable grid, and makes no calls to "los()".
 * So running in corridors is very fast, and if a lot of monsters are
 * nearby, it is much faster than the old methods.
 *
 * Note that resting, most normal commands, and several forms of running,
 * plus all commands executed near large groups of monsters, are strictly
 * more efficient with "update_view()" that with the old "compute los() on
 * demand" method, primarily because once the "field of view" has been
 * calculated, it does not have to be recalculated until the player moves
 * (or a wall or door is created or destroyed).
 *
 * Note that we no longer have to do as many "los()" checks, since once the
 * "view" region has been built, very few things cause it to be "changed"
 * (player movement, and the opening/closing of doors, changes in wall status).
 * Note that door/wall changes are only relevant when the door/wall itself is
 * in the "view" region.
 *
 * The algorithm seems to only call "los()" from zero to ten times, usually
 * only when coming down a corridor into a room, or standing in a room, just
 * misaligned with a corridor.  So if, say, there are five "nearby" monsters,
 * we will be reducing the calls to "los()".
 *
 * I am thinking in terms of an algorithm that "walks" from the central point
 * out to the maximal "distance", at each point, determining the "view" code
 * (above).  For each grid not on a major axis or diagonal, the "view" code
 * depends on the "cave_floor_bold()" and "view" of exactly two other grids
 * (the one along the nearest diagonal, and the one next to that one, see
 * "update_view_aux()"...).
 *
 * In the worst "normal" case (in the middle of the town), the reachable space
 * actually reaches to more than half of the largest possible "circle" of view,
 * or about 800 grids, and in the worse case (in the middle of a dungeon level
 * where all the walls have been removed), the reachable space actually reaches
 * the theoretical maximum size of just under 1500 grids.
 *
 * The picture below shows the player and one quandrant (two octants) of the
 * viewable region, and the order in which the grids are processed.  The pure
 * diagonals and main axes are processed first, up to the appropriate distance,
 * and then the sequential strips are processed (one in each octant), also up
 * to the appropriate distance.

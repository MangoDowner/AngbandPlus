/*
 * This table is used to help calculate the number of blows the player can
 * make in a single round of attacks (one player turn) with a normal weapon.
 *
 * This number ranges from a single blow/round for weak players to up to six
 * blows/round for powerful warriors.
 *
 * Note that certain artifacts and ego-items give "bonus" blows/round.
 *
 * First, from the player class, we extract some values:
 *
 *    Warrior --> num = 6; mul = 5; div = MAX(30, weapon_weight);
 *    Mage    --> num = 4; mul = 2; div = MAX(40, weapon_weight);
 *    Priest  --> num = 5; mul = 3; div = MAX(35, weapon_weight);
 *    Rogue   --> num = 5; mul = 3; div = MAX(30, weapon_weight);
 *    Ranger  --> num = 5; mul = 4; div = MAX(35, weapon_weight);
 *    Paladin --> num = 5; mul = 4; div = MAX(30, weapon_weight);
 *
 * To get "P", we look up the relevant "adj_str_blow[]" (see above),
 * multiply it by "mul", and then divide it by "div", rounding down.
 *
 * To get "D", we look up the relevant "adj_dex_blow[]" (see above),
 * note especially column 6 (DEX 18/101) and 11 (DEX 18/150).
 *
 * The player gets "blows_table[P][D]" blows/round, as shown below,
 * up to a maximum of "num" blows/round, plus any "bonus" blows/round.

 *
 * Note that the table has been changed at high speeds.  From
 * "Slow (-40)" to "Fast (+30)" is pretty much unchanged, but
 * at speeds above "Fast (+30)", one approaches an asymptotic
 * effective limit of 50 energy per turn.  This means that it

 * point of getting 45 energy per turn.  After that point,
 * further increases in speed are more or less pointless,
 * except to balance out heavy inventory.
 *
 * Note that currently the fastest monster is "Fast (+30)".
 *
 * It should be possible to lower the energy threshold from
 * 100 units to 50 units, though this may interact badly with
 * the (compiled out) small random energy boost code.  It may
 * also tend to cause more "clumping" at high speeds.

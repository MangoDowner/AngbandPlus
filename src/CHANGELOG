		Can now wield item from floor to complete a quest.
		Screen not always refreshed in casino; fixed.
		Roguelike commands wouldn't work in new buildings. Hopefully fixed.
		Extra shopkeepers added (previously, Black Market and Bookstore had
			the same owners (with the same greed levels...))
		Fixed/added a few prototypes. Some functions called with too many
			arguments, etc.
		Few other minor alterations.

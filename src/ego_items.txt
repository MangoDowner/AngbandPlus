How to use the ego-item generation patch for your own customizations

The format of the e_info.txt file has changed. I think it is best explained
with an example:

N:9:of Elvenkind
X:30:25:2
W:0:40:0:15000
C:0:0:10:0
T:36:0:99
T:37:0:99
F:RES_ACID | RES_ELEC | RES_FIRE | RES_COLD |
F:IGNORE_ACID | IGNORE_ELEC | IGNORE_FIRE | IGNORE_COLD

The 'X' has changed, 'W' is being used a bit more now, and 'T' is new.

X:slot:rating:xtra

slot:   The 'slot' where the item is wielded. Seems superfluous to me. 
        Unchanged.
rating: The rating bonus for this level.
        Unchanged.
xtra:   If = 0, nothing happens,
        1 stands for "one random extra sustain",
        2 is "one random extra resist",
        3 is "one random extra ability".

So HA and DF have X:a:b:1, for instance, and the above Elvenkind armor gets its
high resist as desired.

W:level:rarity:weight:cost

level:  The object will only be generated before this dungeon level if it
        passes some obscure tests (like OOD objects)
rarity: The rarity of the object. Note that in my "emulate the old" e_info.txt,
        some 'common' objects have rarities higher than one, to make the 
        'distribution' of all ego-items of this tval more consistent with the
        old one.
        If you add a new ego-item, be sure to wizard-mode check its appearance
        frequency if you don't understand what I say.
weight: Currently unused. Unchanged.
cost:   Extra cost. Unchanged.


The really interesting is the T entry. Up to three T entries are possible for 
a single object. The format is

T:tval:min_sval:max_sval

The ego-item can only be generated from items of this tval, with sval in the
specified range. In the above example, Elvenkind armors can be generated from
soft (36) and hard (37) armor of any kind (0-99).

A Robe of Permanence has T:36:2:2, allowing only Robes to become 'of 
Permanence'.

Use your own creativity to do whatever you want with the empty slots.
The above are only examples, not playtested and not balanced.

Revision history of Team Angband:

Date	Version	Comments

10/8/99	  0.5.0 Some "team" functions have been implemented.  ^Nap allows
		you to deactivate the team while focusing on one player.
		^Leader tells all other team members to follow the current
		player like mindless drones, or mindlessly attack the
		presently (*)targeted monster.  ^Tagalong kicks team
		members which have dropped out of follow-mode back into
		follow-mode.

10/7/99	  0.4.0 Save files implemented, minor display changes.

10/5/99	  0.3.0 First playable version!  
		Players: view code, while still buggy, now allows the
		four characters to move about the dungeon and see at
		least what they should.
		Monsters: monsters now go after the nearest character,
		and attacks upon him damage him and not the first player.

9/22/99	  0.2.0 The characters can now enter the dungeon.  They all
		are placed into the same start room.  Also, they can
		all do things!  (The inventory, walking, fighting, etc. 
		code seems not to need further modification.) However, the
		refresh code is buggy as hell; they see what is in one of
		the *other* character's field of vision.

9/19/99	  0.1.0	The data structures and code are modified so that 4
		characters can exit simultaneously.  Four characters
		are created at start.  However, only the first 'leader'
		character appears, and only he can actually do anything.

Angband 2.7.9v5 for Windows requires several "extra" files, which aredistributed in a special "ext-win.zip" archive along with this "README"file describing what to do with the files, once you have extracted the"ext-win" directory.(1) Copy the subdirs in "ext-win/xtra" into the Angband "lib/xtra"directory, since some of them are used during execution.(2) Copy the files in "ext-win/src" into the Angband "src" directory,or wherever they need to go, for example, some of them, such as the"ANGBAND.INI" file, need to be in the same place as the executable,and some of them, such as the "ANGBAND.IDE" and "ANGBAND.RES" files,are only needed for certain compilers, and some of them, such as"ANGBAND.RC" and "ANGBAND.ICO", are needed for other compilers, andsome of them, such as "ITSYBITS.C" and "ITSYBITS.H" and "READDIB.C"and "READDIB.H", are needed to assist the "main-win.c" source file.--- Ben ---

**** 09/05/03

Wands are no longer vulnerable to lightning, now harmed by fire
Monsters now drop souls 1 time in 100

Big changes to how soul types are stored. Now every item has a soul source, and two soul types.
  Currently, the soul source is used for naming, and the second soul type is unused.
  Due to this change, un-imbued rings / amulets are now listed as "A Silver Amulet (Empty)"
Added 'E'valuate soul to soul dealer, this tells you how a soul will turn out.
Re-Implemented Scrolls, Potions, Food

Renamed soul coins to soul gems (makes more sense with setting it into jewelery)

Added to hit, to damage, and AC bonuses to soul types, and imbued items
Imbued items now only gain xp if a certain xp threshold is passed (xp = item level)

Soul data now provides a pval, that increases with level
Soul data no longer has it's pval / flags wiped out when loading savefiles

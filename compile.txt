The old Angband compilation instructions no longer work at all.
Instead use the make command corresponding to your OS:

Windows:
make -f Makefile.cyg install

Mac OS X (Nota bene: this does not currently function. If you can
	collect the proper headers and make the proper changes so that
	it compiles, please send a pull request with the necessary alterations):
make -f Makefile.osx install

Linux (Untested, but should work):
make -f Makefile.std install


Makefile.inc and Makefile.src are referenced by other makefiles, not to be used directly.

All other makefiles are deprecated, as far as I am concerned. Many are out of date,
and were I to support all 14 of the 'true' makefiles, I would spend all my development
time compiling and fixing portability bugs. If one works for you, great.

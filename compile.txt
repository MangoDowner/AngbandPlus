The following instructions are only tested on a Windows (XP) machine running Cygwin, with GCC as the compiler.

Unzip source code found here:

Open up the Cygwin command prompt, and go to the /posband folder (contains a number of files, including "pos099-cygwin.patch"). Type the following commands:

1) ./configure --with-win
2) patch -p1 <pos099-cygwin.patch

Once this is done, the executable can be built and rebuilt using the "make" command from the same folder.

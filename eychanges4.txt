Changes from 0.4.0b to 0.4.0c:

## Bug fixes ##

- If you couldn't see a trap, it wouldn't affect you (oops).

- Occasionally secret doors were visible before detected.

- Sometimes, broken/openend doors would appear to be closed.

- When you identified an artifact that ignores disenchantment but do not 
  *ID* it, you could get an incorrect message about it being vulnerable 
  to disenchantment.

- Light sources, musical instruments, rings and amulets were incorrectly 
  reported as being vulnerable to disenchantment.
  
- Character dumps would not display random resistances of items.

Changes from 0.4.0 to 0.4.0b:

## Gameplay changes ##

- Now, item info tells you what kind of attacks an item is vulnerable to.

## Bug fixes ##

- Monsters will no longer leave phantom "doors" when bashing locked doors.

- The object recall window now works correctly.

- Proper message when trying to browse a book in a store (note: it is still
  impossible to browse in a store, because the amount of reworking necesary
  to correct this exceeds the utility by far).

- Makefile.std corrected (thanks Darkgod and Keith Willoughby)

- You can no longer buy stuff in the shop using 'm'.

- Fixed message when a single item recharged.

- You could never learn the second component of an alchemical formula.

- Occasionally, player traps would be generated in the dungeon.

- Room descriptions could be generated jumbled.

- Inappropriate symbols could appear in room description titles.

- Several bugs associated with character dumps fixed.

- The browser will no longer crash if you press down when it's empty.

- Monster spoilers will now always include uniques. (You used to need to turn
  on cheat_know for them to be included because of a bug).

Changes from 0.3.6 to 0.4.0:

- Not compatible with 0.3.6 or older savefiles.

## Gamplay Changes ##

- Added room descriptions (taken from UnAngband). Each room now has a 
  description which can affect its contents. You can turn the display of room
  descriptions off by a gameplay option, and also display them in a terminal 
  window.

- Resistances are now percentile. Instead of having an on/off flag, there is 
  now a percentile value to each resistance. All resistance sources are now 
  cumulative. Also, all characters now have intrinsic resistances which rise 
  with level, and depend on race and class. This severly changes game balance -
  probably a lot of tuning will be necessary.

- Added an option to avoid displaying inscriptions in messages.

- Added an option to display a message whenever an item recharges. (Thanks 
  Behemoth)

- The monster list terminal now shows monster symbols. (Thanks Pav Lucistnik)

- Invisibility revised. Attacking no longer totally cancels temporary 
  invisibilty, just shortens it. Monsters far less likely to cast spells while 
  you're invisible.

- Alchemy rebalanced. Now, all potions have a pval which determines which 
  combinations they can be in.

- Added amulets and rings to the "squelch by quality" menu.

- Totally revised the item 'I'nspection display. It now uses similar code to 
  the monster recall. Also, it will correctly display resists and slays. 
  Finally, it display's the item's history. (based on David Sward's patch)

- The code for generating spoilers has been unified with the monster/item 
  recall code.

- No more self knowledge. Potions of *enlightenment* no longer provide the 
  ability. Potions of self knowledge and the self knowledge spell removed.

- Now, the object browser also supports item "r"ecall.

- Chests have been totally removed from the game. They will return in a future
  version, in a different form.

- The object recall term window now displays the most recent object recall.

- The character screen now only has two modes.

- You can now display the player's temporary conditions in a term window.

- If you're standing on a trap square, you can activate it by pressing '>' 
  (down). This is so thieves will be able to use trap doors/teleport traps 
  to escape monsters.

- New trap system - there is now an edit file that controls trap types 
  (trap.txt). Glyphs and locks have been re-implemented as traps. Many new
  trap types added.

- All players now have a chance to bypass a visible trap - going through the
  square without being affected. Thieves have a much higher chance than other
  classes.

- Character dumps improved (Thanks to Pav Lucistnik)

- Players can now "magic-lock" doors (well, actually only some classes can). 
  Magic-locked doors are very difficult for monsters to open/bash, but they
  can be easily opened by the player.

- Monsters unlocking doors no longer depends on their HP, but on their depth. 
  As a general rule, monsters will find it harder to unlock doors. However, 
  there's a new monster PICK_LOCK flag, which will make it easier for the 
  monster to unlock doors.

- Monsters bashing doors also now depends on monster depth, BUT the more 
  damaged they are, the harder it is for them to bash a door.

- Changed the pref file format so that trap types can be assigned graphics 
  (note that the modify visual command has not been updated). You need to 
  add "W:" lines for the trap graphics. Windows preferrences now need "T:" 
  lines, instead of "W:" lines. (yes, that seems to make little sense. But 
  since the trap info is called w_info and windows are called term windows, 
  that seemed to actually be the better way around. I'll probably revise the 
  way .prf files are handled in a future version to solve these problems.)

# Combat #

- Monsters with high AC (relative to your skill) now harder to hit. Bonuses 
  to hit now more important.

- Changed AC. Now, AC no longer reduces damage, but every point of AC is more
  useful in determining whether you will be hit or not. AC value has been 
  reduced for most items.

- Mana regenration much faster for characters with low mana. This will 
  hopefully allow low-level mages to keep up after the other changes. Also,
  note that spell/item damage has not been toned down, and so improved 
  relatively to weapons.

- Reduced the maximum damage enchantment bonuses for melee weapons, the 
  maximum level of rings of damage/slaying, and of ego items and artifacts. 
  Also, reduced the damage bonus from very high STR.

- Higher strength required to weild heavier weapons.

- Changed the calculation for amount of blows. This will be worse for most 
  characters. Dexterity is now a lot more important, as is class. 

- Weapon weight no longer affects the critical hits. Instead, they are 
  determined heavily by player level and to-hit skill.

- Slays/Brands multiplier lowered, but now they affect entire damage 
  (including bonuses).

- Many weapon weights lowered.

# Quests #

- Random quests are now all stored in the same slot, since there is no reason 
  to keep the history and it just wastes memory.

- Quest reward allocation improved, less likely to end up giving you only ammo.

# Spells #

- Armor penalties for spellcasters revised. Rangers, Bards and Mystics can 
  wear more armor before the penalty kicks in. Also, the penalty is now 
  non-linear, making for a low penalty for wearing a bit more than allowed, a 
  very high penalty for wearing a lot more.

- Spell list for most classes changed. 

- All calming spells made more powerful.

- New types of glyphs - lesser glyph of warding (available to mages), which is 
  lot easier for monsters to break than the normal glyph, and holy sigils, 
  which only block movement of undead and demons (but block all summoning), 
  and can be broken by any monster.

- Changed the way healing spells/items work. Now, They heal a percentage of 
  your damage (though each is capped at a minimum). So, for instance, cure 
  light wounds will always heal 5% of your, and cure critical wounds will 
  heal 30% of your damage.

# Races/Classes #

- Total reworking of race list:
  - Races removed: Half-elf, high-elf, half-orc, dunadan, half-troll, hobbit.
  - New races: Grippli (a frog-like race), Ursa (a bear-like race), Vargr 
               (a wolf-race), and Lizardman.

- New class: Thief. Thieves have moderate fighting skills, great stealth (which 
  improves with levels), and can tell the exact type of a trap by looking at it. 
  They also have the ability to place traps using the 'p' command. Currently, 
  this uses the Oangband trap system, because I didn't have time to implement 
  the system I wanted. This will change in future versions.

- Bards can now get 0% fail rate.

# Items #

- Item destruction has been toned down.

- Musical instruments are now indestructible (this might change in a future 
  version).

- Added new item flags that protect from certain effect in addition to the 
  resistances. Big thanks to Richard Smith for helping me assign them to the 
  proper items.

- Random artifacts removed. They will be back in a future version, once all the 
  changes to the item system are properly in place, but for now having them 
  around really complicates development. 

- Added armor prefixes. They work in a similar way to weapon prefixes.

- Added several new weapon prefixes.

- Added flexible slays - now, different weapons can have different levels 
  of the same slay.

- All potions now feed you a little (except for potion of salt water).

- Many new ego item types added.

- Added several items: Hatchet, Cleaver, Stout Stick, Three-Piece-Staff, 
  Blackrock Quarterstaff, Apples, Piece of Ambrosia, Mysterious Piece of Meat, 
  Silver Crown, Shirt, Potion of Stealth, Silver Arrows, Silver Bolts,
  Staff of Barriers, Talismans of Rapid fire/acid/frost/lightning bolts. 

- Removed several items: Lance, Pint of Nectar, Filthy Rag, potion of 
  self knowledge.

- The Beacon of Om now has an activation.

- The Massive Iron Crown of Morgoth now give +50 stats, not +125 - still more 
  than enough, but the old value could cause display problems.

- All potions now feed the player the same amount.

- Artifacts added: The Cleaver of Fendilo (Gumband).

- Artifacts removed: The Lance of Eorlingas,

# Monsters #

- Reorganized the letters for many monsters:
  - 'y'eeks have been removed.
  - 'l'ice have been removed.
  - 'F'lies have been removed (some flies become 'I'nsects).
  - 'g'olems are now 'A'utomata.
  - 'G'hosts are now 'g'hosts.
  - Giant 'P'eople are now 'G'iants.
  - 'p'eople split to low-level 'p'eople and high-level 'P'eople.
  - 'l'ycanthropes added.
  - 'F'aeries added.
  - 'Y'etis become 'y'etis.
  - 'M'ulti-headed reptiles become h'Y'dras.
  - 'z'ombies split into 'z'ombies and 'M'ummies.
  - 'H'ybrids become 'H'ags. (Harpies remain 'H's, but most other 'H's 
     becomes 'q'uardrapeds).

- Many new monsters added, many monsters removed, and many monsters changed. 
  Don't assume anything about monsters just because you know them in another 
  variant (or an older version).

- Elementals no longer fail when casting spells.

- New "ego" monsters, which currently are for flavor only and don't affect 
  gameplay.

- New monster flag: EVASIVE. Monsters with this flag have a chance of evading 
  your blows and blinking away.

- New monster spell: S_FAERY.

- Removed the ESCORT/ESCORTS and FRIEND/FRIENDS double-flag redundancy. Added a 
  new flag, MANY, which combines with a group (either kind) to make it larger.

- Removed the S_WRAITH monster spell. The wraith uniques are now handled 
  similarly to all other uniques.

- The POWERFUL monster flag has been renamed to the less confusing 
  WIDE_BREATH, and has been removed from all monsters without breath attacks.

- New attack methods: GRAB

- Monsters with stealing attacks now blink a shorter distance away.

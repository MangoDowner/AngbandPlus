Here is the source for Cat and the Hack Angband 2.8.51, a variant of Angband2.8.0 by neko (bmroot@nematic.ieo.nctu.edu.tw). See the file 'variant.txt' fora (quite verbose) description of the changes in the source I have made.I have made my changes _very_ explicit. All changed lines have comments by memade next to them. All of them contain the string '* ~' to facilitate grepand text editors with Find All features, such as BBEdit.The 2.8.50 release contained a couple small bugs that have been fixed:o    The nominal capacity of the player is now calculated correctly.o    The 'Allow generation of destroyed levels' option is set to 'yes' by	  default.

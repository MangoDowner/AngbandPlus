- The mac (carbon) port works
- The gcu work sorta-of works, but needs a lot done
- No other ports of Sangband are currently available


If you make a port of Sangband, please let me have (or know) the necessary stuff
to add to the general source release.



The "Gotcha" about porting Sangband:

     Sangband has code that allows it to switch between 25 lines and 50 lines on
command; this is called "hotscreen".  The game code uses this ability to do
various neat things.  This means that Sangband requires VGA.

     Any fully-functional port of Sangband must be able to display 25 or 50 
lines on demand, and (ideally) switch between two fonts in order to use the same
screen space in either situation.
     In the IBM port, doing this is trivial:  You set the game to require 50
lines, switch between the 8x8 and 8x16 system fonts on demand, and set a
function hook.  And that's all there is to it!

     Graphical ports, however, require a bit more work.  It is easy to just
compress a font down to half the size, and use just half the screen space
whenever the game is in 25-line mode.  However, this looks kinda ugly...
     The windows port works correctly; it stores two sets of fonts:  one for 25-line mode, and another for 50-line mode.

"xxx recovers its courage." sometimes doesn't get the monster name right.
I'm looking for the cause but this is not top priority right now. For the
moment, you'll have to put up with the occasional "(null) recovers its
courage." and other interesting messages.
This bug did not exist in Angband--. It appeared when I upgraded to 1.40
sources. Has monster_name been changed in 1.40?

Scrolls of Rumor are occasionally (very rarely) empty. Not top priority.

Hangups occasionally (very, VERY rarely). These have happened only when using
Nhsound, so I believe this is caused by memory architecture problems (too
little low memory). But to be sure, I recommend that you save often (& backup
the save file if you want to be really REALLY sure) - especially if you find
some great item.

Destroyed levels and levels of unusual sizes have no effect on the feeling
you get, the rating calculation ignores their plusses.

Routines that use the function getLine (such as death messages, rumors etc)
tend to garble up the following line in recall previous line(s).

A very minor bug - the graphical player character symbol is outside the
comparison range in tcio.c's print map. This means that the player will not
always show up on 'M'ap.

There is something wrong with the speed calculation/display in search mode.

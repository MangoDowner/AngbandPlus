A little note about the new separate dungeon, separate list feature:
There is no "old" directory, so don't go in dungeons that have T:old
entries in their d_info.txt listings.  If you want the "old" directory,
download Pern 5.0.1 or thereabouts and copy the text files into a 
directory named "/old".  When I get one of those rare round tuits
I'll fix up these problems.  When I release the maintainer's cut of 
1.0, I'll include everything, including save files, obsolete files,
old news.txt files, but the normal releases need to be small, so none
of those goodies.

Another little note:
When compiling the executable, make sure ALLOW_BINARY is not defined.
ALLOW_BINARY is not defined currently, but if you are thinking of doing so,
don't.  The reason is that the *.raw files won't work well together with the
separate dungeon files.

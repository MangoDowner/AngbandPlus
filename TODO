THINGS TO DO TO THE KERNEL
==========================

This list is excessively long at the moment, even though
I've been conservative wrt to what features the engine
should have in the first version.  The TODO-list for
the vanilla-variant is in variants/vanilla/TODO.


DUNGEON
 - trap-support not implemented
 - searching not implemented
 - integrate Room-code much more. 

TOWN
 - only black market-type stores "works" [FIXED]
 - no specialisable shops yet

SPELLS
 - no support for spells and spell-casting
 - also missing project() which is needed for balls and beams

MAGICAL ITEMS
 - No inclusion of effects on objects on monsters/players
 - No support for objects with ego-abilities or special properties
   (no protocol for extending it either)


SAVE/LOAD, SCORE and DEATH
 - 2/3 of save/load implemented
 - save/load misses events, shops, etc.
 - high-score saving not implemented [fixed, report detailed bugs now]
 - central saving of high-score and save-files not implemented
   [fixed, saves to ~/.langband/]


MONSTERS
 - extremely primitive AI, all monsters aggressive
 - none of the monsters behave as they really should
 - do not carry items or use items
 - no monster-memory
 - no monster-drops
 - no support for invisible or multi-hued monsters [FIXED]
 - does not know that monsters are unique 

COMBAT
 - no magical weapons done [barely started]
 - no ego-weapons done
 - no missile/thrown weapons
 - no special powers or bonuses used in combat
 - missing proper descriptions for attacks [somewhat improved now]

MOVING ABOUT
 - no torch-charges used or oil wasted for light (overridable?) :-)
 - no running
 - no stay still command [Maybe the key 5, stand-still is ok]
 - no resting and no regeneration [simple regen for hits added]
 - no map function
 - can see objects even outside range-of-vision [FIXED]


CONTAINERS
 - stacking doesn't work [barely working]
 - it doesn't understand that only one torch is used at a time. [FIXED?]


COMMANDS
 - no directed 'o'pen command
 - no wizard-mode
 - no 'D'estroy item command
 - eating, drinking, etc not implemented [q and u should work on potions]
 - no redraw of a screwed up screen
 - no 'L'ook command
 - no targetting command, e.g for missiles, spells, ..
 - no refill of lamps


OTHER
 - optimise FFI-code to be fast and not generate garbage, esp strings
 - missing project() which a lot of features need
 - messages are not saved or kept
 - no option-system [bad settings and parameter-system now]
 - no visual changing
 - no macro-system from within the game
 - fix protocol for "using" items in the game

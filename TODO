THINGS TO DO TO THE KERNEL
==========================

This list is excessively long at the moment, even though
I've been conservative wrt to what features the engine
should have in the first version.  The TODO-list for
the vanilla-variant is in variants/vanilla/TODO.


DUNGEON
 - trap-support not implemented
 - searching not implemented [more or less fixed]
 - integrate room-code much more.


STORES/TOWN
 - specialised shops has no restrictions on buy
 - buying ignores amount
 - no home-code
 - no restock of shops
  

SPELLS
 - no support for spells and spell-casting
 - also missing project() which is needed for balls and beams

MAGICAL ITEMS
 - No inclusion of effects on objects on monsters/players
 - No support for objects with ego-abilities or special properties
   (no protocol for extending it either)


SAVE/LOAD, SCORE and DEATH
 - 2/3 of save/load implemented
 - save/load misses events, shops, flavours, ...


MONSTERS
 - extremely primitive AI, all monsters aggressive
 - none of the monsters behave as they really should
 - do not carry items or use items
 - no monster-memory
 - no monster-drops
 - does not know that monsters are unique
 - does not generate groups of monsters

COMBAT
 - no magical weapons done [barely started]
 - no ego-weapons done
 - no missile/thrown weapons
 - no special powers or bonuses used in combat
 - missing proper descriptions for attacks [somewhat improved now]

MOVING ABOUT
 - no torch-charges used or oil wasted for light (overridable?) :-)
 - no running
 - no resting and no regeneration [simple regen for hits added]
 - no map function
 - no infravision, invisible support


CONTAINERS
 - stacking doesn't work [barely working]
 - it doesn't understand that only one torch is used at a time. [FIXED?]


COMMANDS
 - no directed 'o'pen command
 - no wizard-mode
 - no 'D'estroy item command
 - no 't'akeoff command
 - eating, drinking, etc not implemented [q and u should work on potions]
 - no redraw of a screwed up screen
 - no 'L'ook command
 - no targetting command, e.g for missiles, spells, ..
 - no refill of lamps


OTHER
 - fix updating of fields, bonuses, etc on player and monsters in an
   extensible way.
 - integrate effect and element-code in a good way.
 - optimise FFI-code to be fast and not generate garbage, esp strings
 - missing project() which a lot of features need
 - messages are not saved or kept, should be done on the c-side.
 - no option-system [bad settings and parameter-system now]
 - no visual changing
 - no macro-system from within the game
 - fix protocol for "using" items in the game
 - fix the problematic area on object-creation/definition
   in a way that is overridable by variants. 
 - fix a more spiffy home-page [got mascot]
 - find a way to copy active-objects in a rational way (and which
   respects subclasses), e.g for picking up one of a group of objects

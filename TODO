THINGS TO DO TO THE KERNEL
==========================

This list is excessively long at the moment, even though
I've been conservative wrt to what features the engine
should have in the first version.  The TODO-list for
the vanilla-variant is in variants/vanilla/TODO.


DUNGEON
 - trap-support not implemented [more or less there]
 - chest traps not there
 - searching not implemented [just misses chest-traps]
 - integrate room-code much more.


STORES/TOWN
 - specialised shops has no restrictions on buy
 - buying ignores amount [fixed]
 - no home-code
 - no restock of shops
  

SPELLS
 - no support for spells and spell-casting
 - also missing project() which is needed for balls and beams [partly done]
 - need 'L'earn spell, 'b'rowse spells and improved 'm'agicking


MAGICAL ITEMS
 - No inclusion of effects on objects on monsters/players
 - No support for objects with ego-abilities or special properties
   (no protocol for extending it either)


SAVE/LOAD, SCORE and DEATH
 - 2/3 of save/load implemented
 - save/load misses events and shops, ++


MONSTERS
 - extremely primitive AI, all monsters aggressive
 - none of the monsters behave as they really should
 - do not carry items or use items [not in v0.1]
 - no monster-memory or monster-lore
 - no monster-drops [fixed]
 - does not know that monsters are unique [fixed, miss some features]
 - does not generate groups of monsters [fixed, simple, but working]
 - does not register temporary effects on monsters (or cuts, stun, ..)

COMBAT
 - no magical weapons done [barely started]
 - no ego-weapons done
 - no missile/thrown weapons [almost fixed for missiles, some misfeatures]
 - no special powers or bonuses used in combat
 - missing proper descriptions for attacks [somewhat improved now]

MOVING ABOUT
 - no torch-charges used or oil wasted for light (overridable?) :-)
 - no running
 - no resting and no regeneration [simple regen for hits added]
 - no map function
 - no infravision, see-invisible support [done]


CONTAINERS
 - stacking doesn't work [barely working]
 - it doesn't understand that only one torch is used at a time. [FIXED?]


COMMANDS
 - no directed 'o'pen command
 - no wizard-mode [partially added]
 - no 'D'estroy item command
 - no 't'akeoff command
 - eating, drinking, etc not implemented [q and u should work on potions]
 - no redraw of a screwed up screen
 - no 'L'ook command
 - no targetting command, e.g for missiles, spells, ..
 - no refill of lamps
 - add 'u'se again


OTHER
 - find a good way to integrate stats
 - fix updating of fields, bonuses, etc on player and monsters in an
   extensible way. [a decent system found for player, started work]
 - integrate effect and element-code in a good way. [very hard]
 - optimise FFI-code to be fast and not generate garbage, esp strings
 - missing project() which a lot of features need [is more or less there now]
 - messages are not saved or kept, should be done on the lisp-side.
 - no option-system [bad settings and parameter-system now]
 - no visual changing
 - no macro-system from within the game
 - fix protocol for "using" items in the game
 - fix the problematic area on object-creation/definition
   in a way that is overridable by variants. 
 - fix a more spiffy home-page [got mascot]
 - find a way to copy active-objects in a rational way (and which
   respects subclasses), e.g for picking up one of a group of objects
 - find a good way to represent stat-information, preferrably via
   generics+classes and controlled by variant-code
 - add print-* methods for poison, confusion, ...
 - integrate DAMGE functions/methods

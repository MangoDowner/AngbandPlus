-1.0.1-

Fixed priest/paladin spell list, dungeon books were broken
Changed title in files.txt, 'V' command gives correct info now
Removed limit on number of traps when in nightmare mode
Activations of wands/staffs/rods/artifacts do not use player level anymore

-1.0.2-

Nightmare mode clears the map every player turn now, instead of each round

When in astral and nightmare modes, cannot get below level 97 when
descending more than one level at a time
Also, does not continuously forget the map

Astral characters can now move through walls, and start with
lanter/oil or torches, as walls are not lit up

Choose classes at start of game. Hit ESCAPE to stop choosing classes

Got rid of restriction on rogues/tricksters that they could only have
one other class, can't remember why I decided to do that anyway...
Half-elves can only have 2 classes now, not 3

Gets attribute bonuses/penalties from all classes now
Second class now needs twice as much experience, third *3. fourth *4
Skills are an average of what is granted to each available class
HP are based on average of hitdie from all available classes
Mana/Piety are displayed regardless of which class is active, and are
initialised properly at character birth

Added realm information on character info screen. Character can have a
magery realm (magic or illusion) and a prayer realm (holy or death)

Equipment : spellcasters get first spellbooks, everyone except monks
gets a melee weapon, archers and rangers get a missile weapon and ammo
Warriors : chainmail

Priest or Death Priest : ! of cure critical wounds
Rogue or Trickster : scroll of teleport
Ranger : fur cloak
